You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and might be a tempting enough price for her to consider, especially if she's motivated to sell.  If she rejects, Bob still has 8 rounds left to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's counteroffer, but it's getting closer to his target price. Bob is willing to continue negotiating to see if he can secure a lower price.  There are still 7 rounds left, providing ample time for further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  He's increased his counteroffer to $8,800,  which is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows he's serious about buying the product and willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price below $9,000. With 6 rounds left, Bob has time to continue negotiations if this offer is rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is now within Bob's budget and only $500 more than his last counteroffer. With only 5 rounds left, Bob doesn't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, saving him $1,000 compared to buying from John."
