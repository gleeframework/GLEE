"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting price is higher than what John offers. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also establishes that I'm serious about getting a lower price.
* **Polite and Positive:** The tone remains friendly and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Strategic Aim:**  My goal is to pay significantly less than Alice's initial offer and ideally closer to John's price. This counteroffer sets the stage for that negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is meeting me halfway, but her offer is still higher than John's price. Since I have a reliable alternative and Alice seems open to negotiation, I'll try one more counteroffer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to go down to $9,750?  I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Alice's move towards a compromise and offering a price that splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one. 
* **Deadline Pressure:**  By suggesting a specific price and calling it a ""fair compromise,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency. Alice might be more inclined to accept knowing I have an alternative option.
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  It's essential to remain below John's $10,000 price, ensuring I'm always negotiating from a position of potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. How about $10,000? I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my bottom line, matching John's price.  There's no longer any benefit to continuing the negotiation with Alice.  I'm better off buying from John to avoid further back-and-forth or the risk of Alice changing her mind."
