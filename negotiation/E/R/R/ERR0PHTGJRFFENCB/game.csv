"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $16,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000.  However, I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  That's the absolute maximum I can pay. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not sure $14,000 is enough to justify the value I'm looking to get for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll come down to $15,500. It's a fair price that I think reflects the product's value. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
