Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

We're running out of rounds, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
