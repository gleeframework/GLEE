"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go up to $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. $140 is closer, but still a bit out of my budget. How about $110?  That's a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $110, which would be $125. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
