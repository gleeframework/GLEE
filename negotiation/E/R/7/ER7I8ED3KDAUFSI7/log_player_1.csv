I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

$75 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a compromise and agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $82 is slightly higher than what John is offering. It's worth accepting to get a slightly better price."
