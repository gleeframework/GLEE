"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high for us both, but I am hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we aim for $850,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a substantial discount.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. While $900,000 is an improvement, I still feel there might be room for a better agreement. How about we aim for $875,000? I believe this could be a satisfactory price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm open to finding a fair price, $875,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's compromise at $890,000. This is a significant discount for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution here.",890000.0,Alice,5,
