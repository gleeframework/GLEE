"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,800,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product's potential, $1,800,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a fair price for my product. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's a lower price than the initial offer, it's still higher than his budget. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a fair compromise considering my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
