"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product's potential, $1800000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a fair price for my product. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000, which is a fair compromise considering my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
