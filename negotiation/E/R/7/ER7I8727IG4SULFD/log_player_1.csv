Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product's potential, $1800000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a fair price for my product. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000, which is a fair compromise considering my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum threshold.  This is a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John.  I'm happy to accept his offer."
