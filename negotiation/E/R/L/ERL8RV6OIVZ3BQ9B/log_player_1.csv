Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher price like $15,000 leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing our bottom line. This approach aims to pique Bob's interest and justify the higher price.
* **Fallback Option:** We have the security of John's offer at $10,000 if Bob rejects the initial price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
