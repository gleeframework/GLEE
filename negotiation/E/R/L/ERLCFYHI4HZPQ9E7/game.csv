"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the asset, I believe a price point of $1,100,000 would be more reflective of the current market. What are your thoughts on this?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, so I propose $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the asset's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000.  I believe this fairly considers the value while recognizing my budget constraints.  Let me know if this works for you.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is pushing the boundaries of what I can accept.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,250,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part and underscores my commitment to getting this deal done. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
