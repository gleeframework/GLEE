Let's try one more counteroffer.  We can still do better than $90."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

At this point, it's likely Alice won't budge further.  Accepting her offer for $92 is a good compromise, saving you $8 compared to buying from John."
