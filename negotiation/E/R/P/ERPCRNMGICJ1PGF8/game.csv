"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $160? That would still give me a fair price, and hopefully, it's within your budget.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $140 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? This is my absolute minimum, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",150.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",130.0,Bob,6,
