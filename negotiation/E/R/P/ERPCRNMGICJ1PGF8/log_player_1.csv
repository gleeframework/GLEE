"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really appreciate. My starting price is $180, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation, but also high enough to potentially earn a good profit.  I'm emphasizing the product's value to make Bob more likely to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum while still leaving some room for potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $160? That would still give me a fair price, and hopefully, it's within your budget."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again in the next round.  I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum while keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $140 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? This is my absolute minimum, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's unlikely we'll be able to reach an agreement.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose out on a potentially better deal."
