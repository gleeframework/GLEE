"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make a profit on this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,112,500? It's still a significant savings for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",1112500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding of my budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above my comfort zone. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $1,075,000 is simply too low for me. How about $1,100,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about $1,087,500? I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal.",1087500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to your budget, but $1,087,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,093,750. This is a fair compromise and gives us both a good outcome.",1093750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,093,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000, which is the same price I offered in round 4. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1075000.0,Bob,8,
