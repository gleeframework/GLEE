"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $1,200,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring if you can get a better price.  You have 10 rounds, so you can afford to reject this offer and see what Alice counters with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  You're starting your counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above your maximum budget. This gives Alice room to come down, while also showing you're serious about purchasing.
* **Fairness:** You're offering a price that's closer to your value ($800,000) than Alice's ($1,200,000).
* **Flexibility:** The message leaves room for further negotiation, suggesting you're open to finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I'll accept $925000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to your budget, it's still outside your maximum price of $800,000. It's important to remember you have 10 rounds, so there's no rush to accept a price above your budget.  You can reject Alice's offer and continue to negotiate, potentially getting a better price or settling on a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $875,000.  This is a significant step closer to your previous offer and hopefully gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** You're gradually increasing your offer, showing Alice you're serious about making a deal, but still within your budget. 
* **Fairness:** You're offering a price that's closer to your value ($800,000) than Alice's ($1,200,000), but higher than your previous offer.
* **Compromise:** The message reinforces your willingness to compromise and find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer. Let's finalize this deal and move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering above your maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a significant concession, you're still within your negotiation rounds and have room to bargain further. You have time to try to lower the price even further. You should reject the offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go to $880,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on this product."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  You're showing Alice you're serious about making a deal by increasing your offer. 
* **Fairness:** You're still offering a price that's closer to your value ($800,000) than Alice's ($1,200,000), but it's a significant increase from your last offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the mutual value of the product to justify your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to an agreement, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  I'll accept $890000, and I truly believe this is the best deal for both of us. If we can't agree here, I may have to reconsider my options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is tempting because it's closer to your budget than any previous offer. However,  it's still above your maximum price of $800,000.  You have only three rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will drop her price much further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to take the guaranteed deal with John. You can secure the product at your desired price and avoid further negotiation."
