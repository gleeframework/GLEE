"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it's slightly above Alice's value, accepting Alice's offer at $11,500 is the best move for Bob. Here's why:

* **Savings:** Bob saves $500 compared to buying from John. 
* **Below Limit:** The price is still under Bob's $12,000 limit. 

Even though there's a chance of getting a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer, it's a risk. There's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and Bob could miss out entirely, forcing him to buy from John at the higher price."
