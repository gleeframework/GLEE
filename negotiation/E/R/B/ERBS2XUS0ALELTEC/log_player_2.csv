"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $115.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you have a clear goal to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price. You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $100, so there's room to find a price that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to go down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
