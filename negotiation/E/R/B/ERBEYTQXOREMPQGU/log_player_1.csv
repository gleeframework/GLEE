Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a great deal for you.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 ensures you won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines."
