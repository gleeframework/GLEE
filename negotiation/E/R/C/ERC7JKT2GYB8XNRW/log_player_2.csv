"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it would be a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $140.  Since you're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice values the product at $120, there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get a lower price!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
