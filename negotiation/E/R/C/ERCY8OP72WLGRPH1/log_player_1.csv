Round 2
Bob's offer:

I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850,000 to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm afraid $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $825,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I think the product's value to you is higher than that.
