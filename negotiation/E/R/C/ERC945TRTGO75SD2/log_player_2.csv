"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $9,000, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is actually higher than her initial offer of $9,000. This suggests Alice might be trying to push for a higher price.  While Bob wants the product, accepting this offer would be a step backward.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows Bob to try and bring the price down again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. Offering $8,800 is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a favorable price. This also demonstrates to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is even higher than her previous offer of $9,800.  This suggests Alice is not truly interested in negotiating and is trying to push for a higher price.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to continue attempting to bring the price down and potentially reach a compromise before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between Alice's last offer of $10,200 and Bob's previous offer of $8,800.  $9,200 is a significant increase from Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise and potentially reach an agreement within a few rounds.  If Alice rejects this, Bob can still purchase from John for $12,000, making this offer a calculated risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is continuing to increase, demonstrating a lack of willingness to negotiate. This is approaching Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  There are only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will come down significantly in price. 

Given the limited time and Alice's stubbornness, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000 to avoid further negotiation and potential disappointment."
