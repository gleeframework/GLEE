"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you, but I can't go below $10,500.  This product is truly unique, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  How about we split the difference and agree on $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the original price was $12,000 and you're now offering $10,500. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
