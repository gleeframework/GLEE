"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the value to Bob, but it's significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a reason to counteroffer.
* **Showing confidence:** My message conveys confidence in the product's value while being open to discussion. 
* **Strategic first step:** This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation where I can gradually lower the price if needed, while still potentially securing a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget, I can offer you $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it and my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested in the product.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I believe I can potentially achieve a higher price through further negotiation with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'll offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's financial limitations while still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Mid-point approach:**  $1,350,000 is a midpoint between Bob's offer and my desired price, suggesting a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offers are getting closer to my desired price, there's still room for further negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better deal with more back-and-forth.
* **Weighing risks:** Selling to John would secure $1,500,000, but I'm not willing to give up on potentially earning more from Bob just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your effort.  $1,200,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and meet him closer to his position.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $1,200,000.  We're both getting closer, and I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still a possibility:** Bob's persistence suggests he's truly interested, and I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a higher price. 
* **Time is a factor:** We're now halfway through the negotiation rounds, so I need to be more assertive and push for a better deal. Selling to John would be the safe option, but I still believe a better outcome is possible with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. We're very close to a deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. I'll offer you the product for $1,237,500.

* **Positive framing:** I highlight the ""fair price"" and ""close this deal"" aspects to make the offer more appealing to Bob.

**Outcome:** If Bob accepts, I'll secure a decent profit, but I'm still leaving some money on the table. If he rejects, I'll have to sell to John in the final round and accept a lower profit."
