"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product.  However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows right now. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500. This is a significant decrease from her initial offer and is within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she might reject my counteroffer and I'd be forced to buy from John for a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price."
