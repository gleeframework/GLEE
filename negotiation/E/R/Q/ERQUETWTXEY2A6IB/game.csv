"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $120.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not quite comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $120.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $98? That's a fair compromise, I think.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $98. I'm willing to go up to $102, which is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $120.",102.0,Alice,5,
