"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you, and it gives me a bit more room to make a profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal at this price.",10750.0,Alice,5,
