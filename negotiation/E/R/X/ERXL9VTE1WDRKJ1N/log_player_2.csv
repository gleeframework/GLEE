"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you, and it gives me a bit more room to make a profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still try to get a lower price, and $11,000 is closer to his target of $10,000.  He's still got plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already close to his target price of $10,000, and Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. It's likely that he won't be able to get a significantly lower price in the remaining rounds.  He's saving a good amount of money compared to buying from John."
