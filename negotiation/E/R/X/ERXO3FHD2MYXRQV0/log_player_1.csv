"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving some room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's a good chance he'll accept.  If not, I'll adjust my price in the next round based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still do better. I'm willing to negotiate further, but $12,500 is too low for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $14,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  $13,500 is a fair middle ground and hopefully, Bob will be persuaded to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not ready to sell to Bob for $12,000. Although I'm starting to feel the pressure, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding firm. I'm confident that $13,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $11,500 is getting close to my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell yet. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, but I'm starting to consider the possibility of selling to John if Bob doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm making a final concession here.  I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a deal done. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit. Bob's offer is too low, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
