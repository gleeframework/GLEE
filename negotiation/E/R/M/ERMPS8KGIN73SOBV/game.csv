"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. I understand there's a gap between our valuations, but I believe $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing $875,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
