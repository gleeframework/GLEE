Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $925,000. This is a unique opportunity, and I'm eager to see it in your capable hands."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This opening offer allows me to potentially secure a high price while still having the option to negotiate down if needed. I always have the safety net of John's offer ($800,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). It's clear he's trying to negotiate a very favorable deal for himself. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about the product's value and am willing to walk away from the table if necessary.  This sets the stage for a more reasonable counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. I understand there's a gap between our valuations, but I believe $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing $875,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** I've made a substantial move from my initial offer, coming down by $50,000. However, I'm not meeting Bob in the middle. My offer is closer to my desired price point than his, reflecting my stronger position.
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the product's value and positions my counter-offer as a path to a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" encouraging Bob to move closer to my price.
* **Strategic Retreat:** While I'm willing to negotiate, this offer keeps me well above my safety net ($800,000 from John) and allows room for further adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below my ideal price, it's now above my safety net of $800,000 from John. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely, potentially forcing me to settle for the lower amount from John. 

Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate or losing the sale to Bob altogether."
