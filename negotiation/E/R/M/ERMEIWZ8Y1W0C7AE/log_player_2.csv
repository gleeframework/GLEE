Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. It's unlikely she'll go below $110, and we can get the product for $100 from John. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
