{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

While $110 is closer to your desired price range, it's still above your $120 limit. There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice."
