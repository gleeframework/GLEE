"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120.
* Alice is offering it for $115, which is lower than your value and a better deal than buying from John for $120. 
* Accepting Alice's offer saves you $5."
