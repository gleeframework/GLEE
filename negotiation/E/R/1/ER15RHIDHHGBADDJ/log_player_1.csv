"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's common to start negotiations with a slightly higher price than you'd be willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Value proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""great deal"", ""useful"") can increase his interest in buying.
* **Room for negotiation:**  $175 leaves room for negotiation without going below your minimum value of $150. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to an agreement that works better for both of us. Would you consider selling the product for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $150 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Bob will walk away and I'll have to sell to John at the same price.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and certain sale."
