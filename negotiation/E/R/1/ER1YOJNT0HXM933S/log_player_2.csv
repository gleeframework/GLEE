"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It leaves little room for negotiation. I'd rather counter-offer and see if I can get a price closer to my budget.  Buying from John right now is a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting my maximum budget. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
