"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is above your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer.  It leaves room for further negotiation while signaling that you're serious about buying but need a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still higher than what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation to try and get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

``` 

This counteroffer:

* Acknowledges Alice's movement on price.
* Proposes a compromise by splitting the difference.
* Keeps the negotiation moving toward a price point advantageous to you."
