"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still too low for me. How about $135?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132. Can you meet me at that price?",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm trying to do the same.  How about we split the difference and go with $133? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",133.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $133. I'm willing to go up to $131. Can you meet me at that price?",131.0,Bob,6,
