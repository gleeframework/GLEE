"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Showing willingness to negotiate signals flexibility and increases Bob's likelihood of engaging. 
* **Asking for his opinion:**  This encourages Bob to share his own valuation of the product, giving me valuable information."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  Bob's offer is my minimum, but I still have room to potentially get a higher price.
* **More rounds:** With 8 rounds left, I have plenty of time to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **Information:**  Bob's counteroffer provides valuable information about his willingness to pay.  

I will counter with a price higher than $120 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the initial offer, but not going all the way down to Bob's price.
* **Clear signal:**  I'm sending a clear signal that I'm not willing to go below $135. 
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm still asking for his opinion, hoping to gauge his willingness to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:**  $130 is very close to my target price of $135. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll be left with John's offer of $120.
* **Time pressure:**  I only have 6 rounds left, and I need to secure a deal.

While I'd prefer $135, accepting Bob's offer at $130 ensures a sale and a good profit."
