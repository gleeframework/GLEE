"Thank you for the offer, Alice. $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for us to negotiate.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your perspective, we need to maintain a balance between our interests. I am proposing to reconsider the price to $850,000 for the product. This still offers a significant discount compared to its value, while ensuring we cover our costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to go to $825,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve a successful outcome.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I've considered your offer carefully, and I would like to counter with a price of $837,500 for the product. This reflects a compromise that maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while still being attractive to you.",837500.0,Alice,5,
