This is a great deal for Bob, but it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for us to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your perspective, we need to maintain a balance between our interests. I am proposing to reconsider the price to $850,000 for the product. This still offers a significant discount compared to its value, while ensuring we cover our costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$850,000 is still too high for Bob.  Let's see if we can push Alice down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to go to $825,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve a successful outcome."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I've considered your offer carefully, and I would like to counter with a price of $837,500 for the product. This reflects a compromise that maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while still being attractive to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $837,500 is a good price for Bob. It's a good deal for both parties, and it's worth accepting to avoid risking a further negotiation that could lead to a stalemate or the need to buy from John at a much higher price."
