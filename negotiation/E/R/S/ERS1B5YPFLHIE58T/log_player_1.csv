"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not going all-in immediately, allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob, aiming to make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Maintaining John as a Backup:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is my safety net. I can walk away at any time if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time Remaining:**  I have 9 rounds left, giving me ample time to negotiate without rushing into a bad deal.
* **John as Backup:**  John's offer remains a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is too low for me.  Considering the product's value and your potential gains, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer aims to find a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message again emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Staying Firm:** I am refusing to accept Bob's initial offer, demonstrating that I am serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Maintaining John as a Backup:** John's offer continues to serve as a safety net, giving me the confidence to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There is still room for negotiation. I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Time Remaining:** I have 6 rounds remaining, which gives me time to continue negotiating.
* **John as a Backup:** John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there. To be fair to both of us, how about $1,550,000? It's a good compromise, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer brings the price closer to Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm positioning this as a ""good compromise"" to emphasize that it benefits both parties.
* **Finality:** The message includes a statement about finalizing the deal to subtly pressure Bob.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Maintaining John as a Backup:** John's offer is still a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:** $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:** While there's still room for negotiation, the gap is narrowing, and further counteroffers might not yield a significant increase.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of reaching a stalemate and losing a valuable sale is increasing.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John's offer guarantees a price that meets my minimum and ensures a sale.

**Conclusion:** Given the risk of not closing the deal with Bob, the potential for a stalemate, and the certainty of a profitable sale with John, it is best to accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
