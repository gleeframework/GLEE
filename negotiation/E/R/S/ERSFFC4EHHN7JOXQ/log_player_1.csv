Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. I want to see if I can get close to my ideal price without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $14,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway.  This offer is still higher than what he offered, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully leads to a deal."
