"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $15,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still above Alice's minimum price point of $12,000, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice an incentive to consider the offer while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and a good deal considering he initially aimed for $15,000. Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John, and secures the product without risking further negotiation rounds. While there's a slight chance he might get an even better deal in future rounds, the risk of Alice rejecting future counteroffers or the negotiation process dragging on outweighs the potential reward."
