"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While I'm willing to sell for $120, I want to see if I can get more. Bob's initial offer is my minimum, but I'm hoping for a better price.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Not a Good Time for John:** Selling to John right now would mean accepting Bob's minimum price, which is not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is my minimum, but I'm willing to come down a bit to $150.  This reflects the value of the product and would allow me to make this deal worthwhile.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:**  I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not rejecting it outright.  I'm offering a counteroffer that's still higher than his offer but is more reasonable than my initial price.  
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to keep the dialogue open and encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to come down to $150, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in round 4, and each round brings us closer to the possibility of having to sell to John at my minimum.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting this offer keeps the door open for potential future business with Bob. If he sees the value of the product and I've made a good impression, there could be opportunities to sell him other products at a higher price in the future."
