"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. If you're interested, let me know. If not, I'll be selling it to someone else.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  He can get the product for $800,000 from John. Accepting Alice's offer at $1,000,000 would cost him more."
