"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can still get the product for $8,000 from John.  It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the product for as close to his maximum budget as possible.  Offering $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $10,000, but it's still a reasonable price for Alice considering the product is worth $12,000 to her. This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still keeping Bob within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, but it's still above his desired price.  Since Bob can purchase the product from John for $8,000, it's the most financially sensible option at this point. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her rejecting further counteroffers, ultimately leading to a worse outcome for Bob."
