"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1400000. I believe it holds great value for you, and this price reflects that.  While I could easily sell it to another buyer for a higher price, I'd prefer to work with you if possible.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I accept it, I will be paying $200,000 more than I need to, which is not ideal. Buying from John would save me $200,000, so I'll choose that option.
