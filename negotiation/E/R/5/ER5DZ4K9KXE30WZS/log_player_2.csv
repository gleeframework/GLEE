"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth more than $12,000 to you. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a price of $14,000 for the product. This is a fair deal that respects its value while leaving room for both of us to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her ($15,000), it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget ($12,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  This would still be a good deal for you as it's well above your minimum.  Let me know if you're open to this price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
