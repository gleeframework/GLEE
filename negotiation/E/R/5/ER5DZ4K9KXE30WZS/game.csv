"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth more than $12,000 to you. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a price of $14,000 for the product. This is a fair deal that respects its value while leaving room for both of us to benefit.",14000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  This would still be a good deal for you as it's well above your minimum.  Let me know if you're open to this price.",12500.0,Bob,2,,
