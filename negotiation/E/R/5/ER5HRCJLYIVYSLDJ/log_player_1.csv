"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's priced very competitively. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $9500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but it's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal and would like to counter with $9600. This is my best offer within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,600 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,650? It's a small difference, but it would mean a lot to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9650}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I am willing to pay $9625 for the product. This is the highest price I can afford while staying within my budget. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $9,625 is still significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
