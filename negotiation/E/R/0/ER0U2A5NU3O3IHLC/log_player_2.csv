# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $900,000? This price still allows for a significant profit for you, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.
