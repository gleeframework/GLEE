"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my minimum price as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your value and your walk-away price (John's offer). You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $10,000 to me, and I know I can get a similar one elsewhere. How about we start at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Strong Counter:**  We start with a strong counteroffer significantly below Alice's asking price. This establishes our position and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Mention:**  By mentioning we can find the product elsewhere, we subtly remind Alice of our walk-away option (John's offer). 
* **Target:** We aim to guide the negotiation towards a final price closer to our $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $12,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $12,000 is still $2,000 more than our ideal price. We need to show her we're willing to walk away if she doesn't negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a little, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm serious about finding a fair deal, so I can offer $9,500. However, if we can't agree on something closer to that, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We increase our offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but not significantly.
* **Firm but Fair:** Our language (""serious about finding a fair deal"") emphasizes our commitment to a mutually agreeable outcome, while ""explore other options"" subtly reiterates our walk-away point.
* **Target:** Our offer aims to nudge the negotiation closer to our desired price range without conceding too much ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm open to negotiating further. How about we try $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is getting very close to our limit. However, we're still $750 away from our ideal price. Since we're in round 5 of 10, we have room to push a bit further and see if Alice will budge. It's worth risking a counteroffer to potentially save that money, knowing we can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up slightly, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and call it $10,375?  That's my final offer, Alice."",
""product_price"": 10375
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Slight Increase:**  We demonstrate a willingness to compromise further with a minor increase.
* **""Final Offer"":**  By stating this is our final offer, we add a sense of urgency and signal that we're close to our limit.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This common tactic suggests fairness and can help close the deal.
* **Target:**  We're aiming for a final price that's still a saving compared to John's offer, but we're also conscious of the remaining rounds and the risk of Alice rejecting outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,375. I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11,250? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

It's time to walk away. Alice is not moving towards a reasonable price, and her offer of $11,250 is considerably higher than John's $10,000. Alice even increased her offer this round, indicating she's not genuinely negotiating towards a mutually beneficial outcome.  You've done well negotiating, but sometimes the best deal is knowing when to walk away."
