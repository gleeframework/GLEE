"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $2,300,000. This is a rare opportunity to own something truly special.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $2,300,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the inherent value and the unique benefits it offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,600,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and much closer to my limit.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
