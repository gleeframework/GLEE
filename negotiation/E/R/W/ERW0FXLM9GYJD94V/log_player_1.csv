Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 allows room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds the price too high. He might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price above your minimum.
* **Psychological Pricing:** A higher initial offer can sometimes make the final price seem more reasonable if Bob manages to negotiate it down."
