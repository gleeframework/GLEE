"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering its worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging my value for the product. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still within Bob's budget of $15,000.  There's a chance that Bob could get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John outweighs the potential for a small savings."
