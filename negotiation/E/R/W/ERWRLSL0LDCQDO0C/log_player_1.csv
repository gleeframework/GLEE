"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $130 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you meet me somewhere around $75? That would be a great deal for both of us.

You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers, say $87? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, it is unlikely he will reach a price that is significantly better than what John is offering.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob short and secure the guaranteed sale."
