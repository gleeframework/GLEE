"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose $725,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your latest offer doesn't reflect the value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000, but that's my final offer. I believe this is a fair deal considering the product's worth.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to propose $720,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",720000.0,Bob,6,
