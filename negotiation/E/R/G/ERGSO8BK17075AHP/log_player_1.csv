I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This leaves a lot of room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit over my minimum value of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a compromise that meets halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will entice Bob to accept while still giving me a good profit."
