Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($120) might prompt Bob to negotiate further, potentially increasing your profit.
* **Maintain Attractiveness:**  While $119 is a high price for Bob (given his valuation of $100), it's still within a reasonable range that might tempt him, especially if the message emphasizes the product's value. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the guaranteed sale to John."
