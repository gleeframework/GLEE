"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $9,500 is close to your maximum, but there's still room for bargaining."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, that's a good starting point. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $9,000 which is a good price.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking a further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or the need to buy from John at $10,000."
