I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a starting point, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price of $12,000. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly below my minimum price, but it's still a better deal than selling to John. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
