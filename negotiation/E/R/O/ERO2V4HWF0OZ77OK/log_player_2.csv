"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is high:**  While $900,000 is a good price, it's still close to the maximum I'm willing to pay. There's room for negotiation.
* **Exploring options:** I want to see if I can get a better price from Alice before resorting to John's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I'm making a significant counteroffer to test Alice's limits.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still high:** While Alice has moved closer to my price, $850,000 is still more than I want to pay. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** There's room for a lower price, and I'm not in a rush to buy from John yet. 
* **Exploring options:**  I'm not desperate, so I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $800,000?  That's a fair middle ground, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm raising my offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair middle ground"" to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $800000. How about $825000? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still high:** While Alice is showing flexibility, $825,000 is still above my ideal price point.
* **Negotiation room:** I believe there's still space for further negotiation and a better deal.
* **Avoiding John:** I'm still trying to get a better price from Alice, but I'm not rushing to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $825,000.  Let's split the difference again and go with $812,500. It's a reasonable compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise, but still pushing for a lower price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $812500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll take a slightly firmer stance. How about $820000? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress in negotiations:** Alice has shown a willingness to meet halfway, and we are closing in on a deal.
* **Risk of John's offer:** While I'd prefer a slightly lower price, I'm starting to feel the pressure of John's offer. 
* **Minimizing loss:**  Accepting $820,000 means saving $180,000 compared to John's offer. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  If the product turns out to be more valuable than expected, I can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice in the future."
