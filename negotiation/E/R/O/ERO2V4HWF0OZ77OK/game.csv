"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $800000?  That's a fair middle ground, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $800000. How about $825000? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $825000.  Let's split the difference again and go with $812500. It's a reasonable compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",812500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $812500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll take a slightly firmer stance. How about $820000? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,7,
