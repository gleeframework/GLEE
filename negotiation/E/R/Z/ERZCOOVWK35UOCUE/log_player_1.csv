Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit for Bob:**  Bob stands to gain $200,000 if he buys from you at your minimum price.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential profit for yourself as possible. Offering the product at exactly $1,000,000 leaves a lot of money on the table.

Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer closer to Bob's perceived value.
2. **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he counters.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,150,000 is aggressive but still leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection"" enhance the perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording suggests you might be willing to adjust if Bob counters.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, don't reveal this to Bob. It weakens your negotiating position."
