Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting high, aiming for a million dollars. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe the product has the potential to be worth that much to Bob.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if he's serious about purchasing at a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $925,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's. I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price,  Bob's offer of $875,000 is only $75,000 away from my minimum value.  It's unlikely he'll go higher, and I risk losing the sale altogether if I continue to reject offers.  It's time to accept and secure the sale."
