"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  This would give you a good price and allow me to get closer to my target. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
