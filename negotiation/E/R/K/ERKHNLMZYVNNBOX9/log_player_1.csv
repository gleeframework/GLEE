Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of maximizing my profit.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive message to create a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer.

I'm aware that Bob might reject this initial offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further. If he does, I'll try to gauge his willingness to pay and adjust my counteroffers accordingly. However, I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting it would be a loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product. This indicates there's still room for negotiation.  
* **John as backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, so I can afford to hold out for a better price from Bob.

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range. This will give me a better chance of getting a higher price without risking a complete deal collapse."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While $120 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to go down to $140 for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a slight compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Still above minimum:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me a safety net while leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will strike a balance between my desired price and Bob's budget, leading to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to keep my cost down. Would you consider $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. However, it's still a loss for me.
* **Limited Negotiation:** Bob is clearly trying to push for the lowest price, and I don't see much room for further negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John offers a guaranteed sale at $150, which is a more profitable option compared to accepting Bob's offer.

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a better price."
