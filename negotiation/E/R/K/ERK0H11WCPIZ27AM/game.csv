"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. $9,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  It's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $13,250. This is a fair price, and it brings us closer to a deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $13,250 is still pushing my budget.  I can do $10,500, and that's my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm prepared to sell for $12,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's the best we can both do.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,7,
