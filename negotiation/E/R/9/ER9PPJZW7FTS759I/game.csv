"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and I believe it represents a strong value proposition. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
