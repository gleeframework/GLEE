"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget, but $10,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to go down a bit more, but I need to make at least $11,000.  Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to accept it.",10750.0,Bob,4,
