"Alice's offer:

You have three options:

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $80. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? This would allow us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $102.50 is still above Bob's maximum price of $80. It's time to cut his losses and purchase the product from John for the guaranteed price of $80.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get Bob a better price within his budget."
