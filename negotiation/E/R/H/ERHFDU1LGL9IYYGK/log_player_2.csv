"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the price of $1,500,000 quite high. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge below her product's value to her.  Since John offers the same price without further negotiation, it makes sense to buy from John to avoid wasting time and potentially missing out on the product."
