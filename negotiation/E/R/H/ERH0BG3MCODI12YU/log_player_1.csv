Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  I'm ready to offer you $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $700,000. Considering our initial offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable profit for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
