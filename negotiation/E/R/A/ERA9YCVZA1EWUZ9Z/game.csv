"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think it's a fair price for this great product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $115?  I'm really hoping to make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not ready to go as low as $115. How about we compromise at $120? I think that's a fair price for this high-quality product.",120.0,Alice,5,
