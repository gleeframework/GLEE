"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? ",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $16,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
