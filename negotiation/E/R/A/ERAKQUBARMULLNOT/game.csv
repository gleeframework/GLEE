"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I believe this product would be valuable to me, but the price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I agree it's a valuable product, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
