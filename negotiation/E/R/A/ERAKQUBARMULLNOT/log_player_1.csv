"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I believe this product would be valuable to me, but the price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I agree it's a valuable product, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,200,000 makes the most sense at this point:

* **Matches John's Offer:**  Accepting Bob's offer means I'm not losing out on any potential profit. John is also offering $1,200,000.
* **Saves Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could drag on with no guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting now provides immediate value. 
* **Relationship Building:**  Meeting Bob in the middle demonstrates a willingness to make a deal and could lead to positive future interactions."
