"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject and counteroffer to try and push the price higher. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I think I can push for a higher price and get closer to my desired amount. I'm also still considering John's offer, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my previous counteroffer, but I think it's a fair compromise.  It's still above Bob's last offer, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent amount for the product, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
