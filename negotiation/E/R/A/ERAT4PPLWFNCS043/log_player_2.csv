"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this unique product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. While I'm interested,  $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to receive a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a slightly better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,075,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,060,000. This price would allow me to secure the product and you to still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,070,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is very close to Bob's ideal price and within his budget.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 5 rounds left, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. 
* **Risk of John:**  Buying from John for $1,200,000 is more expensive, and there's no guarantee of a better deal in the remaining rounds.

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's within his acceptable range."
