"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. While I'm interested,  $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to receive a fair price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,075,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,060,000. This price would allow me to secure the product and you to still make a profit.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,070,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
