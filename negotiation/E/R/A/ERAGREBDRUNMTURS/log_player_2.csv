Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to consider $1,025,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. What do you think?

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,025,000, and it's not worth risking missing out on John's guaranteed $1,000,000 price."
