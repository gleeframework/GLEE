"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to consider $1,025,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
