"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to go down to $10500, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a great deal for you, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
