"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to a fair agreement. I propose selling the product to you for $100. This price not only reflects the value it holds for you but also ensures a reasonable profit for me. Let me know if this offer suits your expectations and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You'd get the product for $100, which is less than your maximum budget of $120.
* **Buying from John:** You'd pay $120, which is your maximum budget.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:**  This forces you to buy from John for $120, which is a worse outcome than buying from Alice. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most beneficial option as it saves you $20 compared to buying from John."
