""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $9,000?"",

* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting lower, even if this offer is rejected, it establishes a baseline for future counteroffers and keeps the negotiation closer to my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I am unable to match the price you've proposed, but I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering $10,500 for the product?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, but it's still above John's offer. There's a chance to negotiate further and potentially meet in the middle or get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Reasonable:** This offer directly proposes a price that matches what John is offering. It's a clear signal of my target price point.
* **Justification:** By saying ""meet in the middle,"" I'm highlighting a sense of fairness and compromise, encouraging Alice to see it as a reasonable resolution. 
* **Final Push:** While I'm willing to walk away and buy from John, this offer gives Alice a final chance to secure the sale at my desired price."
