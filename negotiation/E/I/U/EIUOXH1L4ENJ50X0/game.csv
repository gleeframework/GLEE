"Hi Bob, thanks for the counter offer.  While I understand your position, I can't accept a price that low. Could you meet me halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your original offer.  While $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me, I could do $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and land at $1,200,000?  I'm eager to find a good compromise so we can make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? That's a fair offer considering I can buy it for that amount elsewhere.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
