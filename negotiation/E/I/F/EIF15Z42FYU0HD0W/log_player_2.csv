"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,150,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be worth it for you.  This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a good margin for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in proceeding.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than your $1,200,000 maximum budget and cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
