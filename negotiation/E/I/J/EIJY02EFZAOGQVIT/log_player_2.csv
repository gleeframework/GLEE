# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You'd pay $9,000 from Alice vs $10,000 from John.
* **Even though you value the product at $10,000, getting it for $9,000 is a good deal.** You are saving $1,000."
