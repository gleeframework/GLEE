"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident it's a price that offers substantial value for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my  maximum budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
