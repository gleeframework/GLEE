"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still fair given its value, and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $950,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
