"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $3,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating a lower price.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,000 less than John's price:** This means Bob can still save a significant amount of money by accepting Alice's offer.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth the effort:** While a lower price is always desirable, the potential savings from further negotiation are relatively small. The risk of Alice rejecting the next counteroffer and potentially increasing the price could make it less profitable than accepting the current offer.

Overall, accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 is a good balance between saving money and avoiding the risk of a potentially more expensive outcome."
