"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a better price than John's $120, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There's room for both of you to get a better deal.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $100, but still higher than her perceived value of $80. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still offering you a substantial saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point.  $95 is still a good deal for you, and further negotiation might not yield significant savings.  Accepting Alice's offer saves time and effort compared to continuing negotiations."
