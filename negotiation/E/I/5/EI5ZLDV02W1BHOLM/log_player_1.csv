Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high as to be immediately rejected.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a starting point to bargain from. 
* **Knowing my Fallback:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I can afford to be somewhat flexible with Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and conversational tone can help keep the negotiations amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.**  I'm looking to get at least $1,000,000 for the product.
* **There's room for negotiation.** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, it's not unreasonable. 
* **Selling to John is still an option.**  I can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000, but I'm willing to try and get closer to that price with Bob.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm looking to get closer to $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This would still be a significant value for you and would allow me to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value to Bob.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm staying polite and encouraging further discussion.

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's close to my desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $875000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $825000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value.** I'm aiming for at least $1,000,000 for the product.
* **Negotiation is getting tedious.** While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's repeated rejections and low counteroffers are making the process frustrating. 
* **Time is money.** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take too much time and could result in further concessions from my side.

I've reached a point where selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most efficient and profitable option. It ensures I achieve my minimum desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob potentially leading to a lower price."
