Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $10,000, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your original valuation. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my initial valuation, it's still below my desired price point. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
