{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $95, you're aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (as it's below his maximum valuation) while maximizing your potential profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, getting the highest price from Bob is the optimal outcome."
