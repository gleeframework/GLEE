"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you.  I propose a starting price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,400,000 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and feel involved in the process. 
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value helps justify the high price.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind the standing offer from John ($1,000,000) as a fallback if negotiations with Bob falter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both his perceived value ($1,500,000) and my initial asking price. There's room for negotiation. 

Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about obtaining a price closer to my target. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation, knowing I have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value this product brings to your business is significantly higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a great deal."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($1,200,000) and my previous asking price ($1,400,000). 
* **Emphasis on Value:** Continue to highlight the benefits Bob gains, justifying the higher price point.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By proposing a ""middle ground,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to move closer to my desired range.
* **Safety Net:**  John's offer is still in my back pocket if negotiations become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we settle on $1,250,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,250,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding my minimum by $250,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Continuing to push Bob might make him walk away. There's a risk he'll lower his offer or end negotiations altogether.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate capital that can be reinvested or utilized elsewhere. 

While I could potentially extract more from Bob, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential reward at this point. It's a good business decision to accept a favorable offer on the table."
