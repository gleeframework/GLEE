"I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $12,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $14,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about my costs. How about we settle on $15,500? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to give a bit of a discount for the sake of the deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
