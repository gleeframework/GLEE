Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'll make one more offer that's closer to your budget. I'll sell the product to you for $90. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.

Alice has come down to $90, which is closer to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm confident that John will sell me the product for $80, which is my maximum price. I'm going to buy from John and save $10."
