# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $600000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This would be a significant saving for you, and would let us both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
