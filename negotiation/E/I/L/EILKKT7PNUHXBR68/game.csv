"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product at a price of $1000000.  It's a steal considering its true value, and I believe it will be a significant asset to you.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm offering $600000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $600000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. ",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm prepared to offer $750000. This would be a significant saving for you, and would let us both walk away feeling good about the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
