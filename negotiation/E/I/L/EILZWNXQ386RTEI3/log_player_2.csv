"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his valuation as possible. A counteroffer of $8,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still higher than Alice's value. This will likely incentivize Alice to accept the offer while still allowing Bob to save a decent amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has demonstrated that he is willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving incrementally closer to Alice's valuation while still trying to maximize his savings. $8,750 is a compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway, but it's still above Alice's value, making it a potential win-win situation."
