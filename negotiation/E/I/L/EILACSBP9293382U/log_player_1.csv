Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  $15,000 is a significant markup from your minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your minimum price, potentially making Bob more receptive to the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob or accept his rejection knowing you have a fallback option with John."
