"Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and this price reflects that.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Would you consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground here.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $13,500.  My final offer is $15,500.  It's a very fair price for what you're getting.",15500.0,Alice,5,
