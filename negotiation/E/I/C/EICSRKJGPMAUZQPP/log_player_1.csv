Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Unknown Information:**  You don't know if Bob has other options or how eager he is to buy.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Aiming too high might make him walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  The message is positive, emphasizing the product's value and fairness.
* **Price:** $1,350,000  is a strong starting point. 
    * It's significantly above your minimum ($150,000 profit).
    * It leaves Bob with a potential gain ($150,000 below his perceived value).

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower."
