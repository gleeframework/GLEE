Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think!

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is still above my budget. How about we settle on $98? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I want to sell the product to Bob, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, so it's the safest option at this point."
