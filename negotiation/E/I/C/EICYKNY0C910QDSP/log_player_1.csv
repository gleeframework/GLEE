Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high ($11,500) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in his mind.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your initial offer without trying to negotiate too much.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're not losing out. You have a guaranteed buyer in John."
