Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

It's clear Alice is not budging significantly from her offer. It's unlikely she will go below $800,000, and continuing the negotiation might not yield a better outcome. It's time to cut losses and buy from John."
