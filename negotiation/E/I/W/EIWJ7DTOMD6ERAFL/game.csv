"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $170 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $155. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $155 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $140. This is my final offer, as I can buy it elsewhere for less.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $150. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $145. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
