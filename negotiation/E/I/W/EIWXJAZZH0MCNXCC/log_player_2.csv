"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $14,000 is higher than Bob's maximum value. 
* **Better Options:**
    * **Rejecting the offer:** Opens the opportunity for negotiation and potentially getting a lower price.
    * **Buying from John:**  This is a fallback option, but Bob wants to try and get a better deal. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can start the negotiation process and potentially get a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Counteroffer:** $13,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's maximum budget.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is not willing to pay a premium price. This opens the door for further negotiation and potentially finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $13,500 is closer to Bob's desired price and within his budget.
* **Better Options:**
    * **Rejecting the offer:** While further negotiation might be possible, there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate.
    * **Buying from John:** This is still a fallback option, but Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's desired price.

**Strategy:** Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product at a price closer to his maximum value without risking further negotiation and potential stalemate."
