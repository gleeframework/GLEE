Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had so far, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" Alice subtly creates a sense of demand and desirability around the product. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat out rejects it, Alice knows she can go to John. If Bob counter-offers, there's room to negotiate.

**Important:** Alice's strategy is based on the fact that she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price. This gives her leverage in the negotiation."
