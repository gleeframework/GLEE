Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's valuation is lower than yours, but a higher initial offer helps gauge how much he truly values the product. If he outright rejects it, you know to move closer to John's offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the value beyond the price can make the offer more appealing, even if Bob is aware it's worth less to him objectively. 
 
**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some time and flexibility. If you need to sell the product quickly, a price closer to John's offer might be more strategic."
