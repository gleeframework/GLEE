"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do any better on the price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still finding it a bit high. How about we settle at $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're ready to make a deal!",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to offer you $1,175,000. This is my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already met you at my lowest price. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,200,000. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to sell the product to someone else who is willing to meet my minimum price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
