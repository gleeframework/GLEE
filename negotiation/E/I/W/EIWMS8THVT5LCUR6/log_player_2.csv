"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a special deal just for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $10,500 is still above my budget of $8,000. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering it to you for $10,250. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,250, which is still above my budget of $8,000. At this point, I'm not confident that I can negotiate her any lower.  It's better for me to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $8,000.  It's a guaranteed deal at my desired price."
