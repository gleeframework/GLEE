"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value, and I know it will be a great asset to you.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $9,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market rate. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $9,800 is still a bit low for me, but I'm ready to be flexible.  Let's compromise on $10,200.  This price reflects the product's value and our desire to finalize this deal. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I think this price is more in line with the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
