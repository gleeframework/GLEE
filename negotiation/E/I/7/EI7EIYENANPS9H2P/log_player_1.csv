Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $900,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still allows room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A $900,000 sale is still profitable for me, and leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Start negotiation positively:** A friendly approach can encourage Bob to participate in the negotiation process. 
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired minimum of $1,000,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  This shows Bob that I am serious about my asking price and not willing to settle for a significantly lower amount.
* **Explore further negotiation:**  I can now counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Preserve the option to sell to John:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, selling to John still guarantees my minimum desired profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $900,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This allows for both of us to find a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $875,000 is a compromise that meets me halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer and reiterate my desired price while proposing a compromise. This conveys my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance.
* **Focus on a Win-Win:**  The message highlights a ""mutually agreeable price"" to emphasize the benefit of reaching an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a higher price:**  $875,000 is still closer to my desired profit than Bob's offer.
* **Signal flexibility:**  Showing a willingness to compromise can increase the chance of reaching a deal.
* **Keep the pressure on Bob:**  This encourages him to reconsider his offer and potentially increase his bid."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $825,000 is getting too close to his initial value estimate of $800,000 and significantly lower than my minimum desired profit of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better price, and the risk of further concessions is too high.  

Therefore, selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees my minimum profit and avoids potentially losing more money in a protracted negotiation with Bob."
