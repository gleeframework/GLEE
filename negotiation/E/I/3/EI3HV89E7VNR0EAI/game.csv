"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is less than $10000. I'm looking forward to hearing your response.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is less than $10000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be honest with you, I'm really struggling to justify the cost. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, and that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're really struggling to justify the cost, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000. I've already gone as low as I can, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $11000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,7,
