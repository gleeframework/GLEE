"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The price is still lower than my minimum of $12,000, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and focuses on a ""great deal"" for Bob. 

This strategy aims to quickly gauge Bob's interest while leaving enough room for a potential deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product. This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Protecting my Value:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is the guaranteed outcome. However, I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price, as long as it doesn't jeopardize my minimum requirement. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value for the product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the deal more likely.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why my price is still fair.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum of $12,000, ensuring I'm not losing money.

This counteroffer allows me to potentially close the deal while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he might walk away entirely. I've already been through several rounds of negotiation and am getting closer to a deal.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures a sale and prevents potentially losing the opportunity to John. 

While $10,250 is less than my ideal outcome, it's still a decent profit and a good result considering the limited time and potential risks involved in further negotiation."
