Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth $1,000,000 to me. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still thinking that $1,000,000 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his valuation, but it's still significantly lower than his actual perceived value of the product. We have room to negotiate and time is on our side."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $1,000,000 and unwilling to budge.  We've made significant concessions and are now getting close to John's offer.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk Bob continuing to lowball us or the negotiations falling through entirely."
