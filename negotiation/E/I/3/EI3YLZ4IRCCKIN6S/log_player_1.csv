We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and see if we can negotiate Bob up a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget.  I'd be willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

It's getting close to the point where the risk of Bob walking away outweighs the potential gains from further negotiation. Accepting $950,000 is a very good deal."
