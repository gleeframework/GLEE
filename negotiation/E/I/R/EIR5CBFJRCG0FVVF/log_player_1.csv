"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum price of $100.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum.  I think this price is fair, considering the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement.  To avoid further rounds of negotiation and ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100."
