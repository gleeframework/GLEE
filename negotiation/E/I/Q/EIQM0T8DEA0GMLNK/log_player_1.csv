Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net at $100 if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $119, you maximize your potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob. He gains $1 in value (his $120 valuation minus the $119 price), and you secure almost the entirety of the potential profit."
