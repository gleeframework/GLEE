"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However, $1100000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm prepared to offer you $1050000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1050000 is closer to what I'm hoping for,  I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and it would allow us to move forward quickly.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $1075000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1062500. This would be a good middle ground, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.  What do you say?",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about splitting the difference, but $1062500 is still below what I need to accept. To move forward, I'm willing to go down to $1068750. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident it's a price that will allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal, shall we?",1068750.0,Alice,5,
