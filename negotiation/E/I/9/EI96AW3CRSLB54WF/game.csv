"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $1400000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000 to make this deal work.  This is still a significant discount from my original price, but it's the lowest I can go while still making this a worthwhile transaction for me. Let me know if you're interested in continuing our negotiations.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
