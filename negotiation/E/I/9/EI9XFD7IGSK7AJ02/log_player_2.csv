"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and the initial counteroffer should be aggressive but reasonable.  A $150,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant discount but still within the realm of possibility considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice.  

This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation, allowing Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than what Bob could get from John.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially driving the price higher is too great.  

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option to secure the product while minimizing financial risk."
