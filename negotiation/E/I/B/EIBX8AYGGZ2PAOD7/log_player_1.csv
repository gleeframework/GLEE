Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $80. Would you consider selling it for that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your understanding of my budget. However, I still believe that $80 would be a fair price for both of us. Could we possibly meet closer to my desired price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

Bob is clearly anchored at $80 and unlikely to budge significantly. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
