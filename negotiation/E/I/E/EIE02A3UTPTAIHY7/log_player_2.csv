"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer.  You are looking for a product worth no more than $80 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher than that. It makes sense to try to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great price for a product that's worth so much. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than your desired price of $80. You can still try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not able to go that high.  How about $90?  It's a fair price considering we're both getting closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference at $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to your desired price, you are still looking for a product worth no more than $80. You can still try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's meet in the middle at $92.50. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
