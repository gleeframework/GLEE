"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great price for a product that's worth so much. Let's make this deal happen!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not able to go that high.  How about $90?  It's a fair price considering we're both getting closer to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference at $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's meet in the middle at $92.50. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally make this deal happen.",92.5,Bob,6,
