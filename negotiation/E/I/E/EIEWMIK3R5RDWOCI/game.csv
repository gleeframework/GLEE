"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,012,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that's closer to the product's true value. I counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
