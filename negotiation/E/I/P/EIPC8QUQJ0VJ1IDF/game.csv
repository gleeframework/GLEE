"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,450,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. It's a significant compromise on my part, but I'm hoping you can meet me halfway.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
