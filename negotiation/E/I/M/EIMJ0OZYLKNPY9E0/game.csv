"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the competitive price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $8500?  I'm very interested in your product, and I think this price is fair considering what it's worth to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $9000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9000. I'm willing to compromise again. I'll meet you at $9200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
