"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would be a win-win for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $9,250 is closer, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my minimum expectation. Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,
