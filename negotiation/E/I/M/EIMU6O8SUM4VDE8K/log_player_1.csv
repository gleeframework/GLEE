Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so any price below that has the potential to be accepted.
* **My Value:** I value the product at $10,000, so any price above that is a profit for me.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $10,000 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product for my minimum value.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 discount, which is likely appealing, while still giving me a substantial profit.

By offering a price that is closer to Bob's perceived value, I increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer, maximizing my profit."
