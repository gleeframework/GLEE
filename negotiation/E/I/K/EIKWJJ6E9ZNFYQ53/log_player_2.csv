# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?

It's a good deal, but you can likely do better.  You'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business.

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good deal. While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
