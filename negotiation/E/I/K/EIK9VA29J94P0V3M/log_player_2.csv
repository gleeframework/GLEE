"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it would be a highly beneficial acquisition for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000. By rejecting her offer, you can leverage John's offer to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed to buy from John at the maximum price you're willing to pay."
