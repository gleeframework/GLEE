Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it would be a highly beneficial acquisition for you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **High but Reasonable:** The price is high enough to represent the product's value to Bob but not so high that it's insulting or immediately rejected. 
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a more aggressive initial offer to Bob."
