Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This strategy will hopefully force him to negotiate and potentially increase the price he's willing to pay. However, if he rejects this offer, I have the option of selling to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm not willing to settle for that price right now. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, but if he's not willing to budge, I'll take the guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still remaining above what Bob offered.  This shows flexibility while still holding out for a price closer to my target.  If Bob still rejects this, I'll likely have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still offering a significantly lower price than I am willing to accept. While $950,000 is better than his first offer, I'm not convinced he'll budge further.  It's better to take the guaranteed sale to John and avoid any further negotiation risk."
