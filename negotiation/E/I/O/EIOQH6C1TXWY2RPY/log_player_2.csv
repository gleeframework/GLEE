"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth to you is at least $12,000. Considering this, I propose we aim for a fair transaction that reflects both our interests. I would like to offer you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. This price not only respects the value you see in it but also ensures a profitable transaction for me. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
