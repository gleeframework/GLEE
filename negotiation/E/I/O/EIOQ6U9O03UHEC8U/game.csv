"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique and valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, but I need to stay within that range to make this work for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
