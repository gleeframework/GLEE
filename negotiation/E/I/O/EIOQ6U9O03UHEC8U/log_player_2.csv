"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique and valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my budget.  It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, but I need to stay within that range to make this work for me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
