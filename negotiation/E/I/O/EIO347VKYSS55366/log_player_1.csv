Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $100 is below Bob's valuation of $120, giving him room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for some back and forth to potentially reach a higher price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is less than the initial offer of $100, it's still a good deal for you. It's above your minimum of $80 and likely means a quicker sale. Holding out for a higher price risks Bob walking away or dragging out the negotiation process."
