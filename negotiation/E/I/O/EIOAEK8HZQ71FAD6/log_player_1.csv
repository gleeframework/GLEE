Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. 

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's always a chance Bob might be turned off by the initial high price. Negotiation is about finding a balance and reading the situation."
