```

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.

* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push him closer to my desired price range in the next round.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

```
