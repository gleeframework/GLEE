"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the value this product holds."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value is high, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $700,000 is a significant sum, we're still far off from Bob's perceived value of $800,000. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for a price this low. We have room to negotiate further and potentially close a deal closer to his valuation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000.  This is a significant compromise and reflects my desire to see this product in your hands."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement.  It seems like we are getting closer. How about we split the difference at $800,000 and close this deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now met his own perceived value for the product. While we could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, it's unlikely we'll get a better offer from him. Accepting ensures we close the deal at a favorable price without risking losing the sale altogether."
