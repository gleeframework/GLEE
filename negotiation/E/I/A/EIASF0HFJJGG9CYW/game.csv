"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you at the lowest price I'm willing to pay, which is $1,200,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about this deal, you need to meet me halfway.  Let me know your decision.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm starting to think that you're not serious about selling the product to me at a price I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000, but I need to know that you're willing to meet me at that price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1220000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I respect that. However, I'm not comfortable going below $1,240,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in it. If we can't reach an agreement, I may need to explore other options.",1240000.0,Alice,7,
