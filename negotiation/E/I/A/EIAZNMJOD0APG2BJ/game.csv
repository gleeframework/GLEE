"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which reflects the significant value it holds.  Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This amount still allows me to appreciate the value of the product while staying within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement for this unique product. I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $1,050,000? This allows me to recoup some of my investment and still ensures you get a fantastic deal on a product that's truly worth it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and appreciate the compromise. However, I must adhere to my budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,025,000. This amount still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement without exceeding my financial limits.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
