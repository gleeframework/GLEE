"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, it's still above your $80 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still above your ideal price of $80. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing your commitment to finding a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $90 is closer to my target price of $80, but still leaves some room for profit for Alice.  Accepting this offer means I get the product for less than John's price and avoid further negotiation, which might risk Alice getting frustrated and rejecting any further offers."
