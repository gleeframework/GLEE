"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation but not giving away too much in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to the middle ground.  I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to negotiate and come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can get him to budge further.  I'm also starting to consider the possibility of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering again at $10,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm starting to feel the pressure to make a decision, but I'm not giving up yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging on his price, and I'm running out of time.  While $8,800 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value and I'm starting to get worried about running out of rounds. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000 to ensure I get my minimum value."
