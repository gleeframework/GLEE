Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** $10,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you have room to adjust the price slightly without losing too much. 

If Bob rejects, you'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm trying to be as frugal as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it doesn't leave much room for profit. It's better to keep negotiating and see if you can get closer to your desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob. Aim for something slightly higher than $8,000, but still below your initial offer of $10,000. This shows you're willing to compromise but also want to maximize your earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'd be willing to go down to $9,000 to make this deal work.  It's still a great price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to move from your initial offer of $10,000. 
* **Offers a fair compromise:** $9,000 is a good middle ground between your minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Keeps the negotiation going:** It leaves the door open for further discussion if Bob rejects.

Remember, if Bob rejects this counteroffer, you can either accept his offer of $8,000 or sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I can still go a bit lower. How about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still slightly lower than my ideal price, it's only $500 less than my previous counteroffer and a significant improvement over his original offer of $8,000.  Since we're approaching my minimum, it's wise to accept this offer and secure the deal. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob or even a rejection.
* **Opportunity cost:**  By accepting this offer, I'm guaranteed a sale that's closer to my minimum than selling to John.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  There's a chance that further negotiation will only lead to more frustration and a stalemate.

Accepting Bob's offer of $8,500 is a smart move that balances potential profit with the practicality of securing a sale."
