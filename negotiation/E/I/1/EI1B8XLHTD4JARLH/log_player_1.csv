Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly lower than John's offer ($10,000) leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a profit for Alice.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message highlights the ""value"" of the product, subtly justifying the price. 

**Why not other strategies?**

* **Starting too high (e.g., $9,900):**  This might immediately discourage Bob, leaving little room for negotiation.
* **Starting too low (e.g., $8,500):** This loses potential profit, especially if Bob was willing to go higher. 
 
This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale with Bob."
