"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. I believe you'll find the value exceeds this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 

Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your upper limit and her own valuation of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  You should aim for a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a good deal.

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us insight into how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about considering the product at a price of $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your desired price range, there's still room for negotiation. Her offer of $10,500 is closer to your starting point than her initial offer, suggesting she might be willing to go lower. By rejecting and countering, you can try to secure an even better deal without risking going over your $15,000 limit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $9,500 is the highest I can go. If that works, we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between your last offer ($9,000) and her current offer ($10,500), demonstrating willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Setting a Firm Boundary:** By stating this is your ""highest,"" you signal a degree of finality, encouraging Alice to accept if she wants to avoid losing the sale.
* **Staying Below Limit:**  Crucially, this offer keeps you safely below your $15,000 maximum purchase price."
