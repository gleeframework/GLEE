"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is a bit out of my budget at the moment. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is still a discount from my initial price. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer, and I won't go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
