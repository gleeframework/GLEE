"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $750000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's unique features and rarity.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $800000.  This is a fair price considering my initial offer and your previous counter. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
