Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to start by aiming higher to see if I can get a better deal. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $15,000 allows room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price higher than $10,000.
* **Maintain Positive Relationship:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the value to Bob and inviting open communication. This helps maintain a good relationship even if he rejects the initial offer.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits beyond the $10,000 valuation."
