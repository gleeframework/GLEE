"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you at $2,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I'm motivated to find this product a good home, I believe its true value is closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet halfway at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from $1,900,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To be frank, I have another interested buyer who sees its worth more in line with my initial offer. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. If you're serious, I'm willing to accept $1,850,000. This is my final offer.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about the other interested buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle between my last offer and your current offer, so I'll counter with $1,725,000. I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1725000.0,Bob,6,
