"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1600000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe the value I offer is exceptional.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a price higher than that."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1550000, recognizing the value this product holds for you.  This price still allows me to reach a profitable outcome. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $1,550,000, which is still within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not budge and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure the product at a price that's only slightly above your maximum limit."
