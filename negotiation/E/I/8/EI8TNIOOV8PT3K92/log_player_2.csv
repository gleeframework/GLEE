"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

It's not worth buying the product from Alice at $12,000 when you can get it from John for $10,000.  Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a better deal or gives you the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, giving you room to potentially reach a compromise. It also signals that you are serious about buying the product but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what John is selling the product for. It's more beneficial to purchase from John at this point, as the price is within your budget and you're guaranteed a sale."
