"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure you'd put it to good use. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than both her value ($8,000) and what you're willing to pay John ($12,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price, potentially closer to her true valuation."
