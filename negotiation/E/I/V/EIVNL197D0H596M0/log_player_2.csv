"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible while staying within his budget. He offers $10,500, which is still a decent profit for Alice, while giving Bob a significant discount. This is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer and still above his budget.  It seems Alice is not willing to negotiate further.  At this point, buying from John for $10,000 is the most sensible option for Bob, as it guarantees the product within his budget."
