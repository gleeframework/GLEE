"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not going any higher than that. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",12500.0,Alice,5,
