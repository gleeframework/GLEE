Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and interested in the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking Bob what he thinks, signaling that I'm open to negotiation. 

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I'm increasing my chances of getting a good price while also keeping the conversation positive and open to a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 seems a bit low for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer a higher price, accepting his offer ensures a sale and guarantees me my minimum value.  There's no benefit in rejecting his offer and risking a longer negotiation that might result in a lower price or even a failed deal."
