Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which would still leave you a healthy profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
