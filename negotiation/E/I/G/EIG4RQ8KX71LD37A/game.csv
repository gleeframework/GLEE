"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its potential value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which would still leave you a healthy profit. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It represents a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
