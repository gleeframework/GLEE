"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $15,000. This is way above your budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
 
You are aiming to save as much money as possible. You can start by making a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price, hoping to start a negotiation that leads to a mutually beneficial deal.  $11,000 is a good starting point. You are still leaving room for potential negotiations but pushing for a fair price closer to your value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has lowered her price, $13,500 is still above your desired value. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can secure a better deal.  You can attempt another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

You've shown Alice you're serious about getting a good deal, and her counteroffer suggests she's willing to negotiate. This time, you're going to raise your counteroffer to $12,500,  which is closer to your limit but still leaves some room for a compromise. You're demonstrating flexibility, but it's important to be firm in your desire to stay below $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down on price, but $13,000 is still over your limit.  It's worth a final counteroffer to see if you can close the deal for a price you are comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12250}
```

You are getting close to your limit, but it's worth one final push.  This counteroffer is close to your ideal price, and might persuade Alice to accept.  If she rejects, you have the option of going to John, as you are at your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is now offering $12,800, which is above your limit. While you've shown her you're serious about getting a good deal, it's becoming clear that Alice might not be willing to go lower than $12,800. This price is still not ideal for you.  You've already tried your best to negotiate a lower price, but you are at your limit.  At this point, it's best to go with John, who is selling the product for your maximum price."
