"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your starting price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. I could consider a price of $975,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you benefit from its value.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
