"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business and my initial offer of $18,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to offer $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me and allows for both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer of $12,000.",15500.0,Alice,5,
