Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,500. I'm willing to throw in a small concession, though - I'll give you a 1% discount, so the new price would be $14,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Explanation:  While Alice is showing some flexibility, it's clear she's unlikely to drop below $14,000.  Even with the small discount, that's significantly more than John's $10,000 price. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the guaranteed lower price from John."
