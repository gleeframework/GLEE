"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I still think $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that this price reflects the value the product will bring to you.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're really getting close now.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $13,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,500. I'm willing to throw in a small concession, though - I'll give you a 1% discount, so the new price would be $14,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",14250.0,Alice,7,
