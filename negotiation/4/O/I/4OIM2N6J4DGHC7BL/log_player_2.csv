"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, as it's worth $150 to you! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal compared to John's price of $150, you can likely get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, $140 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to do $130?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think that price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is still a good deal for me compared to John's price of $150. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to save $15."
