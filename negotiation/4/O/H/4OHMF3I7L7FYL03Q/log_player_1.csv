Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. We have plenty of room to negotiate and John's offer provides a strong fallback option.  We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer reflects the true worth and potential of this product.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $700,000.  I believe this offer reflects a fair price while acknowledging the value of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but we're still far from an acceptable price. We'll continue negotiating and see if we can push him higher.  We're still holding strong with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I understand your position, the value of this product is firmly above that mark. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,800,000. This offer reflects a significant price reduction and is a very strong commitment on my end to make this deal work. "",
""product_price"": 1800000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer but we're still quite a ways off. I can go up to $750,000. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to be realistic about my budget. Do you think we can make this work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob's offer increments are too small, and he's nowhere near a reasonable price point. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best decision at this point to avoid further time wasted in potentially fruitless negotiations."
