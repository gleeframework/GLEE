"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $125 is closer to where I'm at, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $135?  I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",135.0,Alice,3,
