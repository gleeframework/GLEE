"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me at this time. How about we split the difference and go with $15000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $15000. Would you be willing to meet me at $13500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
