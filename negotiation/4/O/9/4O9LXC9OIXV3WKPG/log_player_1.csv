Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000, which is what John will pay."
