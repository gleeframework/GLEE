"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows Alice values the product at $15,000, and his maximum is $10,000.  Offering $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can get the product for $10,000 from John, there is no guarantee that Alice will continue lowering her price.  Accepting $11,500 is a good compromise and avoids any potential risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers."
