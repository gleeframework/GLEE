"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still above my minimum threshold and closer to my desired price than John's offer.  It's time to close the deal."
