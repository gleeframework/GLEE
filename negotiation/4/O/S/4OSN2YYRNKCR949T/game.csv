"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $100. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 seems a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $100. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $105 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $90? That's a fair compromise, I think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $95. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $100. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
