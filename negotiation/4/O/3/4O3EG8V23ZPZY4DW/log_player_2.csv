"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still possible to do better. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a lower price while leaving room for negotiation. A $50,000 reduction from Alice's offer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still showing respect for her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $920,000, which is only $20,000 higher than Bob's counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,000,000. It's worth accepting the offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially having to pay more if Alice raises her price again."
