"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $100 to Bob, and I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $100. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer of $90 but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can get him to agree to a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $100. This is my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John for $100, which is fine, but I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible."
