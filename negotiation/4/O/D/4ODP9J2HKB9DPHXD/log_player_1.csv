Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

I'll aim a bit lower but still above my minimum."

Bob is clearly very interested and meeting halfway is a good compromise. This secures a profit above my alternative option."
