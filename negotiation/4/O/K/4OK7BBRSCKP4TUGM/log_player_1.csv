Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth $200, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $180."", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives you room to negotiate. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  While the $180 offer is high, it's not ridiculously above Bob's perceived value ($80). This might prevent him from immediately disengaging. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $150. This knowledge gives you leverage and confidence in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $180. However, that's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below your minimum ($150) and even further from your initial asking price. Accepting would be a considerable loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, the fact that Bob made a counteroffer suggests he's interested and potentially willing to negotiate further. 
* **Backup Plan:** You still have the security of selling to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob completely stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $160. It's a fair offer for a product of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:**  While not accepting Bob's low offer, you've made a substantial reduction from $180 to $160, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justifying the Price:**  Highlighting the product's ""true value"" aims to nudge Bob away from his low valuation and creates a basis for a higher price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is still comfortably above your minimum ($150) and keeps you in a strong position. You're balancing firmness with flexibility to encourage Bob towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you think the product is worth more, but $160 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I'm willing to buy it from you directly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer has only increased to $120, which is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Slow Progress:** The negotiation is progressing very slowly. Bob's counteroffers are increasing in small increments, suggesting it's unlikely he'll reach your minimum acceptable price soon. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $150. Accepting this offer avoids further haggling with Bob and ensures you get a fair price for your product.

It's time to cut your losses with Bob and move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
