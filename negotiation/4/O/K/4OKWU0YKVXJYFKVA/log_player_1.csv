Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), but still higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This creates room for negotiation and gives Bob some incentive to accept.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and sets a positive tone. It highlights the value the product offers Bob while also emphasizing that the price is fair. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a slightly lower price, I can potentially entice Bob to accept quickly. However, if he rejects, I can still use John as a fallback option to ensure I don't sell below my minimum.  Further negotiation will depend on Bob's counteroffer and my desire to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to close a deal quickly, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will use this opportunity to send a counteroffer closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us. If Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway, I can always sell to John and secure a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too far below my asking price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000, which is halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($950,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is again friendly and focused on finding a mutually beneficial solution. I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer while emphasizing that a higher price is necessary for me. I also highlight that my new offer is still a good deal for him.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and encourage Bob to accept. By offering a middle ground, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. If Bob rejects again, I'll have a better understanding of his bottom line and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. I think this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $980,000 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer, it still falls short of my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll use this opportunity to send a final counteroffer closer to my minimum price, aiming to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he still rejects, I can confidently sell to John and secure a much better price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $980,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to make one final offer of $1,150,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a final offer of $1,150,000, which is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still lower than my initial offer of $1,100,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still securing a decent profit.
* **Message:** The message is firm yet respectful, acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal but emphasizing the value of the product and my need to achieve a fair price. It also hints at the possibility of selling to John if Bob doesn't accept, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

This final counteroffer aims to push Bob towards accepting a price closer to my desired value. By emphasizing the fairness and finality of the offer, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to reconsider. If he still rejects, I can move forward with selling to John without hesitation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the same price you offered earlier. I think this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has finally met my previous offer of $1,050,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate would likely result in more concessions from my side, ultimately leaving me with a less desirable outcome.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John at $1,200,000 is the best course of action at this point.  It guarantees I reach my minimum goal, and I can avoid further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiation with Bob."
