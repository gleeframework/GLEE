Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too far below my asking price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $980,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to make one final offer of $1,150,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.
