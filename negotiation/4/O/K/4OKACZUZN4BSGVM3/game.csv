"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a bit less. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? That's the absolute maximum I can offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
