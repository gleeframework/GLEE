"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $10,500.  This is a fair price that respects both of our needs. Let's work together to find a solution.",10500.0,Bob,4,
