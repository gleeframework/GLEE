"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? It's a great deal for a product you'll find incredibly valuable.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
