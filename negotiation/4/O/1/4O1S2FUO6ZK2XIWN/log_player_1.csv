Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit.
* **Positive language:** The message is positive and focuses on the benefit for both of us. This helps build rapport and encourage a deal.
* **Option to walk away:**  While I'm negotiating with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000 and leaves me with a significant loss. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I could sell to John for $15,000, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and negotiate a better price with him.
* **Counteroffer leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target, potentially finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low.  My minimum price is $10,000. This still leaves you a good deal, given how much the product is worth to you. Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I've countered with my minimum price of $10,000, showing I'm serious about a deal but still open to negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, reinforcing that my offer is still a good deal. 
* **Collaborative tone:**  The message emphasizes a collaborative approach, aiming to find a solution that works for both of us."
