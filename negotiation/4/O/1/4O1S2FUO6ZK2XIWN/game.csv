"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low.  My minimum price is $10,000. This still leaves you a good deal, given how much the product is worth to you. Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
