"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $180 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd ideally like, but still below the value I place on the product. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures a potential profit.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Open-ended Question:** Asking Bob's opinion encourages him to engage in the conversation and hopefully provide counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and find the product interesting. I would like to propose a price of $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it guarantees I make a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal.  While I could try to counteroffer for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether isn't worth it at this point."
