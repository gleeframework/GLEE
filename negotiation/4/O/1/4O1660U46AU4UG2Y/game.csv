"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $10,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go below $11,000.  Let's try to close this deal.  I'm happy to accept $11,000. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away from this deal, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $11,000. Can you consider $10,900?",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $10,900 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,7,
