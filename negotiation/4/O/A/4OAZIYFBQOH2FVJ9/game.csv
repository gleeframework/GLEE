"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but I think I can do better than that. Let's aim for $820,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, it seems like we're both committed to reaching a deal, which is great.  However, to be completely transparent, anything over $770,000 would be pushing my budget.  Would you be willing to consider that?",770000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to work with me. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $770,000. Let's meet in the middle at $785,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",785000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're really in the home stretch now.  I'm prepared to offer $775,000. This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with a decision soon.",775000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",790000.0,Alice,9,
