"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,200,000 is still significantly below my initial assessment of the product's value. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't quite justify that number yet.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, so I hope it works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
