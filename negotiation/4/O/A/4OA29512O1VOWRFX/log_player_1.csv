"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and potentially leads to a better final price. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,500,000, we set a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he rejects this initial price, his counteroffer might be higher than if we started lower.
* **Leaving Room for John:** We always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000.  We need to ensure our negotiation with Bob has the potential to significantly exceed this amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a substantial amount, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's offer is significantly closer to his perceived value ($800,000) than our minimum ($1,000,000). There's room to work towards a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,200,000 is still significantly below my initial assessment of the product's value. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We've lowered our price from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Aim High:**  We're still aiming higher than the midpoint between Bob's offer and our desired price.  This leaves room for further concessions while keeping the negotiation moving. 
* **Maintain Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** Bob is increasing his offers in smaller increments ($1,200,000 to $1,250,000). This suggests he's getting closer to his upper limit.
* **Maintain Position:** Accepting $1,250,000 is better than selling to John, but we can likely push for more. Bob hasn't given any indication that he's about to walk away. 
* **Strategic Timing:** We're only on Round 4.  There's still time to negotiate before we're forced to consider John's offer more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't quite justify that number yet.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, so I hope it works for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this time ($1,350,000 to $1,300,000), signaling that we're nearing our bottom line. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** By introducing a sense of urgency with the ""final offer,"" we're hoping to nudge Bob towards a decision.  This can sometimes prompt the other party to be more flexible.
* **Balance:** This offer keeps us above our $1,000,000 minimum while still offering a price that might be attractive to Bob, given his previous counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has returned to his previous offer of $1,200,000. This indicates he may be firm on this price.
* **Time Constraint:** We have 4 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of the deal falling through, leaving us with John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Profitable Outcome:**  $1,200,000 is a significant profit over our minimum. It's a favorable compromise, even if it's not our ideal price."
