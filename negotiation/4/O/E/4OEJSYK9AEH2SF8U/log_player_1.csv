Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $11,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $10,500 is a good price, considering my minimum is $10,000.  There's always a risk of further negotiations going down, and I'm happy with this deal."
