"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we discuss the price further?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $14000, which is still a great value for the product's quality and features. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the market value and the product's features.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $14000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $13500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere, so I'd like to try to meet you in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,6,
