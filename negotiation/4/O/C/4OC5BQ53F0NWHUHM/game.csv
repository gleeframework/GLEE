"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go down to $12,500. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
