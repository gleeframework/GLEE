"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. What would you say to an offer of $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as high as $14,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a very fair offer considering its potential value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a new offer of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
