"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $120. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's an excellent investment for you. Would you like to make this purchase today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer is fair, there's no incentive for me to accept it immediately. I know John is willing to sell the product for the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, I open the possibility of her offering a lower price in an attempt to secure the sale.  I lose nothing by rejecting and potentially have something to gain."
