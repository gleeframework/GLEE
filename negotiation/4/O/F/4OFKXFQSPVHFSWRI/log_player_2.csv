Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low of a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $97.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $102.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the $102.50 offer gets you the product at a price significantly lower than John's $120."
