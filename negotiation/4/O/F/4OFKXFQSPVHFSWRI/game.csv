"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low of a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $90, Alice. How about we settle at $97.50?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $97.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $102.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",102.5,Alice,5,
