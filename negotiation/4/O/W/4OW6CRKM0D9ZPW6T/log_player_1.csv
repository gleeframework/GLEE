Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $100 to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  It's a great deal for both of us!  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $60 is far too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $70? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

$70 is still too low for me.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not going to give it away. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  While I'd like to have gotten more from Bob, I've already had several rounds of negotiations and I'm running out of time. John is a sure thing and I'm happy with the price."
