Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's buying price creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** While Bob values the product at $800,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives:
    * High value and potential in the product 
    * A limited-time opportunity
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position. There's no risk of going below the minimum acceptable price."
