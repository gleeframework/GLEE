"Alice, your product is definitely appealing, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to offer you $1,600,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and it's still within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a good return on your investment, but $1,700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,650,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in your product while staying within my budget.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your target price. However, $1,680,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,660,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",1660000.0,Bob,6,
