It's not worth buying from Alice at her initial price.  You can do better.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a lower price, but I'm open to some negotiation.  This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's more than she values the product at.  Let's see if she'll bite."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above what John is offering.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, I'll just go with John's price."
