"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $125 for you, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
