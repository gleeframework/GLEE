"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a very good price, but it's still early in the negotiation.  There's potential to get a better deal.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows for more exploration of Alice's willingness to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's reaction and see how much room there is for negotiation. A price of $250,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $350,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my initial counteroffer.  There is room for further negotiation. I'll reject Alice's offer and continue exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $300,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price than her current offer.  It also allows for a potential middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $325,000 is a reasonable price, especially given the limited time remaining.  Accepting the offer will allow me to secure the product without risking further negotiations and potentially having to buy from John at a much higher price."
