Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe that price is a little high. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see us reaching a deal, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value.  It's worth negotiating further to see if we can get closer to a more reasonable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, $750,000 is still a significant gap from where I see the product's value.
