"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe that price is a little high. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see us reaching a deal, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, $750,000 is still a significant gap from where I see the product's value.  To be fair to both of us, how about we consider $1,150,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close to a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $850,000. I think this reflects a fair value for the product.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
