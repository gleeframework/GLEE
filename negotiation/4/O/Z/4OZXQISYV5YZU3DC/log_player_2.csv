"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim Low, Counter High:** Starting with a low offer (significantly below my actual limit) gives me more room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:** I want to maintain a good relationship with Alice but also signal that I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** I don't want to reveal my maximum budget ($8,000) this early in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, which shows she's willing to negotiate. There's likely still room to get the price closer to my target.
* **John's Price as Leverage:** I have John's $8,000 offer as a backup, so I'm not desperate to accept anything above that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would make this a much easier decision for me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Increase:** I'm gradually increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious while still staying below my maximum budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm subtly implying that my budget is firm and that $7,000 might be my final offer.
* **Maintaining Respect:** I'm continuing to use polite and appreciative language to keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I understand your budget is tight, but $7,000 just isn't workable for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Quite:** Alice is getting very close to John's price, but there's still a $500 difference. It's worth one more try to see if I can get her closer to $8,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** I'm aware that the rounds are ticking down. If Alice doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two, I'll likely go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable to work with, and I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $7,750, and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise by suggesting a price exactly in the middle. This can be a powerful tactic to encourage a deal.
* **Final Offer Implication:** While I'm not explicitly saying it's my final offer, the tone suggests I'm getting close to my limit.
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, I need to push for a final decision from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000.  Let's try $8,250.  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached My Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,250, which is still above my maximum budget and John's offer.
* **No More Wiggle Room:**  Further haggling is unlikely to yield significant results at this point, and I risk Alice becoming less willing to negotiate.
* **Guaranteed Price:**  John's offer of $8,000 is guaranteed, and there's no point in risking losing that price for a small potential saving."
