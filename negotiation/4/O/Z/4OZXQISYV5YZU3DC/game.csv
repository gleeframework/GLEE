"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value this product holds.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would make this a much easier decision for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand your budget is tight, but $7,000 just isn't workable for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable to work with, and I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $7,750, and we have a deal?",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000.  Let's try $8,250.  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. ",8250.0,Alice,7,
