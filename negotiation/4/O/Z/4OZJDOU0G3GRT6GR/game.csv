"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm really hoping to close this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $108?",108.0,Alice,5,
