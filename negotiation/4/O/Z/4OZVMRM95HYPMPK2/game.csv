"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $105? I'm really interested in this product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,108.0
"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate that! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $105. How about we meet at $108, like I suggested earlier? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,,
