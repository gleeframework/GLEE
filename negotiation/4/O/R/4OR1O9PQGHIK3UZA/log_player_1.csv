"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows for several rounds of negotiation before potentially resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. This allows me to control the price and explore a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's, lower than my minimum:** $10,500 is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still securing a decent profit.
* **Positive and persuasive tone:**  I use a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Focus on fairness:** Emphasizing ""fair deal"" for both parties helps Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  I still have room to negotiate further, but am moving towards a more acceptable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable amount. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I need to continue pushing for a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired value.
* **Time is on my side:** We're only in round 4, so there's still time to negotiate further. If Bob doesn't come up in price, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. This price is still a great deal for you considering its value and the savings you'll get compared to buying it elsewhere.  Let's make this happen.  "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm lowering my offer again but making it clear that this is my final price. 
* **Appealing to Bob's logic:**  I highlight the value of the product and potential savings compared to other options. This appeals to Bob's rational side and encourages him to see the value in accepting the offer.
* **Sense of urgency:**  I use phrases like ""final offer"" and ""let's make this happen"" to subtly push Bob towards a decision.
* **Maintaining control:** I'm still in control of the negotiation but making a concession to keep the deal moving forward."
