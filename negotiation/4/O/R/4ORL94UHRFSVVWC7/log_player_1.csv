Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $85.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that he'll immediately reject it.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate, giving me the chance to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $77.50?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 77.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $75. Would you be willing to meet me at $76? That's the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $76. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $76
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $76 is only slightly below my minimum of $80. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal completely."
