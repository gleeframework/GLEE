Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $15,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $14,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is nearing your walk-away price.  While you could try to push for a slightly better deal, there's a risk she'll hold firm or you'll waste valuable time in further negotiation. Taking the $14,750 offer secures you a reasonable discount."
