Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. I'm sure you'll find it to be a fantastic deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This allows room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the value he might gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open invitation for Bob to respond, ensuring the negotiation can continue.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and either accept it or make a new counteroffer depending on his proposed price. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'll keep John in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall or break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $10000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Room for Profit:** I'm not going to get any higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to more time wasted, and I have the option of selling to John for the same price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and easy sale without jeopardizing my minimum earnings."
