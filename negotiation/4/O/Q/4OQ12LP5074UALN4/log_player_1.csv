"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm framing the offer in terms of the value the product holds for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm leaving room for potential counteroffers, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation process.

**Important Note:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John open, as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Strategic Play:**  By rejecting, I demonstrate my commitment to a higher price, potentially pressuring Bob to increase his offer.

**Important Note:**  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm taking a calculated risk to see if I can potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher. How about $1,375,000? It's still a great price considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly pressuring him to consider a higher price.
* **Building Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and allows for further rounds of bargaining.

**Important Note:** I'm still keeping the option to sell to John in mind, but I'm committed to pushing for the best possible price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal. I am willing to pay $1,360,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Pushing for a Better Deal:** I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm confident that I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially push him closer to my desired price in the next round. 
* **Risk-Reward:** The potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk of Bob walking away or me selling to John at a lower price.

**Important Note:** I'm aware that I have a limited number of rounds, but I'm willing to take the calculated risk to see if I can secure a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to stick to a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,365,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 1365000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession to show I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a strong position. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm again highlighting the product's value to remind Bob why this price is fair.
* **Last Stand:** This is likely my last counteroffer before considering the option of selling to John. 

**Important Note:** I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hopeful that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some more thought, and I'm willing to pay $1,362,500 for your product. I hope this price aligns better with your expectations while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,362,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,362,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a strong possibility that Bob will walk away, or I might have to settle for John's offer, which is lower than my desired outcome.

**Important Note:**  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, accepting this offer secures a deal that's still financially favorable for me and minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
