"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  That's a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's fair considering the value of this product.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $12500. This is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it.",12500.0,Bob,4,
