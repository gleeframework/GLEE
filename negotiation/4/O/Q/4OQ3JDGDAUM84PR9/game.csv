"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,650?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10650.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250, but that's my final offer. It's still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,250, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500, so how about we try $10,000? I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd love to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
