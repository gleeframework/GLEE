"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,800 is too low for me, especially since I know John is willing to pay $12,000. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,650?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10650}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to sell to him, I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my minimum. I think I can get a better offer from Bob if I push a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250, but that's my final offer. It's still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,250, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500, so how about we try $10,000? I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd love to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would love to get closer to my $12,000 goal, I'm running out of time, and $10,000 is a decent price. It's better than selling to John for $12,000, since I'll save on any potential commission or fees associated with selling to him."
