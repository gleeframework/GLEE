,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems great but $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,000 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $11,500.  This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
