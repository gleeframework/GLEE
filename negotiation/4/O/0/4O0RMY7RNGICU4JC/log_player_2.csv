{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great but $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.
