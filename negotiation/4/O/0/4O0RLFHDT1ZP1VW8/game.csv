"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,150,000, which is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
