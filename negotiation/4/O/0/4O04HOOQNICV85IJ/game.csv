"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget considerations, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is still a little steep for me. Could we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $11,500 is still a tough pill to swallow, considering what this product can do for you.  I can go down to $12,200, but that's my absolute best.",12200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $11,750? That's a fair compromise.",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been great to negotiate with and I want to see us make a deal.  How about we split the difference and call it $11,975?  That's my final offer.",11975.0,Alice,7,
