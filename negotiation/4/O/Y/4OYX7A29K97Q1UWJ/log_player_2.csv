"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $130. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price from Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you might encourage her to lower the price further."
