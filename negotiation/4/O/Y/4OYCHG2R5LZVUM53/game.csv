"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for something worth at least $15,000 to me. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth around $10,000 to me, so I could consider something closer to that range. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  I understand this product has a specific value to you, but it's worth at least $15,000 to me. To find common ground, I'm willing to go down to $14,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very useful. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. I hope this shows you I'm serious about buying, and I believe this price is a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a little far off from my desired price. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to move up a little more and offer you $12,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product to me.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I've considered your position, and to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it would be a fair outcome for everyone. This is my final offer, as I want to conclude this negotiation and move forward.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,7,
