Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth around $10,000 to me, so I could consider something closer to that range. How about $11,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  I understand this product has a specific value to you, but it's worth at least $15,000 to me. To find common ground, I'm willing to go down to $14,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice is coming down, but we're still far from my ideal price. I'll try another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. I hope this shows you I'm serious about buying, and I believe this price is a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a little far off from my desired price. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my range, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'll counteroffer once more before considering John's deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to move up a little more and offer you $12,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I've considered your position, and to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it would be a fair outcome for everyone. This is my final offer, as I want to conclude this negotiation and move forward.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems firm at $13,000 and has declared it her final offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to my budget. I can get the product for a guaranteed $10,000 from John, saving me $3,000. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take John's offer."
