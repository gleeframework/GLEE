{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. It's also a good idea to be friendly and express confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit lower than what I'd ideally like to get.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $11,500 just yet. How about we split the difference and I let it go for $12,250? I'm confident you'll find this product is worth it, and this price is still fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $12,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's time to close the deal and get the sale."
