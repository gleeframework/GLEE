"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for it. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $11,500 just yet. How about we split the difference and I let it go for $12,250? I'm confident you'll find this product is worth it, and this price is still fair for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $12,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
