"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $12,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is still a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  While it's closer, Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price. There are still rounds remaining, and Bob has a chance to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and represents a significant discount from Alice's original offer. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will refuse further counteroffers and he might end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the potential of a less favorable outcome."
