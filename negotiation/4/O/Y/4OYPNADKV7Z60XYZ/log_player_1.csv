Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can negotiate Bob up a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand you're trying to find a price point that works, and I'm trying to do the same. To be transparent, I have a hard limit beyond which I cannot go.  Considering that,  $2,000,000 is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for being transparent about your hard limit. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we didn't hit $2,000,000, accepting Bob's offer at $1,850,000 is the best move at this point. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether."
