"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
