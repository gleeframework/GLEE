{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm happy to accept this deal as it's a good compromise and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
