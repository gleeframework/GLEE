Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob seems firm on his $9,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. It's time to take John's guaranteed $12,000."
