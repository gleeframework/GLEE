Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000.

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to switch tactics. Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and you have a guaranteed option at $800,000 with John. There's no point in risking further negotiation."
