Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation but higher than her minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't need to go below her minimum.

By offering the product at $140, Alice creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. Bob gets a product he values at a price lower than his perceived value, and Alice maximizes her profit. If Bob rejects, Alice doesn't lose out."
