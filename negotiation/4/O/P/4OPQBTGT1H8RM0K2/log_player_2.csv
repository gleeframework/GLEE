"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm asking for $14,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value. However,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, showing he's serious about getting a good deal. This $12,000 offer is still a $2,000 profit for Alice, so it's not unreasonable.
* **Justification:**  Bob acknowledges Alice's points about the product's value but reinforces his desire for a lower price. This keeps the negotiation friendly while establishing Bob's position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident that this product is worth more than that, especially considering the potential return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the best possible price. While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer.  By rejecting, Bob maintains leverage and signals his willingness to continue negotiating for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me at this point. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that I can make good use of this product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob offers a middle ground, showing willingness to negotiate. This keeps the conversation constructive and avoids a stalemate.
