Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below my minimum ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting me closer to my desired profit. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150."
