Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. Based on my research and understanding of the product's value, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my initial counteroffer. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $800,000.

I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $850,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing from John.

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet the minimum price. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to continue haggling with Bob and risk getting even less."
