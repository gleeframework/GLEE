"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$950,000 is a good price, but it's still early in the negotiation. There's room for Alice to come down further, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to be a bit more cautious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 15% discount from Alice's initial price. This will test Alice's willingness to negotiate and give us some room to settle at a fair price. I want to gauge how strongly Alice wants to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is still a better price than buying from John, I believe I can get a better deal. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, so I have time to explore more options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $850,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  I'm hoping this signals my seriousness about buying the product while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I might be able to get a slightly lower price, I'm now in the danger zone of running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's within my budget and significantly better than John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
