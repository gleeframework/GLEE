"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $1000000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  To compromise, I'm willing to drop the price to $1250000.  This still reflects the potential and benefits it offers, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Please let me know if you're open to this offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I still feel that we are quite far apart. I am willing to increase my offer to $1100000. I hope this proposal is closer to what you consider fair.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
