"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",12800.0,Alice,5,
