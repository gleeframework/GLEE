"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $13500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I really need to stay within my budget.",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12800 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $13200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
