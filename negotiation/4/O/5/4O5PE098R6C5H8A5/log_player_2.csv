"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you can leverage for significant gains. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000, a price that allows you to profit handsomely while still leaving room for negotiation. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000.
* **You save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though Alice might be willing to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price. It's better to secure the product at a price that's still beneficial to you."
