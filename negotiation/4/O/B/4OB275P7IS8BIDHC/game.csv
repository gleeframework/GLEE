I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a steal! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. What do you think?,1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However,  $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1000000?  I'm genuinely interested, and I believe this could be a win-win situation for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you see the potential for a win-win situation. However, I've received interest from another buyer, and I need to balance that against our conversation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now willing to sell the product for $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another offer. However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose $1050000 as a final offer.  This represents a significant reduction from your initial asking price and is the highest I can go at this time. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now willing to sell the product for $1080000. I'm starting to feel a bit more confident that we can close this deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What are your thoughts?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
