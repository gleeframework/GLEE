I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob $13,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to my initial offer.  I hope this will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to go lower. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  John is a safe bet at $12,000, which is my minimum value."
