"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $10200?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $9500. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. How about we meet at $10000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
