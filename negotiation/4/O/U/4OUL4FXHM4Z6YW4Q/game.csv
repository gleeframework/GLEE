"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for an item of this caliber.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than I can accept.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we settle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you believe the product offers exceptional value, but I still think $1,100,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,175,000. Can we discuss this price?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $1,175,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair and reasonable price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
