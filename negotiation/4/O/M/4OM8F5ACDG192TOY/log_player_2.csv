Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and drop my price to $1,050,000.
