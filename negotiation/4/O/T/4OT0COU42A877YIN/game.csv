"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to get at least $16,500 for it. Let's meet in the middle, how about we split the difference and do $16,750?  It's a great deal for both of us.",16750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to pay $16,000. That's a good compromise, and it's still within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
