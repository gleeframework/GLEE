Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to get at least $16,500 for it. Let's meet in the middle, how about we split the difference and do $16,750?  It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to pay $16,000. That's a good compromise, and it's still within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $16,000 is close enough to my target and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so this is a good outcome."
