"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground. ",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $890,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it would be a great outcome for both sides. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
