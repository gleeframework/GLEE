"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a lower price by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still a chance to negotiate a lower price.  He can try a counteroffer again to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $890,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it would be a great outcome for both sides. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice has come down considerably.  $890,000 is a good price for Bob, as it's significantly less than his fallback option of $1,000,000 from John. There's a good chance Alice won't come down any further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price while leaving room for Alice to make a profit."
