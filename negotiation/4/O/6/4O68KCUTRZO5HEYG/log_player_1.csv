Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still closer to my desired price than his offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal without needing to involve John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, this offer is not worth continuing the negotiation. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
