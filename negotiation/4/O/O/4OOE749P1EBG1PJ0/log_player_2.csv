"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is way above my budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15,000 is out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but $13,000 is still over my budget.  I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial offer but not that high. I have 7 rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. I'm still only able to offer $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,000, which is $12,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $12,000, it's still above my budget of $10,000. With only 5 rounds left, the chances of reaching a price I'm comfortable with are getting slim.  It's better to cut my losses and buy from John for $10,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me further negotiation time."
