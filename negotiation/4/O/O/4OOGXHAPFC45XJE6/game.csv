"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I could meet you at $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $700,000. I'd like to make one more concession to try to reach a deal.
