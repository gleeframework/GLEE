"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $825000?",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $825000, so I'm counteroffering at $862500. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us.",862500.0,Alice,3,
