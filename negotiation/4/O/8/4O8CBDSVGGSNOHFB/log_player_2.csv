Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $72 is still a bit higher than my target.  How about $71? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 71}
```

**Reasoning:**

By offering $71, you're showing that you're serious about getting a good price.  It's only a small decrease from Alice's offer, which might make her more likely to accept. You're also reminding her of the ""fair"" aspect of the deal, which could sway her opinion."
