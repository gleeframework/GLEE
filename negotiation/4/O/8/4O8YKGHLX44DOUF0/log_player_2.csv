"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still more than the product is worth to him ($8,000), so it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  He can reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for some profit for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $9,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $9,200 is still above what Bob is willing to pay.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  There's still room for a compromise, so it's worth trying to negotiate further. 
* **Avoiding John's price:** Buying from John at $12,000 is the absolute last resort.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm counteroffering at $9,100. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  $9,100 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $8,750. 
* **Negotiation is moving closer:** Alice is showing some willingness to budge, which is encouraging.
* **Potential for compromise:**  There's still room for a compromise, so it's worth continuing the negotiation.  

Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're coming down in price, and I appreciate that. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm counteroffering at $9,050. I believe this price is still a fair compromise, considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** Alice is getting closer to Bob's target, but $9,050 is still a bit too high. 
* **Time to push:**  With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to push for a better price.
* **Avoid John's price:**  It's still more beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice than to buy from John.

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try one more time to get a price closer to $8,900."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,050 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to meet you at $8,950. This is the best I can do, and it's still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this out before we both have to go to Plan B."", ""product_price"": 8950}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm counteroffering at $9,075. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,075. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,075
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One round left:** This is the final round of negotiation.
* **No room for compromise:**  Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.
* **Risk of a worse deal:** If Bob rejects Alice's offer and tries to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and he might end up with no deal at all.

While buying from John at $12,000 is not ideal, it's the safest option to ensure Bob gets the product. It's better to pay a slightly higher price than to risk getting nothing at all in the final round."
