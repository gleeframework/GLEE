"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm interested in this product and believe it has value, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my best price, but I'm open to discussing further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your initial offer. I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  I believe this offer gives us both a chance to make this deal work.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer you the product at a price of $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth and your initial offer. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
