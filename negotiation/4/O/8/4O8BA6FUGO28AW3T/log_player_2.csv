"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're only willing to pay up to $800,000.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.** This gives you the opportunity to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** You can still choose to buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm interested in this product and believe it has value, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my best price, but I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your initial offer. I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget.
* **Rejecting the offer gives you leverage.**  It allows you to continue negotiations and potentially push for a price closer to your target.
* **Buying from John remains a viable option.** You can always choose John if you can't reach a better agreement with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  I believe this offer gives us both a chance to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer you the product at a price of $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth and your initial offer. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **The negotiation is getting close to your limit.** You've already rejected multiple offers, and there's a risk of reaching a point where Alice won't budge further.
* **John offers a guaranteed price.** Buying from John ensures you get the product at your desired price point without further negotiation.  

It's better to secure the product at your maximum budget now rather than risk a prolonged negotiation that might not result in a better deal."
