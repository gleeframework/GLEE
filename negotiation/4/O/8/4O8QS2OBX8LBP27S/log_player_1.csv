Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice. While $825,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like. How about we settle around $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.
