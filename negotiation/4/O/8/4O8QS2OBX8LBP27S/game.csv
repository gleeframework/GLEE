"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice. While $825,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like. How about we settle around $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $800,000.
