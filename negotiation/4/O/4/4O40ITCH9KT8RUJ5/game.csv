"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,200 is still a little out of my budget right now. I'm really hoping we can reach a deal, and I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This would allow me to purchase the product and still stay within my limits. Would you be open to considering this offer?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,300. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",9300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $9,300 is still a bit higher than what I can manage right now.  I'm really trying to make this work, and I'm willing to go to $8,800. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'd be very happy to finalize the purchase. What do you think?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,800 is getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to give up. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,100. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm truly interested in this product and I'm feeling confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,900? This would be a great deal for you, as it's just $100 away from your last offer, and it would allow me to purchase the product comfortably. Let's work together to make this happen!",8900.0,Bob,8,
