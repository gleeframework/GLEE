"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice's offer is exactly at that price, there is no benefit to rejecting the offer. Even if Bob counteroffers, he can't get a lower price, and the risk is that Alice will reject his counteroffer. Buying from John also results in the same price. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
