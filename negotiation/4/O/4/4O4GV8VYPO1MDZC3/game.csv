"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has value, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider a price of $875,000. This takes into account its worth to both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  That's moving in the right direction. To be frank, I'm working with a pretty tight budget on this purchase.  Could we settle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of what I'm offering.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",825000.0,Alice,5,
