"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has value, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000."", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's strategic to begin negotiations significantly below my actual maximum price. This allows room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Leaving Alice Room:** While my initial offer is low, it's not offensively so. It gives Alice space to counter and hopefully meet somewhere closer to the middle.
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback.  If negotiations with Alice don't progress favorably, I have a viable alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider a price of $875,000. This takes into account its worth to both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice lowered her price substantially, which suggests she's willing to negotiate.
* **Still Room:** The new offer is still above my maximum budget. There's space for further negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** While I haven't used it explicitly, the presence of John's offer gives me leverage. Alice doesn't want to lose the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  That's moving in the right direction. To be frank, I'm working with a pretty tight budget on this purchase.  Could we settle at $760,000?"", ""product_price"": 760000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer is roughly halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Direct and Honest:**  I'm being upfront about budget constraints. While not revealing my absolute maximum, it reinforces my need for a lower price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm still aiming for a price that saves me a significant amount compared to John's offer, keeping the negotiation interesting for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of what I'm offering.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her best offer, signaling she's unlikely to move much further.
* **Marginal Savings:** While $825,000 is a decent price, it only saves me $25,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has a high risk of impasse. Alice might walk away, leaving me with no deal. John's offer is a safe and acceptable alternative."
