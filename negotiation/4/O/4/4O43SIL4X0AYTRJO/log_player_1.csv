Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we have a strong alternative buyer (John). This allows us to start with a strong offer closer to our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers, justifying the high price without revealing specific numbers.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""limited-time offer"" and ""exclusive opportunity"" create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a (small) incentive to accept the offer rather than risk losing the opportunity."
