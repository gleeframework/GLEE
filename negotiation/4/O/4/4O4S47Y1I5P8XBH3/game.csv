"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to reconsider purchasing the product from John for $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
