"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However,  $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $9,200. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,200 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $8,800? It's a fair price for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,800 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $9,100. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",9100.0,Alice,5,
