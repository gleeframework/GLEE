Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000, leaving me some wiggle room if Bob makes a counteroffer.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I will be ready to walk away and sell to John if I feel the negotiation is not going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's not a good deal for me. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,000. This is still a fair bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price, but leaves me some room to lower it slightly if needed. If Bob rejects this, I'll be ready to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While $11,000 is closer, it's not a good deal for me.  Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to him."
