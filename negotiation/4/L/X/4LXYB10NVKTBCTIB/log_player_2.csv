"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and features, I believe it's worth more than what others have paid. However, I understand value perception varies. Considering its worth to me and the market, I propose a price of $95. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll choose option 2, ""RejectOffer"". The product is worth $100 to Alice, so it's likely she's making a profit by selling it to me at $95. Since I can buy the product from John for $80, which is a better deal for me, I'll reject Alice's offer and buy it from John instead.
