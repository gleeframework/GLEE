"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given its value to you, I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 would be more reasonable. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a significant undervaluation of what this product brings to the table.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering we both want to reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
