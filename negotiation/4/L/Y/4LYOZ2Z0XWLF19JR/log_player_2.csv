"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice's offer is $130.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price.  
* **John's offer is your safety net:** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can still buy the product for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  I'm offering $115, which is closer to my target price of $120 but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Don't go too low too soon:**  A drastic reduction might make Alice less willing to negotiate.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:** I'm still prepared to buy from John if this deal doesn't work out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While closer to my target, it's still $5 more than what I'm willing to pay.
* **We're nearing my limit:**  I only have 7 rounds left, so I need to be strategic. 
* **John's offer is still a viable option:**  I'm not desperate and can walk away if this deal doesn't improve.

**Next Round:**  I'll likely offer $120 to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my maximum price. Any lower, and it's no longer worthwhile to negotiate with Alice.
* **Time is ticking:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to push for a deal.
* **John's offer is my fallback:** If Alice rejects this, I can confidently buy from John."
