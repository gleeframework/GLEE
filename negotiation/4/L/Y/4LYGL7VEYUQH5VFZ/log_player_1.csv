{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that you think Bob would value the product highly, which could encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below your minimum.  You should reject it and make a counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is above your minimum of $100 and is a good compromise.  It's a better deal than selling to John for $100."
