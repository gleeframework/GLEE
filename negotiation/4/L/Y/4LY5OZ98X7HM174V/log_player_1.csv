"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this will encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to sell the product for my minimum price, I believe I can still do better. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving some room for further negotiation. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 below my initial asking price.  I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's significantly higher than my minimum and secures a quick sale.  I'm also aware that I'm running out of rounds and the risk of ending up with only John's offer, which is my minimum, is increasing."
