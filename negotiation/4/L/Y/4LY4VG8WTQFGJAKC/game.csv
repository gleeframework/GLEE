Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, considering its unique qualities. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is within my budget and still reflects the value of this unique product. This feels like a fair deal that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I believe it's still a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
