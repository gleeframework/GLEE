"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot to you. Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range considering my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob in my message. 

I want to see if I can get closer to my target price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a more reasonable price. How about $12,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it's a good starting point for further negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintaining bargaining power:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm firm on my value and willing to continue the negotiation. 

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a compromise closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,500?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial price but still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive, making the counteroffer seem more appealing.
* **Seeking common ground:** I'm explicitly indicating a willingness to find a compromise, which could encourage Bob to reciprocate. 

By striking a balance between firmness and flexibility, I aim to get closer to my target price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the value of the product to me, I think $14,000 would be a fair price. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Limited time:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John's offer:** While I can sell to John for $15,000, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's almost at my target price and minimizes the risk of not closing the deal."
