"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $8,500 to make this work.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that be agreeable to you?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm feeling flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
