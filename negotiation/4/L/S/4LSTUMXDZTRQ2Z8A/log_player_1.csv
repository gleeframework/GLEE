Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it represents excellent value, and this is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to her product's value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't go lower than this.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""one-time offer"" aims to encourage Bob to accept without trying to haggle too much. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's true valuation of the product. If she knew he valued it at $8,000, she could tailor her approach differently."
