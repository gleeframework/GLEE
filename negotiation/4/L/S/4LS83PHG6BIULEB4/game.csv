"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? This price is still well within the value you've placed on the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",12500.0,Alice,3,
