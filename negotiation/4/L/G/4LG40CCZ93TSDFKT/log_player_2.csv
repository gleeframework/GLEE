"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for this item. I understand its worth to you is $100, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or making a purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is less than your maximum of $100, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer, getting you a better deal."
