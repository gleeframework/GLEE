Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming high and hoping for a good counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still hoping for a better deal than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm comfortable with this offer as it's higher than what I could get from John and it saves time and effort by concluding the negotiation."
