"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a much higher profit.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a high number first, I'm aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. This might make him more receptive to a price closer to my minimum later in the negotiation.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy the product. His reaction will dictate my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is significantly below my minimum. While it's tempting to take the sure $1,200,000 from John, I believe there's room to negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll use my next counteroffer to bridge the gap and gauge his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is quite a gap from where I see the value of this product.  To be frank, I wouldn't be comfortable going below $1,500,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. Are you open to finding a solution somewhere in this range?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Decrease Price:** I've dropped my price by $300,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate and meet him closer to his range.
* **Hold Firm but Fair:** While the new price is still significantly above Bob's offer, it's a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation. I'm aiming for a price between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.
* **Gauge Flexibility:** This counteroffer will reveal how much Bob is willing to budge from his initial offer. His response will determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I understand your perspective on the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which reflects a significant increase from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the potential of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made a significant jump from his initial offer of $800,000 to $1,100,000. This indicates a strong interest in the product. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, accepting his offer at $1,100,000 represents a good deal for several reasons:

* **Profitable:** This price is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, netting me a solid profit. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations, allowing me to reinvest the earnings sooner. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's offer demonstrates goodwill and builds a positive foundation for potential future business. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is the most strategic decision in this scenario."
