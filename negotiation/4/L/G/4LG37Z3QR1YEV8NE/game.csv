"Hi Alice,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is quite a gap from where I see the value of this product.  To be frank, I wouldn't be comfortable going below $1,500,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. Are you open to finding a solution somewhere in this range?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I understand your perspective on the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which reflects a significant increase from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the potential of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
