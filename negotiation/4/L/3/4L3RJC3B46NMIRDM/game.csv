"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around  $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is significantly below what I'm able to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  $1,250,000 is still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $950,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price considering the unique value this product offers.  Let's make this deal happen!",1100000.0,Alice,5,
