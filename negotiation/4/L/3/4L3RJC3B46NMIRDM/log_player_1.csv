"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and confident tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By offering $1,750,000, I leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth negotiating further. I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiation stalls or becomes unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around  $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer shows he's interested, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. It's unlikely I'll get $1,750,000, but I can aim for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Avoiding John's Deal:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit, I want to explore further negotiation with Bob.  The potential for a higher price with Bob still exists. 

**Next Steps:** I will send Bob a counteroffer that's higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is significantly below what I'm able to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer of $1,750,000.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating that the product is still a good deal for Bob even at the counteroffered price.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 to ensure I still make a decent profit. 

**Next Steps:** I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth negotiating further. I'll also continue to keep in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiation stalls or becomes unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  $1,250,000 is still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $950,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $1,500,000 minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm not desperate to sell, and there's still room for negotiation. We're getting closer, so continuing the negotiation might yield a better result.
* **John's Deal as a Backstop:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $1,500,000, which provides a safety net. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's higher than his but lower than my previous offer. This will continue to show my willingness to negotiate while protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price considering the unique value this product offers.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a price that is the midpoint between my previous offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000).
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value proposition of the product, emphasizing its unique features and benefits. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to motivate Bob to accept the offer. 

**Next Steps:** I'll be monitoring Bob's response.  If he rejects, I'll carefully assess his counteroffer, considering how close it is to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and the number of rounds remaining. I will also continue to factor in the option of selling to John if the negotiation stalls or becomes unfavorable."
