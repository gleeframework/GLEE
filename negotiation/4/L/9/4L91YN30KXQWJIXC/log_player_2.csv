Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,500. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,500. At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $12,000.  You've negotiated well, but sometimes the best deals are made by walking away when you have a solid alternative."
