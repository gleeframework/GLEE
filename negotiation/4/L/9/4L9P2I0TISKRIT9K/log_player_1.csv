Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?"", ""product_price"": 13250}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. While $13,250 is better than before, it's still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
**Reasoning:** Bob is now offering $13,000, which is a full $1,000 above your minimum acceptable price and a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might push him away, risking the sure $13,000.  It's better to secure a good profit now than to risk getting less later."
