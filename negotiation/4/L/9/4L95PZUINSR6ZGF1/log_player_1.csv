**Reasoning:**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on it, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept and one that maximizes your profit."
