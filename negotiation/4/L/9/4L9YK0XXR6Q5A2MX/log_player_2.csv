"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** Bob has room to negotiate and potentially save money. 
* **John is a backup option:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob can still secure the product from John, though at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower offer:** Bob starts with a lower offer than Alice's initial price, showing that he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable starting point:** $1,300,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for potential negotiation and a compromise that would be beneficial for both parties.
* **Open communication:**  Bob's message is friendly and encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise, as it's closer to Bob's initial counteroffer and still below his budget.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While accepting the offer, Bob could still try to negotiate a slightly lower price.
* **Time is a factor:**  Bob has limited rounds to close the deal, and accepting this offer allows for a quicker resolution. 
* **John's offer is higher:**  Buying from John would be more expensive, making Alice's offer the more financially attractive option."
