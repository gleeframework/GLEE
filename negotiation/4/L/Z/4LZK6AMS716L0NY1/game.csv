"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $140 to make this worthwhile. How about $145?  This is a great price considering the value you'll get. Let me know what you think!",145.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $130? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
