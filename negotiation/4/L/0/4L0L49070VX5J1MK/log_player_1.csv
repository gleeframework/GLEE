Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $120, so $140 is a price he might consider but will likely push back on. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation without compromising your minimum selling price.
* **It's a clear message:** The message is straightforward and sets the stage for a potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $125?  I'm really interested in the product and think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price of $150.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit to $135.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but my absolute maximum is $130.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150.  I'm confident that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
