{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first."

Round 2

{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  A low counteroffer forces Alice to consider your seriousness and incentivizes her to negotiate.
* **Fair Starting Point:**  $700,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows you to see how flexible Alice is in this early stage of negotiations."
