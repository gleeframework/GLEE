"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's my maximum budget for this product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $10,200? That's the lowest I can go.",10200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $10,450. This is a fair compromise, and I think it will be a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",10450.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",10300.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you. It sounds like we're very close. I'm willing to come down to $10,350. This is my final offer.  Let's close the deal, and you'll have a great product.",10350.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but I'm not comfortable going any higher. Can you meet me at $10,300?",10300.0,Bob,8,
