"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is quite high for my budget. While I appreciate the unique value of this product, I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it.  This is my maximum offer,  I'm ready to move forward with the purchase at this price. ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000.  If you're not willing to accept this price, I will have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
