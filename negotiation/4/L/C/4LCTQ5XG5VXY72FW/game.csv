"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my target.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $10,200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,200 is still a bit above what I can realistically afford right now. How about $10,000?  This is a fair price, and it's the maximum I can pay.  Let's finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $10,050. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get this deal done. What do you think?",10050.0,Alice,7,
