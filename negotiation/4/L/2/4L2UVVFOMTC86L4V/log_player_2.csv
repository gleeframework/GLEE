"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. We are confident it will add significant value to your operations and help you achieve your goals. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, we propose a price of $950,000 for this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I recognize the quality of your product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase for $700,000."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation.  It's significantly lower than Alice's opening price, but still leaves room for us to negotiate upwards towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product and understand your current budget constraints. In light of your offer, we would like to present a counteroffer of $825,000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between our expectations and your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, it's still above our ideal budget.  Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $800,000 is the absolute top of my budget for this. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

We're now pushing firmly towards our fallback price with John.  This puts the pressure on Alice while showing we're serious about buying at the right price."
