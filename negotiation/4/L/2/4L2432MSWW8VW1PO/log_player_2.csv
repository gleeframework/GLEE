"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $11,000.
* **Potential Savings:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Negotiation Risk:**  While Bob could try to negotiate a lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject further offers. This could lead to a stalemate or force Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

Given the significant savings and the risk of a longer negotiation, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision at this point."
