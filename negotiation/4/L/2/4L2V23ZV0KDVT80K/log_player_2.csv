"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's offer to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed to buy from John at a lower cost."
