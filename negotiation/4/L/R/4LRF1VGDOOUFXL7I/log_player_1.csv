**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price point, his offers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that outweighs the guaranteed $1,500,000 John is offering.  It makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob and take the guaranteed profit with John."
