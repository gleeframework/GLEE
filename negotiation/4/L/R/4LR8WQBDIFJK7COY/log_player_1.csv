Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or feel like he's getting a slight deal if he accepts the initial offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so I'm not desperate and can afford to aim high with Bob."
