"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $80.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that my initial price might have been a bit high for you. However, $80 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet somewhere in the middle and settle for $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
