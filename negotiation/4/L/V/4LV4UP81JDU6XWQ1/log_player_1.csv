Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and significantly above my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as reflecting the product's ""worth,"" subtly implying its value might be higher than Bob realizes.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), suggesting a willingness to discuss the price and potentially reach a mutually agreeable deal.

**Why not offer it at $15,000 (John's price)?**

While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, there's a chance Bob might accept a higher price. It's strategically wiser to start higher and potentially negotiate down, rather than limiting my earnings from the beginning."
