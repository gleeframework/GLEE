"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1400000 is a bit high for me.  Considering your value for the product, I'm willing to pay $1200000. This seems like a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I have 8 rounds left and can potentially negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my minimum price.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me more negotiating power and allows me to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This would allow us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
