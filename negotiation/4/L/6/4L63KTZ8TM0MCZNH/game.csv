"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiating, $9000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500? This would allow me to move forward with the sale while still giving you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $10000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. I'm open to discussing this further, but $10000 is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
