Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is more than your $8,000 minimum, meaning you'd still profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is likely to counteroffer, but you've given yourself some room to work with.
* **It's significantly less than Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he's likely to see this as a good deal and be motivated to negotiate. 

This strategy allows you to potentially earn more than the $8,000 from John while still ensuring you don't lose out on a sale."
