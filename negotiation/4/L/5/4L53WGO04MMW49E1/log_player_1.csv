Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and our potential partnership. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
