"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
