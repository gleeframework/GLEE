"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is now offering $1,150,000, which is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **There's potential for further negotiation, but it's risky:** Bob could try to counteroffer again, but there's no guarantee Alice would accept.  There's also a risk that Alice could walk away from the deal altogether.
* **This price is within Bob's budget:** While Bob would ideally like to pay less, $1,150,000 is still within his budget and allows him to acquire the product.  

It's better to secure a good deal with Alice than risk a potential stalemate or having to pay a higher price to John."
