,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $750000 is still a bit below my minimum requirement. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $850000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925000. This is the highest I can go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
