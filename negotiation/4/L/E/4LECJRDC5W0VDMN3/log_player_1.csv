Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's a bit less than what the product is worth to Bob, but still gives me a good profit margin. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept this offer just yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with $130. It's still a bit lower than my ideal price, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid losing the deal altogether.  This price should be attractive to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close enough to my minimum price that I'm willing to accept it. I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a higher price with further negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
