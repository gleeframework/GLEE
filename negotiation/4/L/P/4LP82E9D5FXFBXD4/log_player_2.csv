You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer matches the maximum you're willing to pay, there's no harm in seeing if she might offer a lower price. You can always buy from John later for $120."
