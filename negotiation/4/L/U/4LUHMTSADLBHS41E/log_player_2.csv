"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $25000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $25,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice that he's serious about buying but also has a strict budget. He's offering a price that's 60% lower than her initial offer, which is a big step, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $18000. Is this a more comfortable price for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is a significant decrease from her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $14,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.  Is that something you would be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is continuing to negotiate by making a moderate counteroffer. He's demonstrating that he's willing to compromise but also has a clear price limit. This approach aims to find a middle ground while keeping the pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. Is this a price that you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget of $12,000, even though it's lower than her previous offers. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Bob can get a better deal. There are still a few rounds left to explore options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the negotiation, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is a compromise on my side. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he's still trying to get the price down further. He's increased his offer slightly to show he's willing to compromise, but he's also emphasizing that this is his final offer. This strategy aims to pressure Alice to accept the offer while still being close to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, which is a compromise on my side. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for the value the product offers. Is this something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $16,500 is still higher than Bob's desired budget of $12,000. While there are a few rounds remaining, the negotiation seems to be getting close to a stalemate.  It's likely that Bob will not be able to get the price down to his desired level.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000, as this is the best option within his budget."
