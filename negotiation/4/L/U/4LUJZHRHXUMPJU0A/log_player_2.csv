"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  I'm confident that you'll find this to be a very attractive proposition. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you have a backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down further."
