"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, considering the value and quality of the product, I am unable to reduce the price further. I would like to offer it to you for $14,000, which I believe is still a fair deal given its worth. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. How about $13,500?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider $13,750 as the final offer for the product. I hope this price aligns better with your budget while still allowing me to fairly compensate for the value of the product. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",13750.0,Alice,5,
