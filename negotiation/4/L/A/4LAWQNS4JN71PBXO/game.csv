"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $160? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $140? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? It's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $145. I'm willing to meet you at $142.50. That's the highest I can go.",142.5,Bob,6,
