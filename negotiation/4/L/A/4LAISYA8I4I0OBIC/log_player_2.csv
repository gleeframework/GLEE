```

**Reasoning:**

We're going straight for our maximum budget, as it's likely Alice is trying to get a higher price.  This establishes our price point early and forces Alice to negotiate from there."

```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering the product to you for $12250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. If you can come down to $11,750, I'm ready to close the deal right now. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're emphasizing this is our final offer, adding pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Small Concession:**  By only asking for a small decrease from Alice's last offer, we're showing we're willing to compromise while staying close to our target.
* **Urgency:**  We reiterate our readiness to close the deal, making it clear we're serious about buying.

This strategy aims to encourage Alice to accept our offer, as she might be reluctant to lose the deal at this point, knowing we have the option of going with John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, so I'm offering the product to you for $12000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,000 is still above our budget.  While we have one more round to negotiate, the risk of continuing is high. Alice is showing she is firm on her price, and we could potentially end up losing the deal. 

Buying from John for $10,000 ensures we get the product within our budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
