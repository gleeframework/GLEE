Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9500 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to $12000. Would you be willing to consider $11000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $10250 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to offer a final compromise -  $10750. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and ensures you get a great deal while allowing me to meet my minimum target. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.
