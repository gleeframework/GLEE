"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to start with a price higher than my minimum value ($150) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:** A friendly and positive message can build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay something closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is interested in the product, so there's room for negotiation. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Opportunity cost:** While selling to John for $150 is an option, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  Continuing the negotiation gives me a chance to do that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $135.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable drop:** I'm lowering the price from $175 to $135, showing flexibility but staying above my minimum price.
* **Emphasize willingness to compromise:** I want Bob to understand that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The tone remains positive, encouraging Bob to continue the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and we're getting closer.  
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $150 is still a safe option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm again demonstrating flexibility,  moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Framing as a fair price:**  I'm presenting this offer as a win-win situation, highlighting that it meets both our needs.
* **Encouraging agreement:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion, hoping to get a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  $125 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $120. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 6, and each round further increases the risk of a stalemate.
* **Bob's offer is close, but not enough:**  While $120 is better than previous offers, it's still below my desired price, and I don't want to risk going lower. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a safe and acceptable outcome given the remaining rounds.
* **Avoidance of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price, or a deadlock that results in a missed opportunity.  

It's better to lock in a guaranteed profit now rather than risk a further decline in price or a failed negotiation."
