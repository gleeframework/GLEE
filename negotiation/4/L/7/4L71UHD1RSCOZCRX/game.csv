"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I think this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its value. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be frank, I'm working with a tighter budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? That's a fair deal.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me.  What do you say to $1,300,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end and would allow me to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but I need to see a price that works for both of us. Let's make this happen - I can do $1,250,000, and no lower.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
