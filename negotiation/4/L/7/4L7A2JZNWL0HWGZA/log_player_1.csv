Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference you can negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out.  A good strategy is to:

1. **Start High:** Aim closer to Bob's perceived value.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Don't start at your absolute highest.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for you (above your $1,000,000 minimum).

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy in place.  You may need to adjust your price slightly downward to reach a deal."
