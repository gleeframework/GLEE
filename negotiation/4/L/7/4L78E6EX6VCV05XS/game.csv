"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll be getting.  Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can offer $1,300,000. It's a significant investment on my part and shows how serious I am about acquiring this product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
