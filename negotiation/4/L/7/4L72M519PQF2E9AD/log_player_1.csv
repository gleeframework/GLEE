Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob a good incentive to negotiate, but I'm still above my minimum price of $100. If he rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes, keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum price, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to give the product away. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's $15 less than my initial offer, but it's also above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
