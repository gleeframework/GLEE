Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and provides a solid foundation for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 sets a strong initial point. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it allows room for negotiation and keeps the price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing""  signals flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to make a deal that works for him. If he rejects the offer, you have the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase at your minimum price."
