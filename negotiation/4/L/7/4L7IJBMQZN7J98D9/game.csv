"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant reduction from your initial assessment of the product's value. However, I'm still not convinced that it's a fair price for this unique item. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. My revised offer is $1600000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $1500000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
