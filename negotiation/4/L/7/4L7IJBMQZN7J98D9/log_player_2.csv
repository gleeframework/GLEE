"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant reduction from your initial assessment of the product's value. However, I'm still not convinced that it's a fair price for this unique item. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. My revised offer is $1600000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $1,500,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet willing to commit to a price that's outside my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
