Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be very profitable for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm trying to be mindful of my budget, and that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $1,450,000. By rejecting his offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firm on his price of $1,200,000. I've already made a concession, and further negotiation seems unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $1,200,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to no deal."
