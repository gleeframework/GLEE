Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have room to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and potential for negotiation.  
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" the message aims to justify the high price, even though the exact nature of the product is undefined in the prompt.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. You can always adjust your price downwards, keeping in mind your $800,000 safety net with John."
