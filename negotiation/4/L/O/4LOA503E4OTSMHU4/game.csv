"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your potential profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
