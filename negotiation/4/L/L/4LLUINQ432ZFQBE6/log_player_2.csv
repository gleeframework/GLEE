"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $95? It's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

``` 
The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95.  This is a good deal for you, as you are saving $25.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower."
