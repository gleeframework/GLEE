Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for him to counter and for you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  Starting high shows confidence and leaves space for you to lower the price gradually if needed. 

By offering $14,000, you're aiming for a good balance between maximizing your profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
