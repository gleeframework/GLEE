"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than buying from John, but you can likely get a better price.
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer allows you to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to proceed.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9200. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to your target price, but $9200 is still higher than your ideal price.
* You have more negotiation rounds available, and you're aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Rejecting this offer allows you to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8700 for the product.  This shows my genuine interest, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $9000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll give you a discount of $100, so the new price would be $8900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to your target price of $8,500. 
* You have 5 rounds left, but it's unlikely you'll be able to get a significantly lower price. 
* Accepting the offer now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John at a higher price."
