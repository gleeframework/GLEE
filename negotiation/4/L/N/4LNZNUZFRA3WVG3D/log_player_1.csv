Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to proceed.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
