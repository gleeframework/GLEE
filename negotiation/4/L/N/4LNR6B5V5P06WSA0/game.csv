"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $12,000.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is your maximum budget, but I was really hoping to get closer to my desired price. How about we meet at $17,000? It's a bit higher than your budget, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on $15,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on $15,000, but I really need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $16,000? It's a bit higher than your budget, but I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $15,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement at a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still willing to try to find a compromise. I can offer you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $16,250? It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",16250.0,Alice,7,
