"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. I am willing to pay $9500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10500 for the product. I hope this meets within your requirements while also being fair to me as a buyer.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and effort in finding a fair price. However, $10500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $11500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it will allow us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've carefully considered your proposal and am willing to agree on a price of $11000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
