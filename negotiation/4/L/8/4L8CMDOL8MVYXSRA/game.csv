"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand the product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 isn't enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer and gets us closer to a deal. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but I really think we can do better than that. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need you to meet me halfway.",775000.0,Bob,6,
