"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least secure the $800,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand the product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum threshold, $750,000 is still below my target. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can get a higher price from Bob or secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 isn't enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer and gets us closer to a deal. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but I really think we can do better than that. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need you to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds left, Bob is not moving much closer to my target price.  While $775,000 is tempting, I have a guaranteed $800,000 offer from John. I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds, so it's time to secure the safe option."
