"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $7,500 is decent, there's a good chance I can negotiate a lower price. It's the first round, so there's room to haggle without seeming unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation. It's a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $7,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good. However,  $7,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to see if she'll budge a bit more before considering accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $6,500? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

This counter-offer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous counter-offer. It shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'll offer you a slightly higher price. How about $6,800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is definitely getting closer to my desired price range, but every bit saved counts. It's still early enough in the negotiation to push back a little further before considering accepting her offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""It seems like we're getting closer, Alice.  What if we settle on $6,600? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 6600
}
```

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving and aims for a price closer to my target. It shows I'm willing to meet her halfway between our last two offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,600, Bob. I'll offer you a slightly higher price. How about $6,900? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is very slowly moving towards my desired price range, but at this point, the difference is becoming small. It's not worth risking the negotiation falling through for another $100, especially with John's offer as a backup. $6,900 is a good deal."
