"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable value, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by pushing for more. It's better to secure the $800,000 now than to risk further negotiation and possibly ending up with nothing."
