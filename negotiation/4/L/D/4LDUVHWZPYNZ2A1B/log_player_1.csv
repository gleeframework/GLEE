Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price considering its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to me, implying it's a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion, showing I'm open to a back-and-forth.
* **John as leverage:**  I'm keeping John in mind. If Bob rejects my offer, I can always go with John, securing my minimum price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would that be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I have leverage because I can sell to John for a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and push him closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for compromise:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my target, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price slightly higher than his offer but lower than my previous offer.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is still a good deal for both of us.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm again leaving the door open for further negotiation, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, ensuring I have a backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet you at $13,500. My maximum budget remains at $12,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for negotiation:** Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to budge from $12,000.
* **John's offer is better:** John's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer and is closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a worse outcome.

I've decided to sell to John for the better price.  While I would have liked to get closer to my ideal price, ensuring a sale at a decent price is more important than potentially continuing a negotiation that might not result in an agreement."
