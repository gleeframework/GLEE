"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you be open to $11,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and would allow me to make this purchase.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,500. This is as low as I can go, and it's still a great price for a product of this quality. Can you meet me at this price?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle on $12,500?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think it's a fair compromise. Can you consider this offer?",13000.0,Alice,7,
