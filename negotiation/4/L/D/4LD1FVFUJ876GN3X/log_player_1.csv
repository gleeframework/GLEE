"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering me for the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I am only able to offer $150 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, which is still less than my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price without wasting time on a deal that's unlikely to improve."
