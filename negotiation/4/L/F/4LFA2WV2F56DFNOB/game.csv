"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects a significant discount from my original offer and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, but I still think $9,500 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This price is still above your latest offer but represents a significant concession from my previous one. If you're serious about buying the product, I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,800. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 just isn't enough for me.  To make this work, I need to be at $10,200. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this now and move forward.",10200.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to go above $9,500. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",9500.0,Bob,10,
