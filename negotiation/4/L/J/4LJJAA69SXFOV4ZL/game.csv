"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you makes it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This represents a significant discount for you and a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to sell the product, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I can get out of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
