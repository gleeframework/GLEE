"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you makes it a worthwhile investment.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.
