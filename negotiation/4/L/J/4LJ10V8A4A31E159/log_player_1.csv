Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that reflects my minimum acceptable price while still giving Bob some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I will carefully consider his counteroffer and be prepared to negotiate further. However, I will also keep John in mind as a backup buyer, ensuring I receive at least my minimum desired value for the product."
