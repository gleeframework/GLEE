"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's best not to accept the first offer. Alice is starting quite high, knowing there's room for negotiation. A counteroffer will likely lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000), we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and establish a lower anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite and conveys our interest while clearly stating that the initial price is unacceptable.

This strategy allows us to understand Alice's position better and leaves room for negotiation towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $10,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved down a bit, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $13,000 would be a win for us, but let's see if we can get it closer to $11,000, which would be a great deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a valuable product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer represents a fair compromise, splitting the difference between her previous offer ($13,000) and our previous counteroffer ($10,000). 
* **Signaling Willingness to Negotiate:** By moving closer to her price, we demonstrate a willingness to find a mutually agreeable deal.

This approach keeps the negotiation moving and increases the chances of reaching a favorable agreement without being overly aggressive or conceding too much."
