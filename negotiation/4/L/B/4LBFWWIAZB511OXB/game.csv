"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the potential in this product, $2,250,000 is significantly beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum value and the fact that I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal. ",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is appealing, the product's value remains higher than that. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
