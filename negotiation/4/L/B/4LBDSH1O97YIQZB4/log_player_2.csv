"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is undeniable. I can come down to $1,100,000, which I believe reflects a fair deal for both of us.
