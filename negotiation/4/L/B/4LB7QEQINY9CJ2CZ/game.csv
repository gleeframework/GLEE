,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  If we can meet in the middle, I think we can make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,250 is still a bit outside my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $8,800. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $8,900.",8900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  While $8,900 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",8500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,750.",8750.0,Alice,9,
