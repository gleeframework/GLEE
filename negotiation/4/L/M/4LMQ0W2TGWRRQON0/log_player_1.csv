Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you.  I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher than Bob's value, but lower than my minimum:**  $1,700,000 is a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, making it tempting for him. However, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, meaning I'm still getting a good deal.
* **Room for negotiation:** This price allows for some room for negotiation if Bob counters. I can potentially come down a bit, but still stay above my minimum.
* **Better than my backup option:** Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000. This offer gives me a chance to potentially earn more."
