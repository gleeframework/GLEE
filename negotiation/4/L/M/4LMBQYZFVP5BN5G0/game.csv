"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $17000 for the product. This is a fair price that I believe reflects its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet at that price. I would like to propose $16000 as my final offer.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll propose a price of $16500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",16500.0,Alice,5,
