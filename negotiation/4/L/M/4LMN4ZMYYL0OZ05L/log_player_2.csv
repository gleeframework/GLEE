Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering Alice the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. This gives her a chance to accept, but if she doesn't, I can switch to John without any loss."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice's offer is within my budget, and while I'd prefer to pay less, it's a better deal than buying from John. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
