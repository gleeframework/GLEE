Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm offering $9,250. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still leaves a good profit margin for me. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $9,100 is a good deal considering my minimum selling price and the potential of further negotiation delays. It's better to secure a solid profit now than risk losing a sale and having to settle for John's lower offer."
