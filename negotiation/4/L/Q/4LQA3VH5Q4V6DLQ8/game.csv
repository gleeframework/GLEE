"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $18000. Can you consider that?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer. $18000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $19000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $18500?",18500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider $18500, but I'd prefer to go with $18750. This would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?",18750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $18400? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",18400.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting close to walking away here.  I'm really not comfortable going lower than $18200. This is my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  What do you say?",18200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go lower, but I'm still not comfortable with $18200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $18200, which is $18100. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",18100.0,Bob,10,
