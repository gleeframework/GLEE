"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $130. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $120.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my absolute maximum is $115. If you're willing to go that low, we can make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $115, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $120, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
