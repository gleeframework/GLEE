"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping to establish a starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer downwards in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob at $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with what John is willing to pay.  If Bob rejects, I'll likely move to selling to John, as I've reached my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still not acceptable. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping my offer to $1,100,000.  I'm hoping to find some middle ground with Bob. If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. His offers are still too low.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's the best option at this point to guarantee I receive my minimum price."
