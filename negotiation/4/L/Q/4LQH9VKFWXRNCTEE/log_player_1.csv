{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also allows you to potentially get a higher price than John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. It's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go up to $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, Bob's offer of $9,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer, and it's close enough to my minimum desired value of $12,000. I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a breakdown in communication."
