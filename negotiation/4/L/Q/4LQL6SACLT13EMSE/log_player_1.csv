"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his valuation and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob.  If he rejects again, I'll need to consider dropping my price further or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,600,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm hoping to meet in the middle with Bob.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make one more counteroffer in the next round. I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price. If he rejects again, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,550,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price and a significant drop from my previous counteroffer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise and will finally convince Bob to accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. We've gone back and forth several times, and it's clear we're not going to reach a deal. With only three rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm going to sell to John and secure the guaranteed price of $1,500,000."
