"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will deliver a strong return. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm also considering the option of selling to John for $10,000, so I'm not completely dependent on Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $12,000? I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm confident this price is fair, given the potential value of the product. I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value of $10,000, but it's still not enough. I have more rounds to go, and I'm confident I can push for a better price. While selling to John for $10,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,500?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $10500 is closer, it's still a bit over my limit. I'm prepared to offer $10000.  This is my final offer.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm eager to close the deal. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $10,000 matches my minimum value for the product. It's a good deal, especially considering John is also willing to buy for $10,000. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
