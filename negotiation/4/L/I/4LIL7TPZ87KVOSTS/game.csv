"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. That's still a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $155? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget.",155.0,Bob,4,
