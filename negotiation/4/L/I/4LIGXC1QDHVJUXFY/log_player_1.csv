""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob increases the chances of him accepting.
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net, ensuring you don't go below that price."
