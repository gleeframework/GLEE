Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could start at $150, there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price. By offering it at $140, we maximize potential profit while staying above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  The phrase ""limited time"" adds a bit of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Value Focus:**  Instead of just stating the price, highlighting the ""value it provides"" aims to frame the offer positively in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer, but this approach balances risk and potential reward."
