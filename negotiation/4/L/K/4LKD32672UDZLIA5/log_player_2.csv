You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $130 is less than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  Alice values the product at $120, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a reasonable compromise between your desired price and Alice's asking price.  It's still a decent deal for you, and it leaves room for Alice to accept while still making a profit."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than your initial counteroffer, but it's still within a reasonable range. However, there's still room for negotiation, and you're likely to save more by continuing to counteroffer. It's worth trying to get closer to your ideal price before potentially going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's latest offer and your previous offer. Since Alice is willing to negotiate, this counteroffer signals your willingness to compromise and reach a middle ground. This could encourage Alice to accept, as she is likely to make a profit at this price, while still allowing you to save money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer is close to your ideal price, and further negotiation might not lead to significant savings. Since John's offer is much higher, accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price while saving money compared to John's price."
