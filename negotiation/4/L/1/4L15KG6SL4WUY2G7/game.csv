"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However,  the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair offer reflecting the product's true worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While your offer is tempting, I can't accept anything less than $1,600,000 for this product. I'm confident that at this price, it's still a steal for the value it brings.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
