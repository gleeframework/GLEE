Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying significantly above your minimum price. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure that might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly. 

**Important:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects this price, you can gradually lower it, but never go below your $800,000 minimum (which you have secured with John's offer)."
