"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $1,400,000 is still above your target of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a better price.  
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always go with John, but it's not the best outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive start:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** While $1,200,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, it still leaves room for Alice to counter without going below her minimum price.  
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and provide valuable information for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still potential for improvement. 
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** Accepting at $1,300,000 would be a good deal, but it might be possible to get an even better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Strategic counteroffers:**  By rejecting the offer, you can send a counteroffer to explore if Alice is willing to come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:** Instead of a huge jump, I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount. This shows a willingness to compromise and suggests you're getting closer to a deal.
* **Midpoint strategy:** $1,250,000 is the midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. It signals you're willing to meet halfway, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting.
* **Pressure on Alice:**  By making a reasonable counteroffer, you put some pressure on Alice to come down further or risk losing the deal."
