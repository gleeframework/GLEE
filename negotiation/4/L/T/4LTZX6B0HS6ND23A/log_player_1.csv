"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe this will maximize my potential profit while also leaving space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I believe I can secure a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's above my minimum.  I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also shows Bob that I'm not going to give away the product for cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd still like to push for a higher amount, accepting this offer ensures a significant profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal completely.  I also have to consider the remaining rounds and the possibility of a lower counteroffer from Bob in the future."
