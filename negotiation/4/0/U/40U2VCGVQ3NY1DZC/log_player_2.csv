"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I value at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price. Let's call it $12,000. This would be a great deal for you as you'd be getting a product worth much more to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
