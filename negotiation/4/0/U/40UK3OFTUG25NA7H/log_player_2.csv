"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its potential worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $15,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's within his budget but also leaves some room for negotiation.  $13,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum value.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting halfway at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's within Bob's budget and is only slightly higher than his initial counteroffer.  At this point, it's beneficial for Bob to accept the offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity to buy the product from Alice.  Buying from John for $15,000 would be less beneficial."
