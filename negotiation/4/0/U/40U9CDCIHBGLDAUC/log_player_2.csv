"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer at $10,000 isn't ideal.  You haven't established a baseline for negotiation yet.  You can always buy from John, so rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your intent to negotiate seriously. 
* **Leaving Room:** $7,000 still leaves some wiggle room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** You're taking a calculated risk by going low, but it could lead to a much better price than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, you can likely still get a better price.
* **Avoiding Risk:** You're still within your $10,000 limit, so there's no need to rush into a decision. 
* **Strategic Play:**  By continuing to reject, you're showing Alice you're serious about finding a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This is a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Building Momentum:** By gradually increasing your offer, you're showing Alice you're willing to negotiate but still want a good deal. 
* **Staying Within Range:** $8,000 is still a good price, keeping you under your $10,000 limit and potentially getting a better deal than John's."
