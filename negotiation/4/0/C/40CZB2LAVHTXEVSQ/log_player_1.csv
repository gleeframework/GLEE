Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this product has great value, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
