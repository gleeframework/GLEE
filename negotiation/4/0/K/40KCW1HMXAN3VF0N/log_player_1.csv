{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $110. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $110 is still a decent deal for him. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $120, so you have room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **It shows willingness to negotiate:**  The message indicates you're open to discussing the price further."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $95 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

While $95 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum of $120.  I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum of $120, I'm still not quite there.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a little higher."
