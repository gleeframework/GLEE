"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $95 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your needs.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position. I would like to counter with an offer of $105 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you and my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  Would you be willing to go up to $110? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to seal the deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
