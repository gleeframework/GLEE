"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I understand it's a lot of money, but considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while also allowing us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
