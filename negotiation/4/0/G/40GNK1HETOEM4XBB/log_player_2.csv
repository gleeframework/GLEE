"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000 vs. $1,200,000). This suggests she has room to negotiate. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to the true value of this product. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I have to consider my own valuation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is exactly what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000).  There is no room for further negotiation and it's the same price as buying from John.  Since we have 10 rounds, it's possible Alice will keep refusing counteroffers and we could end up stuck.  It's safer to just buy from John and be done with it."
