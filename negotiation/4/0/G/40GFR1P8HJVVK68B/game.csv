"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.  This price still represents a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $850,000.  How about we settle at $950,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us â€“ you get the product at a price that's within your budget, and I get a price that's closer to my initial offer.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
