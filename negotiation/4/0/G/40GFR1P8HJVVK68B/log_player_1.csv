``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than what John is offering, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I want to maximize my profit, I'm not desperate to sell.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $850,000.  How about we settle at $950,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still too low.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for anything that's significantly less than my initial offer.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer but still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us â€“ you get the product at a price that's within your budget, and I get a price that's closer to my initial offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
