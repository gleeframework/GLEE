"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $12,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I'm confident will bring you significant benefits. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $12,000, which is too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's more in line with your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower."
