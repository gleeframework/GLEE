"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. This is my best offer, as I can easily acquire the same product elsewhere for that price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's more in line with your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8,500.  I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm only able to pay this amount.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll need to go with John's offer.",8500.0,Bob,4,
