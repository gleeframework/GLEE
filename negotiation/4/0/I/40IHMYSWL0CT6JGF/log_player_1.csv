Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me the best chance of getting the highest price possible. Since John is willing to pay this much, I have no reason to lower it immediately. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate further, and I'll see if I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm going to offer $11,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. Hopefully, he'll be willing to pay this price, but I'm also not giving away too much of my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still not ideal. At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to risk further negotiations with Bob that could ultimately result in a lower price or a stalemate."
