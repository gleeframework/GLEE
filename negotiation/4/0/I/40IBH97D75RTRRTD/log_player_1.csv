{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're getting very close to a deal with Bob, but there's not much room left for negotiation. I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he'll walk away and I'll have missed out on a chance to get a decent price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and I can always try to negotiate with Bob later if the opportunity arises."
