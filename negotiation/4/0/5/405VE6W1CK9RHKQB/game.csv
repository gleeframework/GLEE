"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that price might be a little high for you, but $60 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price, and I'm really interested in the product.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $92.50? ",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see we're getting closer, Alice.  Let's try $80, my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm eager to get my hands on this product.",80.0,Bob,6,
