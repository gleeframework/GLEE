Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that price might be a little high for you, but $60 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $92.50? "", ""product_price"": 92.50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see we're getting closer, Alice.  Let's try $80, my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm eager to get my hands on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $80 is his absolute limit. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get him much higher. Selling to John for $120 guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids further time and effort spent negotiating with Bob."
