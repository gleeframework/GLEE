I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for potential negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm confident I can get my full price from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $975,000.  This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate, but still closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $940,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident I can get much higher.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my desired price of $1,200,000."
