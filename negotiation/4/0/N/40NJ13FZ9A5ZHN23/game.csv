"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I could do $1,025,000, but that's my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
