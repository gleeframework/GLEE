"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be feasible for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen.  However, I need a price that reflects its true worth.  How about $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, I am very keen on getting this product. $11,750 is still a bit steep for me though. What if we settle at $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11250.0,Bob,6,
