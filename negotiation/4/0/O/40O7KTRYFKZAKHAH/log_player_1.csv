While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear that we are unlikely to reach a price that significantly surpasses John's offer of $10,000. Accepting Bob's offer of $9,500 would be a loss compared to John's guaranteed price.  Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price from Bob, but the potential gain is likely not worth the risk of extended negotiation and the possibility of Bob lowering his offer."
