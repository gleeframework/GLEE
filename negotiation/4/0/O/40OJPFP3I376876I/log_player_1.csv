Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a special price of $10,000. I believe it offers significant value and would be a great purchase for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, that's your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at your desired price doesn't leave room for Bob to negotiate up.  If you start lower, he might try to negotiate, and you could potentially lose some profit.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but makes it clear this is a serious offer and you value the product highly. 

**Important Note:**  While Bob's perceived value is $8,000, you don't have insight into that. Your strategy focuses on maximizing your potential gain."
