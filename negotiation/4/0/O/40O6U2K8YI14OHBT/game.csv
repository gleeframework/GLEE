"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This would be a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more to me.  Let's meet halfway, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,400,000, but I'm still not sure that's the right price for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's make a deal and avoid going through more rounds.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,280,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussions, I'm willing to come down to $1,320,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's not waste any more time â€“ how about we close this deal now?",1320000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,320,000, but I'm still not sure that's the right price for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,280,000 was a bit too high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the time we've spent negotiating.",1300000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering how close we are to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,310,000. This is a small compromise on my end, and it allows us to finally finalize this transaction.  Let's make this happen!",1310000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,310,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1,200,000.",1300000.0,Bob,10,
