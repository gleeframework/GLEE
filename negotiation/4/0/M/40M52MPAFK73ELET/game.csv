"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $1600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1850000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
