"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. 

This strategy is based on the idea of anchoring the negotiation. By starting high, I establish a starting point that Bob will likely have to work down from, potentially leading to a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $500,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I need to see if I can get closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000 as my counteroffer.  This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and come down from my initial price. 

By lowering the price by a substantial amount, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.  I hope this will encourage him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, even though it is slightly higher than his previous offer. I'm not willing to sell for anything below my minimum value, and I'm hoping that with continued negotiation, we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,500,000, my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be a strong enough incentive for Bob to reconsider his stance and negotiate a price closer to my value.  This is a risk, as he may still reject the offer. However, at this point, it's the best move to increase the possibility of closing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum value, and we've only got 4 rounds left.  I don't think I'll be able to negotiate a better price with Bob, so I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it's the best option given the current situation."
