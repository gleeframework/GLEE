It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge significantly:** Alice's offer is moving further away from your target price. This suggests she's becoming less flexible and less likely to accept an offer within your desired range. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing the negotiation could lead to frustration and potentially bad decisions. It's best to cut your losses and pursue a sure thing. 
* **John's offer is your safety net:** You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000. While not ideal, it's better than risking a higher price from Alice or a stalemate in the negotiation."
