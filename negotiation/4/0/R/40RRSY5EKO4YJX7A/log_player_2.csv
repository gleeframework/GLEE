"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially securing a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $75?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $82? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $82 is a good compromise, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially securing an even lower price. It's worth continuing to explore whether a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $75 is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $78? It's closer to my initial offer and hopefully a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 78}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget.  It's a reasonable compromise, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going below $85. Would you be willing to meet me at $84? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $84 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's getting closer to my budget and a better deal than buying from John for $120.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but the potential gains are small compared to the risk of losing a good deal."
