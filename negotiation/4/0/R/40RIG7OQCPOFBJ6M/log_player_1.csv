Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This strategy gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. It also leaves me the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum price.  I'm going to see if I can get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that recognizes your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $15,000 and allows me to sell the product without having to negotiate further. Selling to John for $15,000 would be a better outcome, but I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price."
