"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

You can get the product for $80 from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? Let's find a price we're both happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, you can still potentially get a better deal.  You're willing to pay $80, and John is offering it for that price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $88.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price.  $88 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is tempting, it's still a bit higher than your target price of $80, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John. It's worth one more round of negotiation with Alice to see if you can meet in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
