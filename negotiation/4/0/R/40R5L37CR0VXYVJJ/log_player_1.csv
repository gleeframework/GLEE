Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,600,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification for Value:**  The message to Bob doesn't just throw out a number. It emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential negotiation where you can still secure a price well above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  There's always a risk that Bob will reject a high offer outright. You could consider a slightly lower starting price if you want to increase the chances of immediate acceptance."
