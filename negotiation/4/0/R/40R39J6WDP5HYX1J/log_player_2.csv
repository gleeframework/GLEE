"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $17,000 is far above his budget and there's no reason to accept it when he can get a better deal from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should start with the lowest possible price that he's willing to pay.  He knows John is willing to sell for $12,000, so that's his starting point. It's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his ideal price, he can still get a better deal from John.  There's no reason to settle now when he has more room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly, but still keep it below his maximum price point.  A jump to $13,000 shows he's serious about buying the product from Alice but isn't willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still above his ideal price, it's only $2,000 more than what he can get from John.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with nothing is too high.  It's better to secure the product now, even with a slightly higher price, than to gamble on a better deal."
