Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still too wide.  I can come down slightly to $925,000. However, I need to be upfront â€“ if we can't agree on a price at this level, I'll need to explore other options for selling this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling she's unlikely to go much lower than $925,000.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep pushing.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, saving you at least $125,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure a good deal with John."
