"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good deal, but there's still room for negotiation. As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. I'm going to try and get a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still aiming for a lower price. There's room for further negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,080,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is a good price for me. While I'd ideally like to pay even less,  continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely. It's important to consider that:

* Alice has already made several concessions.
* My counteroffer of $1,050,000 was rejected. 
* Buying from John would cost $1,500,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is the most reasonable choice. It saves me a significant amount compared to John, and I'm still within my budget."
