"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value I'm placing on it and the benefits I expect to gain.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
