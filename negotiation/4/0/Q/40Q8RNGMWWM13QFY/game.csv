"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be even more valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1200000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950000 is a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? This allows for a significant profit for you and a fair return for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while I'm intrigued by the midpoint you've suggested, I must stay within my budgetary constraints. I would like to propose an alternative counteroffer of $1025000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you and keeps me within my financial limits. I hope this offers a satisfactory compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
