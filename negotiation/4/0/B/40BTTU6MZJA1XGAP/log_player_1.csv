"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm to my desire to earn more than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price. It's time to accept and close the deal. While I could potentially get a higher price in further rounds, there's no guarantee and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting at this point is the safest option."
