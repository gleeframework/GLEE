"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price of $1,500,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for us.  Let's try this â€“ $1,300,000.  I'm confident this product will more than pay for itself in your hands, and I want to make sure we can strike a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,275,000. I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
