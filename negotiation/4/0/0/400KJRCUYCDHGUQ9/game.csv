"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to consider it.",875000.0,Alice,3,
