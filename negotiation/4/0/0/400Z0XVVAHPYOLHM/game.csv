"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers substantial benefits, and I'm confident it's worth a considerable investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget.  Could you consider $950,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the investment I'm prepared to make.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need you to understand that this product is truly one-of-a-kind. $950,000 is still considerably lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,050,000, but that's my final offer. This is a fantastic deal for something with such potential.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your final offer is getting closer to what I can agree to. However, to make this work, I need to stay firm at $975,000.  This offer represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
