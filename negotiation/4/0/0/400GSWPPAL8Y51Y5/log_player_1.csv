Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a unique item, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, Alice can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:** Aiming for $1,500,000 allows for a potential 50% profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value, potentially justifying the price to Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The high initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price still higher than John's offer.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, Alice's guaranteed sale to John allows her to take this calculated risk for a higher potential profit."
