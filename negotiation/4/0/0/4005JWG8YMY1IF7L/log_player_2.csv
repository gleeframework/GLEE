"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $950,000.  I know this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, so this is a great opportunity to acquire it at a significant discount.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you give yourself the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with purchasing from John."
