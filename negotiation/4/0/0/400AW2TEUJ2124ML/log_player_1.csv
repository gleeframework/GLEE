Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, at $11,000.  This is a little more than what I'd accept from John, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. If he's truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal of $10,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still above my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet my price and I'm getting frustrated. I've already rejected his last offer and there's no guarantee that he'll come back with a better one. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000."
