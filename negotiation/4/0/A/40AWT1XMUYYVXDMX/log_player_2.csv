Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great price for you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's work together to find a solution.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within my budget and significantly lower than John's price.  While I'd still prefer a lower price, accepting this offer allows me to secure the product and move forward with my plans.  The risk of further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a higher price from John."
