"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth no more than $120 to you. Alice's offer of $60 is a good price. However, you can likely get an even better deal.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $45, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $60. This is a reasonable counteroffer that shows you're serious about buying the product but are also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $55, which is still a good deal for you.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again, and you might end up paying more or even having to buy from John for $120.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price within your budget."
