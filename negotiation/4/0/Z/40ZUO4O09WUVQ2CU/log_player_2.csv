"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth to both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject the offer. If I accept, I'll be paying $925,000, but the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so I'm overpaying by $125,000. If I reject the offer, I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is $200,000 more than Alice's offer, but at least I'll be buying the product at its true value to me.
