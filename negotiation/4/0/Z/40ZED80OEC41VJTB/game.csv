"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  I'm confident this product can generate substantial value for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
