"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below Bob's maximum value, leaving room for negotiation. This should encourage him to counteroffer and start the bargaining process.  I'm also staying well above my minimum value of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll use this round to counteroffer and see if I can push him up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,250. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price. It's also a good middle ground to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,750 is close to John's offer, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still confident I can get a higher price, especially since Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.  I'll use this round to counteroffer and see if I can push the price up just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only four rounds remaining, and Bob's offers consistently dropping, I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John. It's unlikely Bob will increase his offer enough in the remaining rounds to make it worthwhile.  $10,000 is still a good price, and it's a guaranteed sale."
