"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about $90? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my value. Let's try to find a middle ground.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. How about $78? That's my final offer.",78.0,Bob,6,
