Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** I don't immediately mention the $80 alternative (John) as that might make Bob less willing to negotiate. 

Let me know if you want to continue the negotiation based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  Since I can sell to John for the same amount, there's no benefit in continuing the negotiation. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and certain sale."
