You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for cheaper from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway, offering a price that is significantly lower than her original offer, but still potentially appealing to her, as she values the product at $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product for cheaper from John, and further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price."

Bob is trying to find a compromise, increasing his offer slightly from the previous round while still staying below the price John is offering. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product from her, but also that he's not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose option (3) and buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, and it's unlikely she will go lower than John's price.  It's more efficient to just go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
