I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a decent margin while hopefully still being within a range Bob might consider. I'll be prepared to negotiate if he rejects, but I want to see where his interest lies first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$5,000 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $7,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $6,500 is still less than I'd prefer, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
