Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its potential return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's true interest. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and potential ""return on investment"" aims to frame the product's worth in a way that might resonate with Bob and justify the high initial price.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its potential return on investment for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's a substantial amount, I know I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point where I'm losing out on a significant portion of the product's value to me. I'll counter-offer in the next round to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your initial offer is below what I can accept, I understand the value you see in this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This revised price reflects a more realistic assessment of its worth in the current market."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant drop from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Market Justification:**  I'm framing the price reduction as a ""realistic assessment of its worth in the current market"" to avoid appearing desperate or devaluing the product too much. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation while keeping John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, as I believe this is the maximum I can afford. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above the $1,500,000 I can get from John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could counter-offer again and try to squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk Bob might walk away. The potential gain from further negotiation is likely outweighed by the risk of losing a solid offer.
* **Securing a Good Deal:** Accepting $1,400,000 represents a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price and allows me to close the deal quickly."
