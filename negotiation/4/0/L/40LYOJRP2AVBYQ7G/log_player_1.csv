Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $800,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer.  It's better to secure a sure deal at my minimum than to risk Bob walking away and potentially getting a worse deal later."
