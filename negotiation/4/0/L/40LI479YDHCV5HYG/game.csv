"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $100, but I'm not quite ready to accept that just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, which would be $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $102?",102.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $102 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $105. I'm willing to give you a small discount, though - I'll meet you halfway between $105 and $102, which would be $103.5. What do you think?",103.5,Alice,5,
