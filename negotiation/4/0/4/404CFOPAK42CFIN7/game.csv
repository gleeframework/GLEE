"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for me. I could potentially go up to $7,000. Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
