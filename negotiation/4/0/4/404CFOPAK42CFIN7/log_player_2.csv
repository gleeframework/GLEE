Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and at this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might not result in a better price."
