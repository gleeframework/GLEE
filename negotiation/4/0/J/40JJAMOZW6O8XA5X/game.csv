"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $700000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value to me. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $800000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also respecting our respective positions.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
