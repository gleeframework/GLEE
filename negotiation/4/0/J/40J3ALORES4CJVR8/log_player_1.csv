"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I think that's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to reach a deal, accepting such a low offer would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential returns. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need to stick within a reasonable budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is slowly increasing, but it's still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more significant movement from his side to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  While I appreciate the increase in your offer, we're still quite a ways apart. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,600,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is now offering $1,250,000, which is above his initial valuation of the product and getting closer to my acceptable range. While I could potentially hold out for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the possibility of missing out on both Bob and John."
