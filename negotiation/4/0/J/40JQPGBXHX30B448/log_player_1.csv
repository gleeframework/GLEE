Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to me ($100) and slightly higher than what it's worth to Bob ($80). This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage. I also highlight the product's value to pique his interest. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged. By starting with a slightly high price, I can gauge his interest and potentially negotiate down to a price that's still beneficial for me. I'm also aware of the option to sell to John for $100, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can do better. It's worth seeing if I can squeeze out a bit more profit by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $90. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $95, which is the midpoint between my last offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but emphasizing that I still believe the product is worth more.  I'm also suggesting a compromise to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a compromise that is still profitable for me, while also showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate with Bob. This strategy keeps the negotiation going and increases my chances of getting a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit over budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum price of $100. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of further concessions outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees my minimum desired profit and ensures a quicker transaction."
