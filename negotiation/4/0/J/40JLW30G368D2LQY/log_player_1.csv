"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $17,000. This is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate. It also sends a signal that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm lowering the price to $15,500. This is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. I'm still confident I can get a better price with more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to lower the price to $14,500.  While it's still a bit more than what Bob's offered, it's a compromise to show I'm serious about a deal.  I'm hoping he'll meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to what I want,  I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher. We're already in the 6th round and time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $14,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's important to keep the deal moving.  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and time is running out. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're in round 8 and we're getting close to the end of the negotiations. While $13,750 is not a bad price, it's still below what I want.  I'm confident that John is a more reliable buyer and will pay me my asking price. I'm going to sell the product to John."
