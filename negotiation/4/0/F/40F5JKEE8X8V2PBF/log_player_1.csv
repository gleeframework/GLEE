We're still in the game. Bob is clearly interested but trying to get a steal. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher."

It's becoming clear that Bob is anchored at $800,000 and unlikely to budge significantly.  While we could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of leaving money on the table. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, which is our minimum acceptable price. It's time to take the sure thing."
