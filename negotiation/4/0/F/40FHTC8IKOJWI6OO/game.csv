"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $15000? I believe we can find a fair solution.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $17500? This reflects the product's value and gives you a fair price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",17500.0,Alice,3,
