Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's self-interest:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing the potential profit he can make.
* **Open to counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard deadline, leaving room for Bob to negotiate.
* **John as a backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 allows me to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I don't want to break the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob acknowledged a willingness to pay a premium. 
* **John's offer is a strong fallback:** I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $950,000 is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasize the value to Bob:** I reiterate the great deal he's getting at this price.
* **Suggest a meeting point:** I phrase it as a ""meeting in the middle"" to encourage Bob to accept.

This approach aims to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while remaining open to further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $925,000 is still below my minimum of $1,200,000, it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer.
* **Limited upside for further negotiation:**  Bob has indicated he's close to his budget, making it unlikely he'll go higher.
* **John's offer is a strong fallback:** If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000.  However, there's a chance Bob might walk away entirely if I continue to push for a higher price.

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer at $925,000 is the most sensible decision. It secures a sale and a decent profit, while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
