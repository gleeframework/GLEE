# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,100,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to get closer to the value I place on this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
