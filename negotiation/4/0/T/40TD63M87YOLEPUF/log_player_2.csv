"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. It's a steal of a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a great deal for Bob! Alice's offer of $900,000 is well below his maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly less than John's offer."
