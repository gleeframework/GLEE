"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still trying to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and $9,500 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  He can potentially negotiate further with Alice or simply buy from John.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to save a bit more, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $9200, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's maximum budget is $8,000.  Alice's offer of $9,200 is still too high.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $8,000.  Further negotiation with Alice might be possible, but there's no guarantee of a successful outcome, and Bob might end up paying more than $8,000."
