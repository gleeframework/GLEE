"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $75.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $75 is a bit too low for me, considering what I've invested in this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  Let me know if that works for you.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $82.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $80, which is right at my budget limit. Let's see if we can finalize this.",80.0,Bob,4,
