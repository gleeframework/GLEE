# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $13,000. While she might be willing to come down a little further, it's unlikely she'll reach our target price of $12,000.  John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, which meets our budget. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John."
