"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my potential other offers. Let's meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I cannot agree to $1,075,000. I am willing to pay $1,062,500 for the product. This is a reasonable price considering its value and my budget.",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1,068,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while remaining within my desired price range. Let's finalise this deal.",1068750.0,Alice,5,
