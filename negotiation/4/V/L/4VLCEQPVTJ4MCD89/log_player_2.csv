Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice before going with John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $16000 for the product. I'm confident it's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

Alice's offer is still too high, even though she has lowered her price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit higher than $14000. I can do $16500 for the product. I think it's a fair price, considering its value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is not budging much from her price and it seems like we're at an impasse.  While a deal at $16,500 is possible, it's better to go with John at this point. It saves you money and avoids further negotiation."
