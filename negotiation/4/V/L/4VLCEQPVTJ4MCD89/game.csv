"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product but I can only go as high as $12000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $16000 for the product. I'm confident it's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a little higher than I'd like to go, but I can offer $14000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit higher than $14000. I can do $16500 for the product. I think it's a fair price, considering its value and uniqueness.",16500.0,Alice,5,
