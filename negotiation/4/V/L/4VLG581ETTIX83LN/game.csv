"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  How about $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"It seems like we're still quite far apart on price, Alice.  I'd be willing to go up to $90, but I can't go any higher than that.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  Let's try $130. I believe that's a reasonable compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers, say $110?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I have another buyer for $150, but I'd prefer to work something out with you.  My final offer is $125 - how does that sound?",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand where you're coming from. While $125 is closer, I have a strict budget. If you're willing to come down a bit more, we might have a deal.",105.0,Bob,8,
