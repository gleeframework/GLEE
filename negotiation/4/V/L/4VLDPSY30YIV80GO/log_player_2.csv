Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I will reject and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $9,500. How about we meet at $10,500? It's a bit more than you were suggesting, but I think it's a fair price for the product.

While Alice is coming down in price, $10,500 is still over my budget.  I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $8,000.  It's a better deal for me, and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a longer negotiation with Alice."
