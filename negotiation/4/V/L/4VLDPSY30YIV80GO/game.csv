"That's a bit steep for me, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we split the difference at $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $9,500. How about we meet at $10,500? It's a bit more than you were suggesting, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
