"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000, but I'm willing to pay a premium for it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $850,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $775,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. Let's settle on $812,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $812,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'm thinking of $795,000. This is as high as I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",795000.0,Bob,6,
