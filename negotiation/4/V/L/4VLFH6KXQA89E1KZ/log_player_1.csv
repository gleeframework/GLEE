"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 to start."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum price he's willing to pay, which is equal to my minimum acceptable price. There's no room for further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount without further risk of the negotiation failing."
