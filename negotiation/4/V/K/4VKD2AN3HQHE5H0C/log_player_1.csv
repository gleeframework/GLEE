Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still exceeding my minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 allows a small buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still ensuring a significant profit if he accepts.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my minimum acceptable price."
