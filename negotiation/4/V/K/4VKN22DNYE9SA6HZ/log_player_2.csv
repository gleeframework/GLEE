"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're looking to sell it for $140. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is starting with a moderate counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to his $120 value while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand your budget constraints. In light of your proposal, we would like to counter with an offer of $135 for the product. Please let us know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $135 is still above Bob's value of $120, but it's getting closer. 
* **Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or a higher price from Alice. Buying from John for $150 is also worse than Alice's current offer. 
* **Time:** With 7 rounds remaining, there's still time to find a better deal, but accepting Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise."
