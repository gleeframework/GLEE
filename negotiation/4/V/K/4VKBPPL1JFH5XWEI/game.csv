"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I agree it's a good product, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $1,200,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
