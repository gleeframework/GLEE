"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1300000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I still feel that $1300000 might be a bit steep for me. Could you consider offering it for $1200000? I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
