"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get at least $1,500,000 for the product.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility.  While I see the value of this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This would allow me to comfortably move forward with the purchase. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,500,000. My revised offer is $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I understand you need to get closer to your minimum, and I'm willing to go up a bit. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. This represents a significant move for me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum. My revised offer is $1,380,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1380000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm eager to finalize this deal, but $1,380,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,320,000. This represents a substantial step for me, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to move closer to my target. However, $1,320,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum. My revised offer is $1,360,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1360000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm ready to finalize this deal.  $1,360,000 is still a little above my budget, but I'm willing to go to $1,340,000. This is a substantial commitment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen.",1340000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this deal. However, $1,340,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to get as close to my minimum as possible. My revised offer is $1,380,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between this and your last offer of $1,340,000. Let's try $1,360,000, and see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1360000.0,Alice,9,
