I'm going to try and squeeze a bit more out of Bob. He's clearly interested, and $9,500 is still a good deal for me. I'll see if I can get him to come up a little."

While $9,200 is a decent offer, I'm still not quite at the price point I'm aiming for. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Bob is clearly unwilling to go any higher. While $9,000 is still a good amount of money, I've already been through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure I can get him to budge. Rather than risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with less, I'm going to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
