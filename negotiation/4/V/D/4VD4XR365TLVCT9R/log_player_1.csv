Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's enticing enough for Bob to accept while maximizing your profit. Aiming too high risks rejection, while going too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefit it offers. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value.  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Product Price:** $1,400,000 gives you a $200,000 profit over your minimum.  It leaves Bob with a $100,000 gain compared to his valuation, a strong incentive to accept. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower the price, leaving a bit more room for negotiation. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, a slightly less aggressive offer might be preferable.

**Remember:** This is just one possible approach.  The best offer depends on your risk tolerance and any additional information you might have about Bob's negotiating style."
