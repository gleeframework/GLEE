"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its value and rarity. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start by rejecting the initial offer and seeing if you can get a better price. $1,200,000 is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation. We have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so we have some leverage to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's value and rarity. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, given the product's worth and your budget. I'm open to further discussion and willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, which is good. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get her even lower in the next round. There's still room for negotiation, and we have time on our side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a significant step towards your last offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. Considering your budget and the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1080000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. I'm open to further discussion and willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now very close to my target price. While I'd love to see a price of $1,050,000, accepting this offer at $1,080,000 means saving $420,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal for both of us."
