"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $850000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's worth and my financial capacity.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value and the original price I had in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering a counteroffer of $785000.
