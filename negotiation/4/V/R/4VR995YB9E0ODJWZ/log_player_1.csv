"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Leaving some room for negotiation ($500) allows for potential counteroffers and a smoother bargaining process. 
* **Protecting My Minimum:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, ensuring I won't lose money if Bob rejects and I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Accepting would result in a loss. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I still have 8 rounds left. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $8,000 guarantees a profit, it's worth risking a few more rounds to try and get closer to Bob's perceived value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and Bob's last offer of $7,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $8,500 is still above my minimum, so I'm not risking a loss if Bob rejects this offer.
* **Creating Pressure:**  This counteroffer puts the pressure back on Bob, encouraging him to consider a higher price if he wants to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Closing the Gap:** While the gap is narrowing, it's worth seeing if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob with a counteroffer. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John would guarantee a profit, I'm choosing to gamble and see if I can get a price closer to $9,000 in the next round. I have 6 rounds left, so there's still time for a favorable deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing the price slightly from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is only $400 below my ideal price of $8,600, indicating I'm serious about getting a deal with Bob but not giving in too quickly.
* **Strategic Pressure:** This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob to come up with a better price if he truly wants to make a deal.  With 5 rounds remaining, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're in round 6, and I've only gotten Bob to offer $7,900. With 4 rounds left, the chances of reaching a significantly better price seem slim.
* **Guaranteeing Profit:**  Selling to John for $8,000 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who is proving to be a tough bargainer.
* **Cutting Losses:**  While I'd prefer to earn more, I'm prioritizing a guaranteed profit.  There's a risk of losing money if I continue negotiating with Bob and he continues to lower his offers."
