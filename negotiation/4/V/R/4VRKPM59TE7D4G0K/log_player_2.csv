"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum.  He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work this out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but Bob can still try to get a better price. He's only $80,000 away from his target price and has 7 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about $1,060,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. I'm eager to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,070,000, but this is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,070,000, which is only $70,000 above Bob's target price.  It's a good deal for Bob, and he's already had several rounds of negotiation.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to Alice becoming less flexible, or even walking away from the deal.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
