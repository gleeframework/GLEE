Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I know Bob values the product at $100, and I have a guaranteed sale at that price from John, aiming higher initially allows me to potentially maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $150 offer leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, even if he doesn't get it to his exact valuation.  
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob will outright reject the offer. However, I'm willing to take that risk knowing I have John as a backup buyer."
