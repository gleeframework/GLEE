"Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a fair offer,  I'm looking for a price closer to $950,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Can we meet at this price?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $925,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,6,
