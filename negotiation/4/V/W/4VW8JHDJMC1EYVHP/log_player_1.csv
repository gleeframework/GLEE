Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:**  My message emphasizes the potential savings for Bob and frames it as a good deal.
* **Flexibility:** This initial offer leaves room for counteroffers and negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a price closer to my target. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response and be prepared to counteroffer if necessary. I will use John's offer as a benchmark to determine my negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than my target price and leaves less room for negotiation in future rounds.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a safety net with John's offer, so I can afford to be more assertive in my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target, aiming to close the gap between our positions. I'll frame my counteroffer in a way that highlights the value of the product and the potential benefits of a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a fair offer,  I'm looking for a price closer to $950,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Justification:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but justifying my counteroffer by highlighting the product's value and the need for a price closer to my target.
* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm proposing a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer, I've maintained leverage and positioned myself to push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response carefully, considering his potential counteroffers and John's offer to determine my next move. I'll aim to reach a deal that maximizes my profits while ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** While $925,000 is closer to my target price than previous offers, it's still $275,000 less than my minimum acceptable price and leaves less room for future negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control and potentially push for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** John's offer provides me with a strong backup option, allowing me to be more assertive in my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that reflects my desired outcome, while still being reasonable. I'll aim to close the gap between our positions and reach a deal that maximizes my profits without jeopardizing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $925,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Justification:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but justifying my counteroffer by emphasizing the value of the product and the need for a price closer to my target.
* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm proposing a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is a final push to reach a price close to my target while remaining within a reasonable range for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll consider selling the product to John for $1,200,000, as my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000. However, I'll still be open to negotiating further with Bob if he is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer provides me with a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale for $1,200,000. It's a better outcome for me than accepting Bob's offer, ensuring I achieve my minimum acceptable price."
