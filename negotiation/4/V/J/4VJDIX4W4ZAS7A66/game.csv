"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is quite a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,500 for the product. Can we discuss further?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $14,000.  This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which normally costs $1,000. I'll include it for free if you meet me at $14,000. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",14000.0,Alice,5,
