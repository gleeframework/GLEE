"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850000. This is a fair price considering your desired sale price, and allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
