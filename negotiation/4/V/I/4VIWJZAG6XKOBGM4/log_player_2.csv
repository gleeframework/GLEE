It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  $8,500 is over your budget, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $7,500.  This is a good starting point to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
