The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking for $150. It's too expensive. You'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?

You're still aiming to save as much as possible, and $130 is closer to your ideal price of $120 but still a little high. You'll reject this offer and try to get closer to your target."
