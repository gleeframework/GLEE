Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value, but leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the benefit for Bob by emphasizing the product's worth to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate, which encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a strategic decision based on his price and my goal of maximizing profit.  If his counteroffer isn't acceptable, I'll make a counter-counteroffer or consider selling to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, the fact that he's willing to negotiate gives me an opportunity to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I maintain the potential to secure a higher price than the guaranteed $12,000 from John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $13,500 to make this work for me. It's a fair price considering the value you place on this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and Bob's last offer ($12,500). 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  I'm not giving in completely to Bob's initial offer, but I'm also signaling a willingness to compromise. 
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefit he'll receive.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I'm using language that encourages continued negotiation, hoping to reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Excellent! I've secured a price that's within my desired range.
* If Bob rejects: I'll carefully consider his counteroffer, and then either accept it (if it's close enough to my goal), reject it and make another counteroffer, or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($13,500) and his previous offer ($12,500).
* **Achieving My Goal:** Accepting this offer allows me to secure a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further price reductions or a potential deadlock, potentially forcing me to accept John's offer of $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer, finalize the sale, and secure a good profit for the product."
