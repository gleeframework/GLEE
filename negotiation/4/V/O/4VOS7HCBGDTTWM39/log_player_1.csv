Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiastic tone:**  A positive tone might make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed.  
* **John as a safety net:** The knowledge of John's offer gives me a fallback position and allows me to be more assertive during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am very interested, but I can only afford to pay $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  While I'd prefer more, $8,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob won't budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to another buyer. 
* **John's offer is a good safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for the same price gives me confidence to accept Bob's offer."
