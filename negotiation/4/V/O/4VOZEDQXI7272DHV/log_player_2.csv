Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,700 is a better price than John's, there's still a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another chance to get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $11,900, which is only $100 less than what John is offering. At this point, it's more worthwhile for Bob to buy from John.  The potential savings of $100 is not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
