,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, given my budget limitations.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $14,000?  This represents a significant step towards a mutually agreeable price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
