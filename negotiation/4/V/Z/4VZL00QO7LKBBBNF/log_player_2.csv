{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above my budget of $12,000.  I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, given my budget limitations.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $17,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm going to try to negotiate further before potentially going with John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $14,000?  This represents a significant step towards a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
