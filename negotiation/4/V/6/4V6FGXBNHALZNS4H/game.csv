"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its benefits, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $8,750.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. $8,750 is closer, but I need to be closer to $9,000.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to accept $8,800?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.",8800.0,Bob,6,
