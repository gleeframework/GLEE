"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and still get a good price. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm trying to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $17,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for an unreasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer again and try to negotiate further. There are still a few rounds left and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value. With 5 rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will realize that my minimum value is close to this offer, and he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I believe I can still secure a price closer to my minimum with the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to make one final attempt to get a price closer to my minimum. I'm lowering my price to $15,500. This is only $500 above my absolute minimum. With only 3 rounds remaining, I think this is a fair offer. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that my value is close to this and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left and Bob refusing to budge from his offer, it's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John. While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to have a sure thing than risk getting nothing at all."
