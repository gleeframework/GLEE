Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John.

By offering the product at $14,999, Alice creates a sense of urgency and a ""deal"" for Bob.  While it's unlikely Bob will pay more than his perceived value, there's a small chance he might be willing to stretch his budget slightly, especially if he believes the product is worth more in the long run. 

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can confidently sell to John at her desired price."
