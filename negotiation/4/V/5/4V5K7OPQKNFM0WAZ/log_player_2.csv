"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I think a starting price of $15,000 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is above his budget and he can get the product from John for $12,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for negotiation, potentially getting a better price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum. He can still get the product from John for his target price of $12,000. By rejecting, he can continue to negotiate with Alice and potentially get closer to his goal."
