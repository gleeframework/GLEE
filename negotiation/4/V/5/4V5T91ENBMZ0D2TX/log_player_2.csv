"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I think is a fair and reasonable starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to considering $925,000? That would make this a viable deal for me."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to push Alice further, this offer is significantly below her starting price and a good deal for us. It's only $25,000 more than John's offer. Continuing to negotiate risks Alice becoming firmer on her price or us running out of rounds and losing out on a good price."
