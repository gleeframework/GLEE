Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still allows you to make a significant profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation and profit. 
* **Appealing to Bob's self-interest:**  Highlighting the potential profit for Bob increases his incentive to accept.
* **Setting the stage for counteroffers:** By starting high, I anticipate a counteroffer from Bob, which will allow me to negotiate further. 
* **Keeping the John option in mind:**  While I'm hoping to negotiate with Bob, I'm not afraid to walk away if the price doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good value for my money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price and doesn't reflect the true value of the product.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **The John option is a safety net:**  Having the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation.  

I'll counteroffer Bob with a higher price, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still giving me a reasonable return on my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my desired price:**  $1,050,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's rationale:**  I emphasize the fair price and mutual benefit to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away the product at a significantly lower price.
* **John option as a backup:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'm prepared to sell to John and secure a much higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $975,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks him walking away or finding another seller.
* **John option as a fallback:** I still have the option to sell to John for a much higher price if this deal falls through. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical choice at this point. It allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing a deal altogether."
