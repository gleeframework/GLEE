"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $12,500 to make this worthwhile. This is a good deal for you as well, given the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a fair profit, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $11,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a price I'm comfortable with.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer.  I'm still hoping for a bit more, though.  How about $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us and ensures we both walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
