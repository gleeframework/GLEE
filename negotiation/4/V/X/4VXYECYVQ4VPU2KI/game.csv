"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1100000. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make another concession. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a price that's below its true value. I'm willing to sell it to John for $1500000, and I think it's worth considering. If you're still interested in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,7,
