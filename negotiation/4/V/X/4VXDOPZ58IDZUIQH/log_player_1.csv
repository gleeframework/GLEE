Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is not a good fit for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,100,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob's offer is too far below my minimum. It's time to move on to John who's offering a price I need."
