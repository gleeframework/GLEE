Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $9,000 for the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $10,125?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the $10,125. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much and his offer is still below my minimum. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm worried we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
