"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $9,000 for the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the $10,125. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can find a way to make this work.",9500.0,Bob,6,
