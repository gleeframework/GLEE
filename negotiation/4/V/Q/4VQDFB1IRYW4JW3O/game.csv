"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to you. I know you're a savvy businessman, so I'm confident you recognize the potential value here.  If you decline, I've already secured another buyer at $1,000,000, so this is your chance to secure a potentially significant advantage. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
