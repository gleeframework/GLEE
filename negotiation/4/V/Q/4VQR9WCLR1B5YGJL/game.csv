"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm open to discussing further if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you mentioned earlier. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this proposal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a fair price, I need to ensure I receive a value closer to what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest price I can go given the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
