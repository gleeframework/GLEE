# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a fair price, I need to ensure I receive a value closer to what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest price I can go given the product's value.
