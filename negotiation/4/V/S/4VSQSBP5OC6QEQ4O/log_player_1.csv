Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair return. How about $1,300,000? This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a strong compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? I think this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,250,000 is a good deal considering my minimum and the fact that John is also offering the same price."
