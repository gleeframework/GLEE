Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $18000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $13500.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $13,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $14750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750.
