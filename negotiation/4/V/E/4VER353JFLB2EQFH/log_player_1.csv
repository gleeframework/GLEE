"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It's also a significant amount that will likely grab Bob's attention and get him thinking about the value of the product.  I want to see how he reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for it right away. Bob knows this is my minimum, and he's starting low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still well above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low. I'm going to reject and counteroffer again. I need to stay firm and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and counteroffer at $850,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum and shows Bob that I'm willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much. I've already made several concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum. It's getting riskier to keep negotiating, as I'm running out of rounds.  To guarantee I don't end up with less than my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $800,000."
