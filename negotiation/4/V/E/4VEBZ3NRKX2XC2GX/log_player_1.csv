Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($80) and my minimum ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:**  The high starting price doesn't mean I expect Bob to pay that amount.  It allows me to gradually lower the price during the negotiation, potentially reaching a price that is favorable for both of us while staying above my minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** I am aware that I have a backup offer from John at $120. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation, as I am not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still above it to allow for some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is too low for me. Could you do $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've lowered my price significantly from the initial offer, signaling flexibility. The new price of $130 is a bit above my minimum but closer to the midpoint between our initial positions.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By staying above my minimum, I maintain some negotiating power and keep the possibility of accepting John's offer on the table. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:** This counter-offer encourages Bob to propose a price closer to my range, ideally above my $120 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer beyond $110. Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit without the risk of further drawn-out negotiations."
