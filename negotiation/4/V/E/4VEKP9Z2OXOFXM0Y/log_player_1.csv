Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product first. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering the product at $15,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a significantly higher profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial price, it opens the door for negotiation. You can then potentially settle on a price between $12,000 and $15,000."
