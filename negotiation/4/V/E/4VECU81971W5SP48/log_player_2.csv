"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than what you're willing to pay, it's still a decent amount over Alice's valuation.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is halfway between Alice's valuation of $80 and the price I'm willing to pay ($120). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation and shows good faith."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within my budget and a better price than what John is offering. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject my counteroffer or become unwilling to negotiate further. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without risking a loss of time and potential for a higher price with John."
