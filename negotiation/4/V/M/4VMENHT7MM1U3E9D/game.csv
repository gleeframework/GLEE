"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can consider a price of $850,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can consider a price of $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the best offer I can make, and I hope you can meet me at this price. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
