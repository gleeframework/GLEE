"Alice, I appreciate your offer.  While the product is valuable, $950,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your offer at $850,000. Our initial assessment of the product's value was based on its unique capabilities and potential impact, leading us to propose a price of $950,000. I am open to discussing this further, but I need to reiterate that the product's true worth aligns more closely with our original offer. Please let me know if there's room for negotiation towards $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to reach a deal at this point to avoid further negotiation.",875000.0,Bob,4,
