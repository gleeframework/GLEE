Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium, but if he rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate with him further or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident the product is worth more than $12,000 to Bob, and I'm going to try to get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering Bob a counteroffer of $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than his counteroffer. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product, and I hope Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than I initially hoped, it's a decent compromise. I'm getting a good price for the product, and it's better than taking John's offer.  It seems like Bob is firm on this price, so I'm going to take the deal and move on."
