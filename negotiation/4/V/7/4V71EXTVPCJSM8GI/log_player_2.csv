"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a discount, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000. He can get the product from John for a much lower price."
