"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your company. It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $950000.  This allows you a significant profit and ensures I get a fair return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,
