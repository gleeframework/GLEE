``` 

This offer starts with a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high to be immediately rejected. It also uses positive language to build rapport and emphasizes the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,050,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that low just yet. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but my product offers unique features that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000, but I'm not going lower.  This price reflects the true value of my product."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that your product has unique features, but I still think $975,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $980,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it seems like he's willing to meet in the middle. At this point, it's probably best to accept his offer and secure the deal. It's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly higher price, and I risk losing the deal entirely."
