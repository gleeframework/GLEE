Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to the maximum I believe Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 
* **Value proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, which can incentivize him to accept. 

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle with John's lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).  This means there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Risk of losing deal:** While $13,000 is a good price, I don't want to settle too quickly.  If I reject, I can potentially get closer to my target price of $14,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my original offer, but slightly lower to show I'm willing to negotiate.  This will keep the negotiations moving forward while trying to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $13,500 is the lowest I can go.  It's still a great price for the value this product will bring you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price slightly from $14,000 to $13,500. 
* **Maintain Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him that even at $13,500, it's a good deal. 
* **Pressure to Accept:**  This counteroffer puts pressure on Bob to accept, as it's likely closer to his desired price and represents a reasonable compromise.

**Strategy:**

By using a moderate counteroffer, I aim to create a sense of urgency for Bob to accept, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
