"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is lower than I can go. Would you consider $1,100,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I'm confident that this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
