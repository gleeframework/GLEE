Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $135. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $150 (its worth to John), aiming slightly lower increases the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Finding a Balance:** $135 is a price point where you significantly increase your potential profit compared to selling to John, while still offering Bob a price that's potentially attractive considering it's worth $120 to him. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested, allowing you to potentially secure an even better deal."
