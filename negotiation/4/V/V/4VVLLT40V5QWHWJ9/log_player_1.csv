Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a substantial discount:**  The offer is $3,000 below Bob's perceived value, making it attractive to him.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  You still have some wiggle room to negotiate further if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Provides a clear value proposition:**  You highlight the potential benefit to Bob. 

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your own comfort level with the potential profit."
