# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and the unique benefits it offers, we believe it's worth every penny of its true worth, which is $1500000 to you. However, I understand the importance of making transactions convenient and mutually beneficial. Therefore, I propose to offer you this remarkable product at a special introductory price of $1400000. This represents a significant saving of $100000 compared to its market value, providing you with an excellent return on investment. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. I am looking forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
