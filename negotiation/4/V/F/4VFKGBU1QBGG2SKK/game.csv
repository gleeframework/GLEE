"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I believe this product would be valuable to my business, but the price point you've offered is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,225,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to agree.  My final offer is $1,190,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
