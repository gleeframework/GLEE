Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is potentially higher than Bob's perceived $8,000 by mentioning ""listing it publicly.""
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects $10,000, you can always adjust down towards $8,000 knowing you have John as a backup.

It's important to remember that negotiation is a back-and-forth process. This offer is just the first step in potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
