"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Starting at $200 gives us some room to negotiate downwards without feeling like we're giving away too much. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes that we're open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage in the process.
* **Value Proposition:**  A simple statement about the product's potential benefit for Bob is a good start to build interest.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round, and our strategy may change depending on Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, we'll need to adjust our approach in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only do $150 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  We've established that the product is worth at least $150 to us. Accepting Bob's offer would leave us at our minimum, with no room for profit.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is at our minimum, his interest in the product is clear. There's still potential for negotiation, especially since we've already shown a willingness to compromise. 
* **Exploring Options:**  By rejecting the offer, we can explore whether Bob is willing to go higher. If not, we can still sell to John for the same amount.

**Next Steps:**  We'll need to carefully consider our counteroffer in Round 3, balancing the need to make a profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  I understand your price point, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $175?  It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We're acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to compromise, but not by a huge margin.
* **Value Justification:**  The message highlights the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Fairness:**  Framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" makes it seem more reasonable to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Interest:**  If Bob continues to show strong interest, we might be able to negotiate even higher.
* **Time Factor:**  We're already in round 3, so we need to balance finding a price we're happy with against the risk of running out of time.
* **John's Offer:**  We always have John as a backup option, but ideally, we'd like to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $175 is still a little high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $160.  This is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** Bob's offer of $160 is $10 more than our minimum value of $150, giving us a reasonable profit margin.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are already in round 4, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob and potentially ending up with John's offer of $150. 
* **Potential Risk:** While we could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee that Bob would agree, and we could end up in a stalemate.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows us to secure a sale and make a profit, while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
