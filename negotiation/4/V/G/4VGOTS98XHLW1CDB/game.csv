"Alice,  $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1000000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1500000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is still a bit above your comfort level, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1500000. I'm willing to compromise a bit, though. I can offer it to you for $1300000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
