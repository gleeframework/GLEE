"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely do better.  He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get the price down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good start, but I'm really looking to stay under $9,000.  Would you consider $9,200? "", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can do $9,800, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $10,000 to $9,800.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best choice.  Bob is saving $2,200 compared to buying from John, and the price is still lower than Alice's initial offer."
