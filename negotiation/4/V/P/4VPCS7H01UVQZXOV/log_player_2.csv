"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's not something I can readily disclose details about without a non-disclosure agreement, but I can assure you it's worth no less than $1500000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details further. If not, I will be selling it to another buyer at a lower price. This is a limited time opportunity, so please respond as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is asking for $2,000,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  You can get the product from John for less, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy."
