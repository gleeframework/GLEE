Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well above our minimum.
* **Justification for the price:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high asking price.
* **Sense of exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique item"" add perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important:**  While John offers a safety net at $800,000, this strategy aims to maximize profit. It's essential to gauge Bob's reactions during the negotiation and be prepared to adjust if needed."
