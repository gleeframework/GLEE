"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $130 is below his limit, it's still a good starting point to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for negotiation. This counteroffer is within Bob's budget and allows for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit low for me. How about $125?  I'm confident that you'll find this product to be worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the best price possible.  While $125 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives him another chance to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $120.  I'm really hoping we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate strategically. He's offered a price that's closer to Alice's last offer but still lower than her ideal. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a price that benefits him."
