"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to build a good rapport. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm hinting that the product is valuable without giving away too much information. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $130 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts, great!  I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down a little each round, but I won't go below my minimum ($100) before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** While $115 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100.
* **Negotiation:** I'm confident that I can get a better price through further negotiation with Bob.  He's shown interest and is willing to negotiate.
* **Time:** We're only in Round 2, and I have plenty of time to reach a deal closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $125. This will demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate while also staying firm on my value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit low for me. How about $125?  I'm confident that you'll find this product to be worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a slight concession from my initial offer of $130 but still staying above my minimum price of $100. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to meet me halfway.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to maintain a good rapport during the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Optimistic:** I'm hoping that Bob will accept this counteroffer. It's a fair compromise that should appeal to his interest in the product.
* **Prepared for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects again, I'll be ready to further adjust my price, but I'll try to stay above $120 if possible.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's offer of $100, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $120.  I'm really hoping we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $120 is very close to my desired price of $125, and represents a significant profit compared to John's offer.
* **Positive Negotiation:** Bob is showing continued interest in the product and is willing to negotiate, suggesting a potential for a successful deal.
* **Time Factor:**  We are in Round 4, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a significantly better price. There's a risk of losing the deal altogether if I continue to reject offers.

**Strategy:**

* **Accepting the Offer:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and eliminates the risk of a failed negotiation.
* **Future Considerations:** While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, I recognize that a deal is better than no deal.  I can use this experience to improve my negotiation tactics for future deals."
