"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? This gives us both some room to compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,250? I think this is a fair compromise.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,250 is a bit closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $10,400. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $10,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. It sounds like we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $10,300. That's a significant concession, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll get out of this product. Let's make this deal happen.",10300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,300 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,250? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm getting close to my limit.",10250.0,Bob,8,
