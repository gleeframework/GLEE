"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you consider $11,000? I'm willing to be flexible if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. Can we try to find a compromise?",9500.0,Bob,4,
