Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below its true value and the investment I've made in it. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the product's potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have budgetary constraints.  I can offer $900,000. This is a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still too far from my minimum acceptable price. I'll hold strong for now and see if I can negotiate him closer to a more reasonable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm able to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has reached his maximum offer, which is still below my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely he'll move any further. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob within the remaining rounds."
