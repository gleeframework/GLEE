"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for my company. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  Given the product's potential and my investment in it, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This price still allows us both to benefit significantly from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for my company. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
