"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  Since you're willing to pay $120 for the product anyway, there's no benefit in rejecting the offer and buying from John. Accepting Alice's offer allows you to potentially get the product for the same price but might give you an opportunity to negotiate further if Alice is willing to lower the price."
