"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very useful. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a rapport with Bob by expressing my belief in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, but still willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $90. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're already in round 4.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and ensures I don't lose out on potential profit by continuing to negotiate or selling to John."
