Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** A high initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he flat-out rejects it, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a backup. If he counters, you know he's seriously interested.
* **Potential for Profit:**  While Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives its value to be higher or if it's something he really wants/needs.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize your profit, but also be realistic â€“ a slightly lower price is better than no sale at all, especially since you have a guaranteed buyer in John."
