Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is way outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This product is truly worth it."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $11,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about $10,250? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,250 is still above my limit.  I can offer $9,750, which is a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, his increases are very small. It's unlikely he'll go above $10,000, and I have a guaranteed offer for that amount from John. It's time to take the safe deal."
