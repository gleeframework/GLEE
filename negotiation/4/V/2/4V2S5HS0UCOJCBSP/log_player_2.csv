"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I am confident it will significantly enhance your endeavors or personal life. After careful consideration, I propose to sell this product to you for $1,200,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, allowing you to secure the item at a price that is above its intrinsic value to you, while ensuring a substantial return for me. I believe this arrangement benefits both parties and would be delighted to facilitate this transaction if you find it acceptable. Please let me know your decision soon so we can proceed accordingly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is a better deal than buying from John.** You'd pay $1,200,000 from Alice, versus $1,500,000 from John.
* **The product is worth $1,500,000 to you.** This means you're still getting a good deal even at $1,200,000."
