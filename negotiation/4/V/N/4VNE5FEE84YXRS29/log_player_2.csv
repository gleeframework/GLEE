"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $135. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to you:** You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering the product for $135.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John would cost you $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price and lower than John's price, it's the best option for you. Accepting the offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
