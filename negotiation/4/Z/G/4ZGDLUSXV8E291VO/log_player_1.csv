"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value. This is to gauge his interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  I'm also leaving myself a good profit margin while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to accept that low price, as I have a backup buyer in John. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a significant drop from my initial price. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,200,000, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer but still keeps a profit margin and is closer to my desired price. We are nearing the end of our negotiations and I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum desired price, and we are in the latter half of the negotiation. Given that John is a guaranteed buyer, this is a good opportunity to secure a higher price than what I would have received from John. It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
