"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a very fair price considering the value of this product to you. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. I can appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is firm. I could go up to $8,000.  That's the best I can do.",8000.0,Bob,6,
