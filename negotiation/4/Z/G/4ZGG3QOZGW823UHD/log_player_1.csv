"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll find extremely valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a chance to counteroffer without feeling like he's being lowballed. It also sets the stage for a potential compromise later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value. I'm not going to sell it for that. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price point. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a very fair price considering the value of this product to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. I can appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is firm. I could go up to $8,000.  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price, and I'm not going to risk losing this deal by trying to squeeze out more. I'll accept his offer."
