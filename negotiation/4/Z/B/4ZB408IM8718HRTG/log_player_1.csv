"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly from $11,000 to $10,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $9,000, but I believe it's a fair compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I am willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss. I believe I can still secure a better price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm further lowering my offer to $9,750. This shows commitment to a deal while still maintaining a profit. I'm hoping this small compromise will be enough to entice Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects again, I'll likely need to consider selling to John in the next round to avoid losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,600 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not getting any deal at all becomes greater. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit, albeit a smaller one than I initially hoped for.  Selling to John at this point would be the best financial outcome, but the risk of not closing any deal in the remaining rounds outweighs the potential for a higher price."
