"Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you placed on the product. Let's close this deal, I'm confident it will be beneficial for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This price allows us both to get a fair deal and close this transaction.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,875. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this happen!",10875.0,Alice,5,
