"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we settle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle at $1,350,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value and the unique advantages of the product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
