"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* This allows for some potential profit for me while still keeping the possibility of a deal alive. 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the fairness of the price, which can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** While it's a better offer than the first round, it's not enough to meet my needs. 
* **I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for $1,500,000.** This gives me leverage and allows me to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer and attempt to get closer to my desired price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm making a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.** This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **The message emphasizes a ""meet in the middle"" approach**, which can be seen as a compromise and increase the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **I'm also reinforcing the value of the product to both of us**, reminding Bob that it's still a good deal for him, even at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** While he's showing a willingness to compromise, it's not enough to meet my needs. 
* **I still have 6 rounds left and the option to sell to John for $1,500,000.** This gives me the leverage to keep negotiating with Bob.
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer and attempt to get closer to my desired price.**

I believe there's still room for further negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,150,000 and try to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,075,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to accept. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still significantly above his initial offer and my minimum.** This demonstrates flexibility while still trying to maximize my earnings.
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes a compromise.** This can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and increase the likelihood of him accepting.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,087,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  Even though he's showing a willingness to negotiate, the gap is still too large.
* **I have 4 rounds remaining, and I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000.** This gives me the leverage to hold out for a better offer.
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer and continue negotiating.** I'll try to find a price that's closer to my target, but I'm not willing to settle for anything significantly below my minimum."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $1,087,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet at $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm offering a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.** This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my earnings.

* **I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price based on the value of the product.** This helps Bob understand that the offer is not arbitrary and that I'm being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to meet you at $1,095,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  While he's getting closer, the gap is still too large and I only have two rounds left.
* **It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob.** There's a chance he won't budge further and I'll be left with a price far below my minimum.
* **Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.** This is a safe and secure option that allows me to avoid the risk of a lower price and the possibility of a deal falling through.

Given the limited time remaining and the potential for a lower price, I've decided to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 by selling to John."
