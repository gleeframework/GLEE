Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible. 
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, and you value it at $1,000,000+. There's a potential negotiation space.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and close to your guaranteed offer.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other options,"" you introduce a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
