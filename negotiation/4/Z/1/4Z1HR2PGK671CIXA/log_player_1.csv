Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a fair price considering it's worth $120 to both of us, and it gives me a little extra profit.  If he rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $120. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $125. This is a fair compromise, as it's halfway between my original offer and his counteroffer. I'm still hoping to get a little more than my minimum, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not going to continue negotiating down further. I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $120."
