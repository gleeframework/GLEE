"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $75, which would be $82.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'd like to propose $80. Would you be willing to accept that price?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $85, Bob. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. Would you be willing to meet me at $85?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've already made my best offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $80. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",80.0,Bob,6,
