"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny! Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could you consider $12,500?  That's a significant increase from my last offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. But $12,500 is still too far off from what I need. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $14,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this negotiation is taking a while!  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but $13,250 just won't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop my price to $13,500. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's get this done.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to come down a little more.  How about $13,000? That's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,8,
