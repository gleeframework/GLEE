"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value and leaves room for you to profit significantly.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still allows for a good profit margin for both of us. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a good compromise that still allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
