"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer and allows me to find a mutually beneficial price within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob. There's a chance he might be willing to increase his offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While selling to John guarantees $12,000, there's a possibility of securing a higher price from Bob. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  My counteroffer of $8,500 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my starting price, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why my price is fair.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone to encourage continued negotiation.

By offering a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $7,250 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There are still 6 rounds left to negotiate, and Bob's offer shows he's willing to compromise. I believe there's still room to get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for a higher price:** While selling to John guarantees $12,000, I'm aiming to maximize my earnings. If I can get Bob to increase his offer further, I can earn more. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him.  I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price while still remaining open to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $7,250 is still a bit low for me. How about we try $8,000? This would be a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my desired price:** $8,000 is closer to my ideal price of $12,000, while still leaving room for compromise.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Positive and open tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging continued negotiation. 

By offering a counteroffer that's more in line with my target price, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about achieving a mutually beneficial agreement, while leaving room for potential compromise in the remaining rounds."
