"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get a unique item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $120 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can meet you in the middle at $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm very interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, $95 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $110 is too much. How about we split the difference again and go with $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us and we could close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I've already made a concession by offering it to you at $110, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $105 again, but that's as low as I can go.",105.0,Alice,7,
