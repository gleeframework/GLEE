# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a truly unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still outside your comfort zone. There's still room for negotiation and you don't want to risk losing a better deal with John. You can make a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your need for a profit, $1,000,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go to $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $850000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your comfort zone.  While you could continue negotiating, it's getting close to your maximum budget, and you risk a long negotiation that might not result in a better offer.  Buying from John at $800,000 is a guaranteed deal that saves you money and avoids further haggling."
