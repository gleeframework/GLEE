"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, valued at $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using some sales tactics by inflating the perceived value to you ($15,000).  While her offer of $13,500 is lower than your maximum, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
