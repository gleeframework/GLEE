"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to do $125?  That's the absolute highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you coming down a bit, but $137.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $132.50, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product!

Even though this is getting close, Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is still above his maximum budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $132.50 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $131?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 131}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $132, Bob. I think this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $150.  With only a few rounds left, it's becoming riskier to continue negotiating.  At this point, it's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $150 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
