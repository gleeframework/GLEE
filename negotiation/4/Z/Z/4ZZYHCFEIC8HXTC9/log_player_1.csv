"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable, and I'm offering it to you first.  I'm thinking a starting price of $2,000,000 feels fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This offer will help gauge how interested Bob is and how he values the product. His response will give you insight into his negotiation strategy.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer. This gives you leverage to walk away from the negotiation if it's not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what John is offering. You have room to negotiate and try to get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but that offer is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility but Hold Firm:** You're acknowledging Bob's offer but also signaling that you're willing to negotiate.  
* **Strategic Counter:** Meeting halfway between your previous offer ($2,000,000) and his ($1,400,000) shows a willingness to compromise but keeps you above John's offer.
* **Highlight Value:** Reiterate the product's value to reinforce its worth beyond just a price tag."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1,700,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,550,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now $50,000 higher than John's offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has the potential for a higher price, but also the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting secures a profitable deal. 
* **Time Value:**  While you have rounds remaining, closing the deal sooner rather than later has its own value."
