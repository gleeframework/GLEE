Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not quite. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go while still covering my costs.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000.  It's better to buy from John for $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiation."
