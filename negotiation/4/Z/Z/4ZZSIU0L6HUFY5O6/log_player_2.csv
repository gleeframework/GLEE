Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling firmness:** Her language (""final offer"") suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Savings are good:**  You're getting a $1,900 discount from John's price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you push further, Alice might walk away, and you'll have to settle for John's higher price."
