"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering me for this product. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
