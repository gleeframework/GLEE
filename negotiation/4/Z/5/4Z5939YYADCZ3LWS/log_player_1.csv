Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $90."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($100) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves a little room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially increasing your profit slightly. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so there's no risk of getting stuck with the product. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup plan."
