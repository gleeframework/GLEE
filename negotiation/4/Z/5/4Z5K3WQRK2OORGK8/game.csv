"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you coming down, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
