Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum acceptable price. I'll be watching closely to see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can push for a higher amount.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to give away too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me to accept.  I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and I'll get my minimum acceptable price from him.  It's time to stop negotiating with Bob and move on to the sure thing."
