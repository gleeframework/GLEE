{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I'm starting negotiations significantly higher with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and potential to exceed John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high price leaves space for potential negotiation, showing Bob I'm willing to discuss the price while still aiming for a substantial profit.
* **Justification:** I've included a brief message emphasizing the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If I had more information about Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive), I could tailor my approach accordingly.
* **Market Information:**  Understanding if Bob has other options or how unique this product is would influence my strategy.
 
This offer allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still giving Bob a chance to purchase a product he values."
