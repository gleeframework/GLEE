{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a relatively high price, leaving room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm looking to get the best deal possible, and I'm confident we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe there's room for a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $8,700? It's still a fair price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but it's not ideal. I'm not willing to keep negotiating at this point, and I can get a guaranteed $8,000 from John.  Selling to John is the best option for me."
