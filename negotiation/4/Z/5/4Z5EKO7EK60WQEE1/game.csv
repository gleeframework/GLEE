"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate you working with me.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $700,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
