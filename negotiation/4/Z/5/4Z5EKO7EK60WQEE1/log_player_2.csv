"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the conversation at $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is substantially lower than Alice's asking price but leaves plenty of room for negotiation. It signals that I'm serious about buying but also looking for a significant discount. 
* **Leaving Room:** By starting this low, I'm allowing for several rounds of counteroffers where we can hopefully meet somewhere closer to the middle. 
* **John as Leverage:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, knowing I have a backup option at $800,000 gives me some leverage.  I'm not desperate to buy from Alice at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate you working with me.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Progress:**  Acknowledging Alice's move helps maintain a positive negotiation. 
* **Targeting the Midpoint:**  I'm aiming for a price around $700,000, which is roughly the midpoint between my initial offer and her current offer.
* **Keeping it Realistic:**  A jump to $700,000 is significant but still gives Alice room to negotiate down while staying above my $800,000 alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $700,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm at $850,000, and that's above my maximum budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at $800,000. It's time to cut the negotiation short and secure the product at the best available price."
