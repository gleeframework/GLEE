# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product, which I believe you'll find highly valuable. Given its worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'd like to sell it to you for $900,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics by mentioning your potential valuation of $1,000,000, her offer of $900,000 is still a significant savings of $100,000 compared to buying from John."
