Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12,000. I can see that you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to prioritize my own needs. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $11,000, and even if she does, the savings won't be worth the additional rounds of negotiation. You have a guaranteed offer for $10,000 from John, which meets your needs."
