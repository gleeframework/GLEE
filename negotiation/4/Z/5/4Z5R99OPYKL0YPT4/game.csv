"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I can see this product is important to you, and I respect that.  How about we settle at $10,750?  That's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12,000. I can see that you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to prioritize my own needs. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
