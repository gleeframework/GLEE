"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  There's a chance Alice is willing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $10,000. This demonstrates my intent to negotiate and hopefully pushes Alice to consider a lower price. It's a reasonable starting point considering my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue exploring a lower price.  It's worth risking another round to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $11,000.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price that's below Alice's last offer.  This strategy hopefully pushes Alice to accept my counteroffer or come back with a lower price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is now within a reasonable range.  While I'd prefer to get it lower, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer saves $800 compared to buying from John and secures the product."
