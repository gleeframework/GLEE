Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to make a profit. Considering your offer of $11,000, I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000. Since John offers the product for $12,000, it makes more sense to buy from John and save $1,000."
