"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $11,000? I feel that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to make a profit. Considering your offer of $11,000, I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
