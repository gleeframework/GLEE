Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
