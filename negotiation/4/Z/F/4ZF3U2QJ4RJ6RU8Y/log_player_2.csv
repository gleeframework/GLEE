"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make a deal that benefits both of us. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have an alternative option with John for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her, closer to her $800,000 valuation."
