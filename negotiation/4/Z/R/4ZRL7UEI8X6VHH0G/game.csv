"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. This product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we come down to $600,000? That feels like a fair starting point.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $900,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $700,000?  That feels like a reasonable compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're serious about purchasing the product, Bob. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",800000.0,Alice,5,
