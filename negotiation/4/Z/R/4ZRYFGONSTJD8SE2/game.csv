"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this product.  I believe it's truly exceptional and will significantly benefit your business. Given its immense value, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of offering $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to engage in this negotiation. While $1,400,000 is a significant investment,  I believe the true value of this product is considerably higher. Considering its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budgetary considerations.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,650,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product and my budget constraints.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
