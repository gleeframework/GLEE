"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob is willing to pay, but not so high that it seems unreasonable. 
* **Strong Opening:** I'm using a strong message that highlights the value of the product and the opportunity for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While I'm starting high, I'm leaving the door open for negotiation, which is important for the long game.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired $1,000,000 mark. However, if Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to adjust my strategy and be willing to lower the price, but not below my $1,000,000 floor.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option, which gives me more leverage in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired $1,000,000 floor. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a price closer to my target. I believe there's still room for a deal that benefits both of us. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round. My goal is to meet him halfway and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll also keep in mind the possibility of selling to John as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant discount from my original asking price.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Compromise:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise, but also highlighting the significant discount I'm offering. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiations moving forward.

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering with a slightly lower price, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. This might encourage him to come closer to my desired price in the next round. I'm also reminding him of the potential value of the product and the opportunity it represents.  I'm ready to adjust my strategy if needed, and I'm keeping John as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not ready to sell for less than that, especially since I know John is willing to pay my full asking price.

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round. I'll try to meet him halfway again, aiming for a price that's closer to my target but still acceptable to Bob.  I'm also keeping a close eye on the number of rounds remaining and will be prepared to sell to John if it looks like I can't reach a deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding a solution, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is a very fair price considering the value of this product. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again showing willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway, but this time only halfway between my previous offer and his. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of my offer by highlighting the value of the product.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly suggesting that this might be my final offer by saying ""Let's work together to make this happen.""

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer aims to push Bob closer to my target price. By showing continued flexibility while maintaining a firm stance, I hope to create pressure for Bob to accept a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm still prepared to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $960,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Is this a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $960,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a little more.  I have a few rounds left and believe I can still push for a slightly better deal.  John is also a strong backup option, giving me leverage in these negotiations.

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round. I'll try to meet him halfway one more time, aiming for a final price of $965,000.  This would allow me to get closer to my goal without risking losing the deal entirely.  However, if Bob continues to refuse to budge, I will likely sell to John in the final round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $960,000 is a very good offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  Let's close this deal at $965,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm clearly stating that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Call to Action:** I'm directly asking Bob for his decision, prompting him to make a choice.

**Strategy:**

This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a price closer to my goal. If he rejects, I'll likely sell to John in the next round. I'm taking a chance, but with only three rounds left, I need to be bold and push for the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $955,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're in the final stretch of negotiations, and Bob's final offer of $955,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to try and push for a higher price in the last two rounds, the risk is too high.  If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll have no option but to sell to John, and I'll likely end up with a lower price than I could get right now. 

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I guarantee myself a profit of $1,000,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the most logical decision given the circumstances.  I've already pushed Bob to his limit, and there's no guarantee I can get a better price in the remaining rounds.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
