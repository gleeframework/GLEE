Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
