Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase my product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 2200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always wise to start negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of the product's high value. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial offer acts as an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's above his perceived value, it sets a reference point for further negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting so high, you signal to Bob that you're willing to negotiate and potentially meet him somewhere in the middle. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a slight increase from his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and even John's standing offer. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Continue Negotiation:**  There's still a substantial gap to bridge, but it's not impossible. By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about a higher price and open to further discussion.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Accepting such a low offer early on would weaken your position. Rejecting demonstrates your value and willingness to walk away if necessary. 

You'll need to significantly counter Bob's offer in the next round to guide the negotiation towards a more acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the  returns it can generate. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the immense value and benefits you'll be receiving."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  Dropping by $300,000 might seem like a lot, but it serves two purposes:
    * **Demonstrates Flexibility:**  It shows Bob you're willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
    * **Maintains a Strong Position:**  The new price is still significantly higher than his offer, reinforcing the product's value.

* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""returns"" and ""benefits,"" you're shifting the focus from the initial price to the long-term value the product offers.

This counteroffer aims to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation while pushing the price closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased, but his increments are too small, and he's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. It's clear that:

* **Large Gap:** The difference between what you value the product at and what Bob is willing to pay is substantial.
* **Slow Progress:**  Bob's counteroffers are not moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement quickly enough.

Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of:

* **Wasting Time:** You could miss out on selling to John while chasing an unlikely outcome with Bob. 
* **Setting a Precedent:**  Accepting a low offer from Bob could hurt your negotiating position with future buyers. 

Therefore, it's strategically advantageous to accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000, securing your minimum desired profit."
