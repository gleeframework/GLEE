"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000. This product is worth $10,000 to you, so I think this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
