Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $20 markup is a reasonable starting point. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **First Refusal Tactic:**  Highlighting that Bob has the first opportunity to buy can sometimes increase their perceived value of the product. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always propose a lower price, eventually going down to $100 if needed."
