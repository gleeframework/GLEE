"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer, and shows how serious I am about buying this product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're serious about buying the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,000, which is $9,750. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I can tell you're invested in this, and frankly I'm very close to meeting your price.  One last offer: $9,250.  That's me moving substantially from my previous offer, and shows I'm ready to make a deal today.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $9,250, which is $9,500. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value. Let's make a deal!",9500.0,Alice,7,
