"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, but not too high. I want to see if Bob is willing to bite. If not, we can negotiate down. If he's not interested at all, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I need to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? It's still a great deal for you considering what it's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm willing to risk another round to try and get closer to $150.  If Bob doesn't budge, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $140 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $135. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is getting close to my minimum. While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  It's a good compromise and I'll accept it."
