"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? It's still a great deal for you considering what it's worth to me.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $140 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $135. Can you consider that?",135.0,Bob,6,
