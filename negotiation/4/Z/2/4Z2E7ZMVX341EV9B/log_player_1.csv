""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment at $1,190,000.  What do you think?"",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for my minimum price, there's potential to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,190,000) makes it highly appealing to Bob. It's a substantial saving for him compared to his perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys exclusivity and value, subtly encouraging Bob to accept the deal."
