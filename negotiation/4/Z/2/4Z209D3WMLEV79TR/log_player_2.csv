"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth while also being fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to save a substantial amount. 
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for the lower price (budget constraints), hoping to make it more palatable to Alice.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for further discussion, suggesting a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm unable to accept $950,000.  It's simply too far below my asking price. Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above his maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating, aiming to get a better price. He might be able to secure a deal closer to his target of $1,000,000 if he can convince Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is my absolute limit, but I believe it's a fair price given the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob presents his final offer, highlighting its fairness and his limited budget. 
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is direct, leaving no room for misinterpretation.
* **Pressure:** This final offer puts pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal."
