"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price given its value to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay and its exact value to her. There's no room for negotiation or a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down on the price.  You're taking a small risk since you have John as a backup at the same price."
