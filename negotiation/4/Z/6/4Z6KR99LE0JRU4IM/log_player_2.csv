"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would still give you a great deal, and it would be a fair compromise for me. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000.  This is a better price than John's offer, and it's closer to Bob's desired price of $13,000.  It's a good compromise for both parties."
