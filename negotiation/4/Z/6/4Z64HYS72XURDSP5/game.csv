"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to consider my own interests as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,750. It's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to finalize this deal. What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $8,625. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me halfway. What do you think?",8625.0,Alice,5,
