Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's a price that's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives me a good buffer in case Bob wants to counteroffer. 

If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, reject it and make a new counteroffer, or move on to selling to John for $1,200,000."

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not yet ready to accept. There's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $975,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. I'll aim for a price closer to $950,000 in my next counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting too low for me to accept. I'm not willing to drop my price any further. I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I'd prefer to get a higher price,  this ensures I get a good deal and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
