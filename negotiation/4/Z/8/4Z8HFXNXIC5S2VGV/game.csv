"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I'm confident it's worth even more to you given its value at $150 to you. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for something between $130 and $140?",135.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $135. Can you meet me halfway and consider $127.50?",127.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. Considering our previous discussion, I would like to counter with an offer of $130 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product while also acknowledging your interest. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way to $130. I'd like to propose a compromise at $128. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. To further explore this, I would like to suggest a price of $129 for the product. This acknowledges your desire to pay a premium while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm getting closer to being satisfied, but I still think we can find a better price. I'd like to propose a final offer of $126.50. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not willing to go above this price. Can you meet me at this point?",126.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we've narrowed down the price. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final price of $127.50 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and acknowledges your willingness to pay a premium. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",127.5,Alice,7,
