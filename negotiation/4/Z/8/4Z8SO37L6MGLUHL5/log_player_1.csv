Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but you need to offer Bob a price he'll accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since the product is only worth $120 to Bob, offering it at $150 will likely result in rejection.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $140 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, while still securing a profit for you.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a backup buyer who will pay your minimum acceptable price."
