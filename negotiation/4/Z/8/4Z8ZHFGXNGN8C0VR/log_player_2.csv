"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant price point that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, her offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly cheaper than John's $1,500,000 price.
* **You're still getting a good deal.** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,250,000.  This means you're saving $250,000."
