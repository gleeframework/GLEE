"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1400000 for the product.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1350000 for the product, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1320000, which is a slight increase from your last offer. I believe this price is still a good compromise and reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
