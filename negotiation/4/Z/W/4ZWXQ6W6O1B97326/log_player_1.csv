Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price. It also signals that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I'll try to get a bit more by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a price of $135, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell for his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit higher than my minimum, but I'm not sure I'll get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer to avoid the risk of losing a sale and potentially ending up with John's offer of $120."
