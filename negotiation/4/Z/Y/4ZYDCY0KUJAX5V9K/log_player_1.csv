Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price of $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle, while still ensuring a significant profit for me. 
* **Strong but Fair:** The message positions the price as fair, emphasizing the value to Bob. This makes it more likely he'll accept without pushing for a lower price.

**Backup:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm still guaranteed to sell the product to John for $12,000."
