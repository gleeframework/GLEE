Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'll need to see how he responds before deciding whether to push harder or settle for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, so it's best to accept and avoid further negotiations. There's no need to risk a counteroffer that could lead to a lower price or a breakdown in negotiations."
