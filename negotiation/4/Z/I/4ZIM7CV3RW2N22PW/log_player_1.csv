Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

I'm starting the negotiation at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims for a price that's beneficial for both of us. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still striving for a higher profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $107.50 is a reasonable outcome. It surpasses my minimum selling price and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
