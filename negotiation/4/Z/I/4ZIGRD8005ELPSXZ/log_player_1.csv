"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a high initial offer allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Bob's interest level. While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's important to aim high in the initial stages."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While selling to John for $150 is tempting, I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $80 is significantly below its true value.  I could come down to $170 for you.  I think that's a fair offer considering its quality."", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:** I'm lowering my price to show willingness to negotiate but still staying significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $120 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there. I'm willing to negotiate a little further, but I'm also conscious that I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a reasonable price.  How about $155? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 155}

**Reasoning:** I'm coming down to $155, which is just above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling but not willing to go below my lowest acceptable price.  Making it my ""final offer"" adds a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. He's consistently stayed below $150, and I've already signaled my lowest acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
