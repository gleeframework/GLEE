Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower. Accepting her offer at $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, saving $2,000 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
