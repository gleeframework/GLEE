"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway and offer $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $11,500 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I can offer you $13,500 for the product, but I need to know you're serious about making a deal today.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, and I'm serious about making a deal. How about we split the difference and agree on $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can meet you at $13,250, which is just $25 above your last offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close.  I'm willing to go up slightly, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500?  That's my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
