"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This represents a significant step toward your asking price, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, holding out for the full $1,200,000 from John is the best decision. Each round is eating into potential profits if an agreement with Bob drags out."
