Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first since I think you'll find a lot of value from it. I'm asking for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and maximizes the potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob counters, there's a good chance of settling on a price higher than $120.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can lower the price slightly, knowing she has a guaranteed sale at a minimum of $120."
