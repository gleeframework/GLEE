"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds significant value to me, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to both of us, I am offering it to you for $11,500. I trust this price reflects the true value of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I look forward to your positive response and the chance to facilitate this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $12,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to:

* **Negotiate a better price:** Alice might be willing to lower her price slightly to avoid losing the sale. 
* **Stick with John:** If Alice doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything and can buy from John as planned.

It's worth seeing if you can save an extra $500 before resorting to your backup option."
