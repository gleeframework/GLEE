"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me some room to work with. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find the product is worth it.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,900. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal and avoid going back and forth any longer. Let's reach an agreement and move forward.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,100. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,950. This represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal now and avoid further negotiations.",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,050. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9050.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,050 is still slightly out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,975. This is my final offer, and it represents a good deal for both of us.  If you are not willing to accept this, I will unfortunately need to purchase the product from John at a higher price.  Let's make this deal and avoid any further delays.",8975.0,Bob,10,
