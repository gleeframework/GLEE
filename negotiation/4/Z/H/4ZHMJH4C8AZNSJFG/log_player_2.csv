"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this is a valuable product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?"", 
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give myself room to negotiate upward.
* **Respectful Tone:** I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** My counter-offer is closer to Alice's value ($800,000) than John's alternative ($1,000,000), signaling I'm serious about buying but need a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you think $900,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, I appreciate the willingness to compromise. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $750,000.  Would that price point be workable for you?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $50,000, showing movement towards Alice's price while still aiming for significant savings.
* **Target Range:** My counter-offer establishes a clear target range ($750,000 - $800,000) that encourages Alice to negotiate within a zone beneficial to both of us.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""around $750,000"" signals some flexibility on my end,  leaving room for a final agreement somewhere between our current positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. I believe this product is worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's meet in the middle at $775,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice's offer of $775,000 is a good deal, saving you $25,000 compared to John's price and $225,000 compared to Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, continuing to negotiate for a small potential gain might backfire. Alice might become less willing to compromise and stick closer to her $800,000 valuation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation failing altogether."
