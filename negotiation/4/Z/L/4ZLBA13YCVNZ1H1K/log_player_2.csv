"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $1,000. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate. This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget, so he's not risking too much by starting with a more aggressive stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. Bob wants to see if Alice is willing to come down further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a smaller counteroffer, increasing his offer by $250 from the previous round. This shows Alice that he is willing to compromise but is still looking for a better deal. This counteroffer is also a good midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, making it a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now come down to $8,900, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $8,750. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small changes. Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product at a good price and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer.  There's also a chance Alice might even reject his counteroffer and go back up in price.  At this point, it's better to lock in the deal."
