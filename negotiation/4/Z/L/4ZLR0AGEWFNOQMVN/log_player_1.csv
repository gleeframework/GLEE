Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the impression that the product is highly valuable.
* **Knowing Your Alternatives:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000.  This means you don't need to accept any offer below that amount.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $20,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.

**Important Note:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice doesn't.  This is typical of real-world negotiations where each party has their own perception of value."
