"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $140 is close to my maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get the price down further before considering accepting or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. By starting lower, I increase the likelihood of reaching a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price ($120) while staying well within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $125, which is a reasonable compromise and a good price compared to John's offer.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and further haggling might risk losing the deal."
