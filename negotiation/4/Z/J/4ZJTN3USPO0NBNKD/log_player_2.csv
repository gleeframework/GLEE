"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting price is way above your budget and even its actual value to her. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a low number first, you might influence Alice's perception of what's reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  You've signaled that you're flexible by using phrases like ""around"" and ""what do you think?"". This leaves space for a counteroffer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our absolute limit and her product valuation. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This offer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but holds firm below your $10,000 limit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $9,500 is just above the midpoint between your previous offer and her current one, signaling willingness to compromise but not capitulate.
* **Simple and Direct:**  The offer is clear and avoids unnecessary justifications, putting the ball back in Alice's court."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500, so I'm offering it to you for $10,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and she's still above your maximum budget. You can get the product for a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so it makes sense to take that offer now."
