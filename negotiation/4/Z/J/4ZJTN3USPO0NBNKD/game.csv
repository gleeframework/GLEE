"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500, so I'm offering it to you for $10,750. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
