"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $775000. Can you consider this revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $812500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a compromise. I'm offering $790000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",790000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $790000 is still not enough to meet my minimum expectations. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to find common ground. I'm counteroffering at $810000, which is the closest I can get to my target price. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",810000.0,Alice,7,
