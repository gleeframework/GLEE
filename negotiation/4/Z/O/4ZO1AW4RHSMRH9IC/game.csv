"Alice,  $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,425,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,375,000 for the product. This is a fair price that's almost at your offer and closer to my budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal!",1375000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution, but $1,375,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a reasonable compromise.  Let's finalize this deal at this price and move forward.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
