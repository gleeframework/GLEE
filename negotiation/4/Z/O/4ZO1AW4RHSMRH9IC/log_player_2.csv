"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still a significant savings for you. Let's work together to make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price.  It's in his best interest to see if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice to come down further. There's still room for negotiation, and he can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,425,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than before, it's still above his target of $1,000,000. He can still potentially get a better deal with Alice by continuing to negotiate or go with John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,375,000 for the product. This is a fair price that's almost at your offer and closer to my budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution, but $1,375,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a reasonable compromise.  Let's finalize this deal at this price and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is getting close to his target price of $1,000,000 but Alice is still holding out for a higher price. Given that there are only a few rounds left, Bob should make the safe bet and buy from John. There's no guarantee he can negotiate further with Alice, and he's already spent several rounds without a clear path to a better deal.  It's time to secure the product and minimize the risk."
