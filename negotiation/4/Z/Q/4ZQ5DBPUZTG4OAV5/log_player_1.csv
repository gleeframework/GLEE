Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price, as it's less than what the product is worth to him but still higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise from my previous offer and still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his price point. I believe this is a fair offer that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's also likely that if I reject his offer, we'll be stuck in a loop of counteroffers, and I might risk losing the sale to another buyer.  It's best to accept his offer and secure the sale."
