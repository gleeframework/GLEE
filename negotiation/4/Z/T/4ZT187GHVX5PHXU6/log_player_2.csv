**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to you ($9,500 vs. $8,000).**  You can get a better deal.
* **John's offer is your upper limit.** You're willing to pay $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate further with John or potentially find another seller."
