Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we try $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's not worth haggling with Alice any further. She's unlikely to go much lower than $10,500, and you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  You'll save $500 by going with John."
