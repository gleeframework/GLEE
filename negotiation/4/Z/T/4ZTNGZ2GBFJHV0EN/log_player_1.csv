"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm testing the waters with a price that's well above my minimum.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."

Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial price, but it's still above my minimum. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
