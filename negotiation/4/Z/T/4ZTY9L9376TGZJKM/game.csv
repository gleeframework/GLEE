"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a great starting point and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle.  How about we settle at $760,000? That's a reasonable compromise, I think.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $760,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $795,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer and I see you're willing to be reasonable.  To be respectful of your time, I can do $780,000.  This is my final offer.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $790,000. This is as close to my minimum as I can get. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,7,
