Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $85, which is still higher than what Bob offered but closer to my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer and I risk losing the sale to John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I sell the product and earn my minimum profit."
