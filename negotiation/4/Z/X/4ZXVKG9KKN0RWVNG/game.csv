"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,500?  That's a good price for both of us, and it leaves some room for a win-win situation.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit shy of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $9,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit higher.  How about $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do right now. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,
