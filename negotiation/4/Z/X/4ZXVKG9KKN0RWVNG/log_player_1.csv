``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still attractive enough for him to consider.  It also leaves room for negotiation.  I can then adjust my counteroffers depending on his response and whether I feel I'm getting closer to my target of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a compromise that's closer to my target price.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $8,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,500?  That's a good price for both of us, and it leaves some room for a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit shy of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's getting closer to my target price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,100.  While it's still below my ideal price of $12,000, it's getting close and it's better than my minimum of $12,000.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay $12,000."
