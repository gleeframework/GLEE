"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $775,000. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $775,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $725,000. Would that be workable?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to drive the price down further. I understand that you're a savvy negotiator, but I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $750,000. I'm offering it to you for $760,000. This is my final concession, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",760000.0,Alice,5,
