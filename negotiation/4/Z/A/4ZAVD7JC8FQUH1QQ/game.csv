"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $500,000.  Would you be willing to consider something in that range?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your target price is $500,000, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $700,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're amenable to that, I'm ready to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $700,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to reach a deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to bump my offer to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go.  Let's make this happen!",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to bump up your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession and offer $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to reach a deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
