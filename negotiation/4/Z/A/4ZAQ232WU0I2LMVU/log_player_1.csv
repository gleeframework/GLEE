Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
