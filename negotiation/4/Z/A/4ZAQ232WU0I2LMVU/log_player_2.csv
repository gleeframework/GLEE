# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects its worth while still making it a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle on $1,150,000? I feel that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to the mark, I can't accept anything less than $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

It's time to cut our losses. Alice seems firm on $1,300,000, and while we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower. John offers a sure thing at $1,200,000.  It's better to save the $100,000 and secure the product from John."
