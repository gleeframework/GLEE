"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,800?  This gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8,200, which would be $8,550. Can we meet at that price?",8550.0,Bob,4,
