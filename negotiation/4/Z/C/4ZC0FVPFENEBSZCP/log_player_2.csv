"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is much higher than both your budget and John's price. It makes sense to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for presenting the product. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) than our actual budget ($120). This gives us room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a better deal than John's $120 offer. 
* **Polite & Interested:**  The message is framed politely to keep the negotiation amicable, and we express continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your backup price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as you won't get a better deal."
