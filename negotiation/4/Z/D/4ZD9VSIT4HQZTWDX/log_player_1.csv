Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $15,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?  It's a fantastic product and well worth the investment."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $16,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $16,000 is a good deal at this point. It's significantly more than Bob initially offered and keeps me from the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
