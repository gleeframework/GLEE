"I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob. However, I've done my research and know that this product is worth a lot more to you than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm serious about buying this product, but I have a firm budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly by offering it to you for $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to land closer to $9,500. To show I'm serious, I'm willing to offer $9,750. This is a fair offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $10,250. This is my last compromise.",10250.0,Alice,7,
