,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $7,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice.  How about we settle at $6,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $6,800. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",6800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I'd be willing to pay $6,600 for the product. This is a fair offer considering its value to me.  What do you say?",6600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,800 and $6,600, which would be $6,700. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise.",6700.0,Alice,7,
