"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This leaves room for both of us to feel like we got a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $950,000, which would be $875,000. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price of $1,000,000.  I'm not yet convinced that Bob is willing to come up to a price that reflects the value of the product.  I'll continue negotiating, but if we don't reach a deal soon, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $875,000 just isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down a little further. I'm proposing a final price of $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $925,000, which would be $900,000. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also running out of time. If Bob doesn't come up to $1,000,000 soon, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be at least at $950,000 to make this deal work.  I'm open to one last compromise.  This is my final offer.  Are you in?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've reached my limit for negotiating with Bob.  We've gone through several rounds and he's unwilling to budge on his price.  I'm not going to accept anything lower than $1,000,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. It's time to move on and secure the sale."
