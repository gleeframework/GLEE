"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This leaves room for both of us to feel like we got a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $950,000, which would be $875,000. Can we meet at that price?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $875,000 just isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down a little further. I'm proposing a final price of $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be at least at $950,000 to make this deal work.  I'm open to one last compromise.  This is my final offer.  Are you in?",950000.0,Alice,7,
