"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the condition of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $100. I hope we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value and condition. Let's make this deal happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate it. However, I still believe $100 is a fair price for the product. Could you consider going down to $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $105 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal.",107.5,Alice,5,
