"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I want to start with a strong opening offer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
