Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to make this offer particularly attractive to ensure a swift deal. Would a price of $1,200,000 be amenable to you?"",
""product_price"": 1200000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming closer to the guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000).
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""unique opportunity"" and ""swift deal"" create a sense of urgency and value, potentially swaying Bob's perception. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning a ""confidential minimum price,"" the offer hints at a higher inherent value without directly stating it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than John's offer, allows for a potential counter-offer. It signals flexibility while maintaining a strong position.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the risk of him rejecting the offer and accepting the guaranteed sale to John."
