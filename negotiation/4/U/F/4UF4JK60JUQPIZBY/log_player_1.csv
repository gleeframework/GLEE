Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $2,000,000. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage. Starting high allows you to potentially secure a significant profit.
* **Time Constraint:** The 24-hour limit creates urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly without overthinking.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message subtly highlights the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:** While I've suggested a price of $2,000,000, you could experiment with even higher amounts depending on your risk tolerance and assessment of Bob's eagerness to buy."
