Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above $13,000.
* **Time Value:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, selling to Bob quickly might be more advantageous than waiting.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $14,000. If a quick sale is highly desirable, a slightly lower initial offer could be considered."
