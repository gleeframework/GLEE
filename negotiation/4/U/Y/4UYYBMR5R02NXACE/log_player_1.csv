Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob is still willing to buy.  Here's why:

* **It's higher than my ""fallback"" price:** This offer is $1,500 more than I would get from John, which is a significant increase in profit. 
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he still has $500 in ""surplus"" value if he accepts this offer. This makes the deal attractive to him.

By offering a price that's slightly above my minimum, I'm increasing my chances of securing a sale with Bob while still benefiting from his higher valuation."
