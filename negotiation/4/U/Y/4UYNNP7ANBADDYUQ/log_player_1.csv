``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. This is the most I can afford while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, I can't go lower than $1,150,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my target price.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  While he's getting closer, it's not enough.
* **I have 6 rounds left.**  I have time to continue negotiating.
* **I can potentially get a better offer from Bob in the next few rounds.**  It's worth pushing a bit further. 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer, aiming to get closer to my target price. If the next few rounds don't lead to a satisfying outcome, I'll consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,125,000 is still quite a bit below my target price.

Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1137500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to make small concessions:** I'm gradually moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a firm stance on my minimum acceptable price.

* **Emphasizing a positive and collaborative tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative approach can help encourage Bob to accept. 

**Considering the Next Steps:** 

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider my options in the next round.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to meet my budget. Based on our previous discussions, I am willing to consider $1,130,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while still keeping me within my financial limits.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still trying to reach a price that reflects the value of the product, but I'm willing to consider $1,135,000. This is a small increase from your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1135000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concessions:** I'm making a small increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to be flexible but not caving in completely.
* **Emphasizing Fair Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a fair compromise that takes into account both our needs. 
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's see if we can close this deal.""  This encourages Bob to make a decision and potentially accept the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully assess my options in the next round.
* I am still committed to getting as close to my target price as possible. If necessary, I'll sell to John in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and am willing to consider $1,132,500 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget constraints.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to the last two rounds.  If I don't accept Bob's offer, there's a strong chance we won't reach an agreement.
* **Close to Bob's perceived value:**  Bob's offer is very close to his perceived value of $1,000,000.  Further negotiations are unlikely to yield a significant increase in price.
* **Guaranteeing my minimum price:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

While I would like to earn even more, it's more important to secure a sale and guarantee my target price.  Selling to John is the safest and most reliable option at this point."
