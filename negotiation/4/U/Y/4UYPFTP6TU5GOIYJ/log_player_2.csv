"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to you, $85 is a good price. However, you can try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, and you can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $85, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to find a price that's fair to both of us, while still saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $90 is closer to my initial offer of $75, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get her down further. I've got several rounds left, and I can always buy from John if this negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $80. This is a compromise between Alice's latest offer of $90 and my previous offer of $75. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Alice to come down to a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is higher than her previous offer of $90. It seems like she is becoming more rigid in her price.  However, I still have 5 rounds left and haven't yet reached my maximum value for the product. I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was $95, which is still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm going to increase my offer to $85, which is right in the middle of her last offer and my previous offer. This shows that I'm willing to meet halfway, and hopefully will convince her to accept.  We're now in the middle of the negotiation, so it's important to show flexibility and good faith to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is closer to my maximum value of $120, but I'm still determined to get a better price.  I have three rounds left, so I'm willing to risk rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate further.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round, and hope to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was $100, which is close to my maximum. I'm increasing my offer to $90, which is a compromise between her last offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Alice to accept. This is my second to last round, so I need to be strategic about reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is very close to my maximum value of $120, but I'm still determined to get a better price.  I only have one round left, so this is my last chance to negotiate with Alice.  I'm going to counter with a lower price in the next round, and hope to reach a mutually agreeable price.  If Alice rejects my offer, I'll be forced to buy from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final round with Alice.  I'm increasing my offer to $95, which is right in the middle of her last offer ($105) and my previous offer ($90). I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Alice to accept.  If she rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to buy from John for $120."
