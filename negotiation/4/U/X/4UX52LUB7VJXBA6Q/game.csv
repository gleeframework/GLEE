"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $107.50? That way we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",107.5,Alice,3,
