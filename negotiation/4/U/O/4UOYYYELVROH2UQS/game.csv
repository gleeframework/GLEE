"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can consider a price of $550,000. I think this is a fair middle ground that meets both of our interests.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I can offer you a compromise at $525,000. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering.",525000.0,Alice,5,
