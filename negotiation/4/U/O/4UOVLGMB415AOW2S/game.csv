"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents my ideal price, I understand there's room for compromise. How about we settle on $1,750,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
