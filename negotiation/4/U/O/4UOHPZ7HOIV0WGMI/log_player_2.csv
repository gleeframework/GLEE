"Round 1

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$15,000 is far too high. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
``` 

Let's start with a significantly lower offer of $7,000. This will give us room to negotiate if Alice rejects."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my target, it's still too high. Let's keep negotiating with Alice to see if we can get closer to my $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

Let's raise our offer to $9,000.  This is a more reasonable compromise, but still gives us some wiggle room if Alice counteroffers again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high. We've already established that she's willing to negotiate, so let's see if we can get closer to our target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
``` 

Let's try to meet Alice halfway with an offer of $10,000.  We're getting closer to her price point, but still within our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While it's tempting to accept Alice's offer, it's still higher than my maximum budget. We're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, so it's worth making one more counteroffer to try and close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

Let's try one more time with a counteroffer of $11,000. It's a reasonable compromise considering Alice's last offer, and it's still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

It's getting down to the wire, and Alice's offer is still too high.  I don't want to risk running out of rounds and being forced to accept a price above my budget.  I'll buy the product from John for $8,000."
