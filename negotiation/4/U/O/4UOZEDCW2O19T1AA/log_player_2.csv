"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident you'd be willing to pay a premium for, given its potential benefits.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a price that allows me to make a fair profit while also ensuring you get a great deal. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John if necessary. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or get the product for your ideal price from John."
