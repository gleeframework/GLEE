,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 105? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's try $95. It's closer to what I can afford and still gives you a good profit.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 95. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 110? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",110.0,Alice,5,
