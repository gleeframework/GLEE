Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  A higher starting point allows for more flexibility during counteroffers.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will pay $1,000,000 provides a fallback option if negotiations with Bob break down. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profits while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value.** I need at least $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile.
* **I have a guaranteed backup option.**  John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so there's no pressure to accept a lower offer from Bob. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially pushing Bob closer to my goal. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and increase the chances of reaching a more profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to save a significant amount compared to my initial offer. Let me know if you're interested in this final price."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight decrease:** I'm  reducing my price by $25,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positioning as a final offer:**  The message highlights this as a ""final price,"" potentially putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Focusing on the value:** I'm emphasizing the savings Bob can still achieve compared to my initial offer.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between being firm on my desired price and leaving room for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you reconsider and meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firm on his $850,000 offer, and I'm unwilling to go below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is significantly more than what Bob is willing to pay.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob might not lead to a higher offer and could waste valuable time.

Selling to John is the most logical choice in this scenario. It ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems unlikely to change his position."
