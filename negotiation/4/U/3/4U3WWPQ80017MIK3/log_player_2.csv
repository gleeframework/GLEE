"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's sure to benefit both of us.  I understand its worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair deal.  Let's discuss a price of $1,450,000. This would be a significant gain for you and a strong return for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so she has some room for negotiation. Buying it from John for $1,500,000 is still a good option, but I can try to get a better deal from Alice.
