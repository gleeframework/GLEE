Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and open to negotiation,  highlighting the value the product holds for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This offer allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** The initial offer is close to my ideal price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The offer is not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition, allowing for a back-and-forth that might lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Secure a fallback option:** By knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000, I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the price down a bit. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1050000.  Let me know your thoughts on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:**  While $1,050,000 is still more than my minimum acceptable price, it's significantly lower than my ideal price and my initial offer.  Rejecting allows me to try and negotiate a better price.
* **Strategy:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,150,000 by counter-offering and engaging in further negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a price that is more favorable for me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows for a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my ideal.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for both of us. I'm aiming to find a ""middle ground"" to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's initial offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell at a lower price.
* **Show flexibility:**  My counteroffer indicates a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on value:** The message reiterates the value of the product to both parties.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this counteroffer, but I'm hoping that this offer will be acceptable to him."
