Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him ($8,000), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, I'm leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer. By moving closer to his desired price, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. I believe this price still gives me a fair profit, while also increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's likely we're nearing the end of negotiation, and further rounds might not yield a significantly better offer. It's more advantageous to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale, rather than risk him walking away or me needing to sell to John for a lower profit."
