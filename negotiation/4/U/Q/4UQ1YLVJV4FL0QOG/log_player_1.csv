Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $140 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $125 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still allows you to make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
