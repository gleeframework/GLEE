Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested parties. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and demand without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" invites Bob to counter-offer, starting the negotiation process.

**Objective:**  The goal is to maximize profit. While Bob's perceived value is $10,000, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as scarce or highly valuable to him for other reasons."
