"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still allow you a substantial gain while ensuring I receive a fair price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is still quite a bit less than what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, to $800,000.
