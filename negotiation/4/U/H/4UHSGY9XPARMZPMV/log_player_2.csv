"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item at a competitive price. Would you like to buy it from me for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she is offering it for $12,000. This means there is room for negotiation. As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.

While $13,000 is closer to my goal than John's $15,000, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still a bit short on the price. I can do $12,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Alice has lowered her price to $12,500, which is a reasonable price for me.  This is a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. I'll accept her offer and move on."
