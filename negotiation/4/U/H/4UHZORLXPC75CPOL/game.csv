"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for what this product delivers. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true value while leaving a comfortable margin for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable compromise. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both parties.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
