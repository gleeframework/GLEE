"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth to both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. You have room to negotiate and are better off aiming higher, even with the risk of losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for what this product delivers. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true value while leaving a comfortable margin for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable compromise. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While closer, Bob's offer is still below your guaranteed sale price with John.  You're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of losing profit.  You'll counter-offer, aiming to meet somewhere above your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both parties."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 
 

At this point, you're offering the product at your absolute minimum but framing it as a win-win.  You're emphasizing fairness and hoping Bob recognizes the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

It's time to cut your losses. Bob is consistently unwilling to meet your minimum price, and while he might eventually go higher, it's not worth the risk. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired minimum, ensuring a clean and profitable deal."
