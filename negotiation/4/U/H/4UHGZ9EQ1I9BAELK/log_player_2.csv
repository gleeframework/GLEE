"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can do better than $11,500.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see we're close on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $11,000, which is lower than John's price of $12,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
