"Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,600,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,450,000 is still a bit outside of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
