"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$80 is a good price, but it's still possible to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore the possibility of a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price. $70 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within Bob's budget.  It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $75, which is a good price considering Bob's limit of $120. It's unlikely that Alice will go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
