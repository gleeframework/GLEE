"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $10,000. This counteroffer is a bit above that, leaving some room for negotiation while still aiming to get a significant discount from the initial $12,000. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price. While $12,500 is closer to your maximum budget of $15,000, there's still room to negotiate. It's better to reject and try to get a lower price. You can aim for a counteroffer closer to your initial offer of $10,500, showing you're serious about a deal but not willing to pay too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is closer to your budget, but it's still higher than you'd like. This counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise - it's a slight increase from your previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit while you save more money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is getting close to your maximum budget, but it's still below the $15,000 you'd pay John. Accepting this offer allows you to save $2,000 compared to buying from John. While it's not the ideal price, it's a good deal considering your goal of saving as much money as possible. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely and being forced to buy from John at a higher cost."
