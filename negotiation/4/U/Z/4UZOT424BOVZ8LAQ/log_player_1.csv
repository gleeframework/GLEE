Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. It also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still confident that I can get a good price for the product.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still above my minimum, and it seems unlikely we'll get much closer to my initial asking price. It's time to secure the deal and take the profit."
