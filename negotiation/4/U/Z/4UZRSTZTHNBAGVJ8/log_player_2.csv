"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore potential lower prices through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, Bob can still aim for a lower price. He's willing to pay less than $800,000 and can likely negotiate further. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to $825,001. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $825,001 is just slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer of $825,000.  Given that Bob is very close to his target price, and there's a chance Alice might not make another concession, it's a good time to accept the offer. Further negotiation could lead to a lower price but might also risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price within his budget."
