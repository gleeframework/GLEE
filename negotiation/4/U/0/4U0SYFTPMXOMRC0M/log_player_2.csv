Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $9,500 is a fair price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems stuck at a price point significantly higher than John's offer. It's unlikely she'll budge enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the best price with the least risk of losing the deal entirely."
