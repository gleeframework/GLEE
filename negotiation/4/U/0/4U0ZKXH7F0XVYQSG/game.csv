"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a starting price of $22,000. I believe it holds significant value, even beyond its price, and would be a valuable asset to you. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let me know if that's a possibility for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle; how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your seriousness about this purchase.  While $10,000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $14,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10,000.  It's the best I can do.",10000.0,Bob,6,
