,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $1350000?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 still feels a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1325000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
