"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $1200000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This would still give you a good deal and ensure a profitable outcome for me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $1250000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $1300000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to pay $1220000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?,1220000.0,Bob,6,
