"Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $90 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $85. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
