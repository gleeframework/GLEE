Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, and I need to be fair to myself. I can offer you a price of $760,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $760,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer is getting very close to John's price. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and there's a risk Alice might increase her price. Accepting the $760,000 offer secures a reasonable deal."
