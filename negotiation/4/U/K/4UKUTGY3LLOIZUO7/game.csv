"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value this product will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While the product is good, $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Could you consider $720,000?",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $720,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $780,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",780000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $780,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $750,000? I think this is a fair offer considering the current market value.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, and I need to be fair to myself. I can offer you a price of $760,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",760000.0,Alice,7,
