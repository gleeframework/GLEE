"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product.  This reflects my initial assessment of its value.  Let me know your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725000 is still a bit high for me.  To show my sincerity, I'm willing to increase my offer to $650000. This represents a good compromise and allows us to make progress.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
