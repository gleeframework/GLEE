Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning that you have other interested buyers (even without explicitly naming John) creates a sense of urgency and competition. 
* **Value Justification:** While not explicitly stating the $12,000 value, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly hints that the price is justified.

This approach aims to maximize profit while still leaving room for a deal that would be acceptable to Bob."
