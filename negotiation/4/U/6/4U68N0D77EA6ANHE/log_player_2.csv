{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still holding out for a higher price. Although I've come down significantly from my initial offer, it's clear we're not going to find a mutually acceptable price. Rather than continuing to negotiate, it's more efficient to buy from John and secure the product for my desired price."
