Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it still allows me to make a considerable profit.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob, highlighting the potential profit he could make by acquiring the product. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to secure a quick deal with Bob while still getting a decent price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give away the product for significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me some leverage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also significantly lower than the value of the product to me.  I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, even though I'm aware of the potential risks of losing the deal. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This gives you a substantial discount while still ensuring a fair deal for me.  Let's find common ground and make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price of $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer of $1,400,000 but still well above Bob's offer. It represents a compromise, but it's important to note that I am still making a profit.
* **Message:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a reasonable compromise, highlighting the value to both of us. I'm emphasizing that this is a fair deal that benefits both parties.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.  I'm still confident I can get a better price than Bob's initial offer, but I'm also open to negotiation to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $750,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than the value of the product to me. I'm not willing to sell it for a price that is so far below what I consider fair.

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000. It's risky to keep negotiating, but I believe there's still room for a better deal. I'm confident I can find a price that works for both of us, without jeopardizing my own financial goals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  This would be a significant gain for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $825,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $750,000.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of the offer, highlighting the substantial gain for Bob while ensuring a fair profit for myself.  
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground and show that I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.  I'm confident that this offer is reasonable and will encourage Bob to accept.

By continuing to negotiate and offer a compromise, I'm hoping to avoid selling to John for the lower price and securing a better deal with Bob."
