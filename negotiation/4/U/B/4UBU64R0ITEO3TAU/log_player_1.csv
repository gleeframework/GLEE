Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly below Bob's perceived value ($800,000) creating a sense of potential gain for him.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The message leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price between $950,000 and $1,000,000.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we haven't lost anything. We proceed with selling to John at our guaranteed price."
