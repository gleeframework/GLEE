"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'll accept $16,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value, and I hope we can agree on it.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a fair price considering I can get it for $15,000 elsewhere. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
