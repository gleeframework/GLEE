"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a lower price, especially since you know the product is worth considerably less to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to meet in the middle of the initial price gap.  It shows Alice you're serious but also unwilling to pay her initial high price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but we can still push for a better price.  Meeting in the middle is a common tactic, but we started much closer to our ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $100 is getting closer. How about $95, and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're nearing a price point where considering John's offer might be prudent. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while applying a bit more pressure."
