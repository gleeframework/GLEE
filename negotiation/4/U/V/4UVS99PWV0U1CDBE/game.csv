"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7500 is simply too low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's make this happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $8250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase. ",8250.0,Bob,4,
