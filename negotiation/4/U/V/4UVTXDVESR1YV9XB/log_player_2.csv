"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a discount. I believe you will find its worth exceeds this investment many times over. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, that price point is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's starting price, but still leaves room for negotiation before reaching John's offer. It also establishes a willingness to pay a reasonable amount, encouraging Alice to continue the bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we agree on a price of $11,500 for the product? This still allows for a reasonable profit while remaining within your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, which is good. However, we're getting close to John's price.  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between our last offer and Alice's latest price. It's a strong position as it's only $500 away from Alice's last counteroffer and a full $1,000 below her original asking price."
