"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,200,000 is above his budget, and he has the option to buy from John for a lower price.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price is fair considering the market value and my current budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the market price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  He can still get the product from John for $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is still higher than that. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,090,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice is not willing to go below $1,090,000, and John is offering the product for $1,000,000.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
