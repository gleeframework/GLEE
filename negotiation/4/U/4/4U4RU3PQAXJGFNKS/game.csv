"Alice, $1800000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800000.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1000000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm ready to close at $950000.  This is my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable going all the way down to $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into finding a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
