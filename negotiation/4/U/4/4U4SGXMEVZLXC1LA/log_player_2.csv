"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's only $1 more than his maximum budget, there's no reason to pay more than necessary, especially when he has a guaranteed alternative with John.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a better price. He's offering $950,000, which is $50,000 less than Alice's offer and still leaves some room for potential negotiation. This aggressive approach might make Alice more willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is significantly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate down to a price that's within Bob's comfort zone. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is the best deal he can get without risking further negotiation."
