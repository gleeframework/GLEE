"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is more than my absolute minimum, it's significantly lower than what I'd like to get for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $170. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum and hopefully closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away or I might run out of rounds. It's a good enough price to avoid selling to John."
