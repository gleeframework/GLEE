Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This is a common tactic in negotiations to leave room for compromise. I believe that Bob, being interested in the product, is likely to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price of $95. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer of $90 to my desired price. I believe this is a fair price that gives us both a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is getting too close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a long negotiation.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a good profit and avoids any potential for further haggling."
