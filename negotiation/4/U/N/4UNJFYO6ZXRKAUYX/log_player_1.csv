Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I'm only able to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly what John is willing to pay. Since I'm guaranteed to get at least $10,000, it's best to accept Bob's offer and close the deal now."
