"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $20,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I appreciate your consideration.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my situation. I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I still cannot meet the price of $17,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15,000. This is the highest amount I can realistically afford while still staying within my budget. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
