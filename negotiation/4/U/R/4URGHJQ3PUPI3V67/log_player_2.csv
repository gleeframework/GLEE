"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a lot to you. Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's a significant margin for negotiation, so it's better to reject and try to get a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so you have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for both of us to make a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price recognizes the value of the product for you and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's work towards an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my budget. While it's a step in the right direction, I need to continue negotiating. There are still rounds available, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This offer is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Let's work together to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This offer reflects a significant concession on my part and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's getting closer, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject and try to get a better price, but I'm starting to get nervous about running out of rounds. It's time to start considering the ""Buy from John"" option as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,450,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate you reaching $1,400,000.  We're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. Given the time constraint, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,475,000. This offer is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,475,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. We are running out of time and there is a risk that Alice will keep counter-offering at higher prices. To avoid this, I will choose to buy the product from John. This guarantees me the product at my budget price and saves time."
