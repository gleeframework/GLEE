"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start high, knowing that I can always go lower.  My goal is to maximize my profit, and I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't reflect the value of the product.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,200,000. I believe $1,100,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still too low for me to accept. I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my asking price, and I'm not going to risk losing that opportunity for a small gain. I'll continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to keep lowering my price, but I'm still trying to get as much as I can. $1,050,000 is a good compromise, and I believe it's a price that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure a sale with John for $1,200,000 than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
