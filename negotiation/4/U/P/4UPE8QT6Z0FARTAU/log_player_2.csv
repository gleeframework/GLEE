"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since Alice is open to it. There's a chance you could get the product for less than $150."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $135? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

While $135 is closer to my limit, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. I'll try one more counteroffer before resorting to John's offer."
