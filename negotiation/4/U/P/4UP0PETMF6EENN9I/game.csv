"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $15000. It's a steal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own needs.  Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9750 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $9750 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations.  I hope we can reach an agreement in this round.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go over $10000, so I'll try one more time. I'm willing to pay $9750 for the product. This is my final offer, so please let me know if we can agree on this price.",9750.0,Bob,8,
