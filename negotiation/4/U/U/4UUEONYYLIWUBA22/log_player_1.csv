Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit above our minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to reinforce the product's worth to Bob.

**Why not higher?:**  While we could try for a higher price, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. This would force us to sell to John for $1,200,000, missing out on potential profit."
