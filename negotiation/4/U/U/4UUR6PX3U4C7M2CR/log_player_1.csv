"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's goal is to maximize profit. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still below her minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  She's willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation in hopes of getting closer to her target price.  Selling to John at this point would guarantee her minimum, but it's not the optimal strategy if she believes she can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1600000. How about $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is Alice's minimum acceptable price. She has reached her goal and there's no further incentive to negotiate.  While she could continue the negotiation, there's a risk that Bob might change his mind or the deal could fall apart. Accepting the offer guarantees Alice her desired profit and avoids any potential complications."
