"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really value. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider my offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly hinting at the product's value to Bob without revealing my own valuation.

This approach aims to get the negotiation started while leaving room for adjustments based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product and would like to discuss a lower price. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** I want to maximize my profit. While $90 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still lower than my initial target.
* **Negotiation Space:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain some bargaining power and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  I'm open to a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I value the product at a bit more than $90, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language like ""fair price"" to encourage acceptance and emphasize the mutual benefit of the deal.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to maintain a sense of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, how about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $92 is only $3 away from my initial offer of $95 and is significantly closer to my target than selling to John for $80. 
* **Limited Time:**  We're already in round 4, and time is running out.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a chance Bob could become more insistent on a lower price, or I might not be able to reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of getting a worse outcome."
