"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the potential value it brings, I'm willing to offer $700000 for it. This reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, considering its worth to me, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also acknowledges your investment. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is closer, but it's still outside my budget.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to offer $775000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and a significant investment on my end. I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to invest in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $810000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $810000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  To demonstrate my serious interest in this product, I'm willing to offer $790000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",790000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $790000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $815000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",815000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're calling this your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.

Let's close this deal now at this price.",800000.0,Bob,8,
