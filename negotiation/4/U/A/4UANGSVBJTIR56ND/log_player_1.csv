"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm dropping the price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower, and I'm worried we're not going to be able to close the deal.  It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
