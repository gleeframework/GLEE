You have three options:

The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is too high. It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

While $17,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before potentially settling for a higher price."
