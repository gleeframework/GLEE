"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. How about we meet at $762,500? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $762,500.

Alice's offer of $762,500 is only $12,500 higher than your last counteroffer of $750,000.  It's a good compromise that saves you $37,500 compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer is the best move to maximize savings."
