Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the high price. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale to John."
