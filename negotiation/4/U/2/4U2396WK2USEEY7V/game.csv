"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. Unfortunately, that price is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm getting closer, but $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,500? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have another offer for a similar product at a lower price. I'd prefer to work with you, but I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree.  Would you consider $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you have another offer on the table, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to hold out for a better price. I'm willing to make one more offer, $9,250. That's my final offer. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,7,
