"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $110 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a little too high for me.  How about we settle on $115? That's a fair compromise, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.",115.0,Bob,4,
