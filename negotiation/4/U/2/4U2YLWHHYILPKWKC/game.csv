"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and it's a good start for me to reach my target price. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I think we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $1,100,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my goal. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1,075,000? This would be a fair price that allows us both to move forward. Let me know your thoughts.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $1,030,000? I think this is the best we can do and still be fair to both of us.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
