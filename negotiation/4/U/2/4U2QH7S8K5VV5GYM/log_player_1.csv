{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some incentive to negotiate, but it's not so high that he'll immediately reject it.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you profit.
* **It's a friendly opening:** The message establishes a good rapport and opens the door for a potential compromise. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation where you can potentially increase the price while remaining within Bob's acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.  While I could sell to John for $15,000, it's still worth exploring if I can get a higher price from Bob.  

Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12,500?  That would be a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.  
* **Reasoning:** I've justified the price with a clear benefit for Bob (fair compromise) and a benefit for me (profit).
* **Open-ended Question:** Ending with a question invites Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This counteroffer is a calculated step towards a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Would you be willing to do $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still not high enough.  I'm determined to get as much as possible for my product.  

Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and gives me a chance to see if I can push for a higher price. If I fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $11,500? This is a final compromise from my side. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm indicating that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or lose the deal.
* **Solid Reasoning:** I've given a concrete reason for the price (""final compromise""). 
* **Alternative Options:** Mentioning other options reminds Bob that I'm not desperate and have other buyers.

This counteroffer is designed to be assertive and potentially close the deal. I'm aiming for a price just above my minimum acceptable price, but if Bob still rejects, I have a fallback option with John."
