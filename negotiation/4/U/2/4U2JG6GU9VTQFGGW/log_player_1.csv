Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down later. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While I know Bob values it at $1,000,000, starting above that creates an opportunity to gauge his interest and potentially uncover a higher willingness to pay than he initially lets on. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  It's important to stay below John's offer of $1,200,000. This ensures I have a profitable fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't pan out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating room for negotiation. While it's closer to John's offer, I believe I can still secure a better deal from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - would you consider $1,275,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down from $1,450,000 to $1,275,000, a significant decrease designed to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to counter.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** By framing this as a compromise, I'm subtly nudging Bob towards a more cooperative mindset.
* **Above Both Values but Below John:**  This price remains above both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,200,000),  while still leaving a gap to close before reaching John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The gap is narrowing, but Bob is still well below my minimum acceptable price.  He's moved up $50,000 while I came down $175,000. It's important to signal that larger concessions are needed from his side. I'm sticking to my guns for now, knowing I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $1,150,000 falls a bit short of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to consider $1,225,000 - it's a firm offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This time I'm only coming down $50,000, mirroring Bob's last move. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but holding my ground.
* **""Firm Offer"" Language:**  I'm setting a clear boundary here.  This isn't a starting point for further haggling - it's a take-it-or-leave-it offer.
* **Justification:**  Rather than just stating a price, I'm reiterating the value proposition to remind Bob why this is worthwhile.
* **Nearing the End Game:**  I'm getting close to my fallback option with John.  If Bob doesn't bite at this price, it might be time to walk away."
