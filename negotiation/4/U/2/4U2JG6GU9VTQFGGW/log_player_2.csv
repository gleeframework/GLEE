# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - would you consider $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  Since you're committed to saving as much money as possible, it's worth continuing negotiations to try and get closer to your target price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $1,150,000 falls a bit short of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to consider $1,225,000 - it's a firm offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still above your maximum budget. While it's closer than her previous offers, it's important to remember your goal: save as much money as possible. 

Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000,  it's more beneficial to go with John's offer and secure the product within your budget. Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and you risk losing out on the product altogether."
