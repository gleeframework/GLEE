"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with this opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good strategy to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While starting high, we don't want to be unreasonable.  Offering it close to Bob's perceived value increases the chances of him engaging seriously in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By stating it's a ""starting point,"" we signal our willingness to negotiate, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product and would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000) and leaves a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome. 

We'll counter in the next round, strategically moving closer to a price that is acceptable while still aiming for a higher profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the value in this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,050,000? This offer reflects the product's true worth and my desire to strike a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a significant concession by decreasing our price by $50,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:**  However, we are not conceding too much too quickly. The new price is still closer to our initial offer, anchoring the negotiation closer to the higher end.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** By emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the deal, we subtly appeal to Bob's sense of reciprocity, potentially encouraging him to meet us closer to our asking price.

We are aiming to strike a balance between securing a profitable deal and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. My counteroffer is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,000,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, and we've reciprocated. Accepting this offer indicates we're reaching a fair compromise.
* **Time Value:**  While we have more rounds, there's always a risk Bob could walk away or the negotiation could stall.  Securing a profitable deal now is preferable to potentially losing this offer."
