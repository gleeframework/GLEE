Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear we are unlikely to reach a price that satisfies both of our valuations. Accepting his current offer of $950,000 would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not meeting my minimum, and I'd rather secure the guaranteed sale with John at this point."
