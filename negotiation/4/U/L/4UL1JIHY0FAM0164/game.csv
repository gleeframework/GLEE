"Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  While the product's value is significantly higher to me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
