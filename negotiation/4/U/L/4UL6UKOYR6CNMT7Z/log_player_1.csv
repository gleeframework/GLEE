"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone in the message encourages Bob to engage and be open to the offer.
* **Asking for Feedback:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and potentially start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I can still negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $110 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125?  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate but still protecting my minimum profit. 
* **Positive language:** Using ""split the difference"" and ""find some common ground"" keeps the conversation friendly and encourages further discussion.
* **Focus on value:**  I subtly remind Bob of the product's value by mentioning the possibility of finding ""common ground."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Need to Risk Further Negotiation:**  I've reached my goal of earning at least $120. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price. 
* **Avoiding the Fallback:** Selling to John at this point would give me the same amount of money.  By accepting Bob's offer, I finalize the deal and avoid the potential hassle of selling to John."
