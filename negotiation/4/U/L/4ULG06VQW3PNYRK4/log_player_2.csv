"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something of value at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $16,000 is significantly higher than both your $8,000 limit and John's $8,000 offer. It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer in this scenario."
