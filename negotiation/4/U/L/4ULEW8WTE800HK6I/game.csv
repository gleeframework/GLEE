"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product to me.  While I agree it's a good product, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will bring you value that justifies this price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about $11,000?  I feel that's a fair offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's try $15,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at that price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
