Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $90. Would you be interested in buying it?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters. I'm also being friendly and casual in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Can you consider reducing the price to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, I can still try to get a slightly higher price. There's no harm in seeing if we can reach a compromise closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $80 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm confident you'll find this product is well worth it."", ""product_price"": 85}
