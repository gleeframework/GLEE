Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.**  I'm willing to sell to John for that amount if Bob rejects my offer.
* **Bob values the product at $800,000.**  This means he's likely to pay up to that amount.
* **Offering $950,000:** This price is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It gives Bob room to negotiate but still allows me to earn more than I would from John.

By offering a price that's closer to Bob's valuation but still advantageous to me, I maximize my chances of striking a deal with Bob and earning a higher price."
