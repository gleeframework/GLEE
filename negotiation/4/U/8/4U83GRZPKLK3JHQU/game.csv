"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for countering. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $9,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,500 might be a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
