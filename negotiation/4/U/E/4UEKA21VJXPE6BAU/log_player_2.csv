"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try and negotiate a better price.  While $900,000 is a good deal, there's a chance Alice is willing to go lower.  We have 10 rounds to work with, so let's see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and encourages her to negotiate further. I'm also leaving room for compromise in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000. This is a good price and we're already saving $150,000 compared to John's offer. While there's always the potential to negotiate further, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers as we're running out of rounds.  It's a good deal and a safe bet."
