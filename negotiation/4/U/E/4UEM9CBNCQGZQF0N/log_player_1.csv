Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is well above your minimum but still leaves room for potential counteroffers. It also includes a friendly message to encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it is still below your target.  There is room to negotiate further, so rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
