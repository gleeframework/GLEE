"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but your asking price is a bit too high for me. Could you do $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $900,000.  I believe this price reflects the value it would bring to your operations.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. To be candid, $750,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to accept $850,000, but that's my best offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
