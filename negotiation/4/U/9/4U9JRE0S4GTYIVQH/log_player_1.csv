Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate and can potentially get closer to your desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **It shows confidence:** By starting high, you demonstrate the value you place on the product, which could make Bob more serious about buying it.

This is just the beginning of the negotiation.  We'll need to adapt our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum target.  I'll counter with a lower price, aiming to get closer to $900,000.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  It's a fair price for a valuable product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** It demonstrates that I'm open to finding a middle ground.
* **Maintains a higher price:** It still keeps the price above my minimum, giving me room for future negotiation if needed.
* **Justifies the price:** It frames the offer as a fair deal for both parties, increasing the chances of Bob accepting.

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is still a bit too low for me. It's closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to see if I can get a little closer to my target. I'll make a counteroffer, but if Bob rejects it again, I'm likely to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** It meets Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Stay above the minimum:** It keeps the price above my minimum threshold, ensuring I don't lose too much money.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  The message frames the offer as a mutually beneficial deal, making it more appealing to Bob.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely move on and sell to John."
