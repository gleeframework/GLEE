"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $14,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on this product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to make some concessions, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a compromise that still brings a good profit for me. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a profit, but $11,500 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250, which is a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about buying. If this isn't acceptable, I may have to consider other options.",11250.0,Bob,6,
