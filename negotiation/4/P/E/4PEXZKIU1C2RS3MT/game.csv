"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $825,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $825,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would $762,500 work for you?",762500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
