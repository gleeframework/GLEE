Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in valuing the product for me. Considering my budget and the market value, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000.  I still have time and I'm not in a rush to settle for a lower price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000. This offer reflects the significant value the product holds, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest proposal, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must stick to my budget. I am now offering $1,100,000 as the maximum I can pay for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my target price, I still believe that I can negotiate a slightly higher price. I still have time and I am not in a rush to settle for $1,100,000.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  I understand your budgetary constraints.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,112,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1112500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your proposal carefully, and while I understand your position, I'm still unable to meet you at $1,112,500. I am prepared to offer $1,100,000 as the final price for the product. I hope this brings us closer to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. 

While I'd like to get a slightly higher price, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is too high. It's clear that he is not willing to go above $1,100,000, and I'm unlikely to get much more by continuing.  John has already shown a firm commitment to buying at my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity."
