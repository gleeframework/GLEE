Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible without risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to try to counter-offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is still a bit above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully we can reach a deal close to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too close to my minimum value. I'm not confident I can get a better price from him, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
