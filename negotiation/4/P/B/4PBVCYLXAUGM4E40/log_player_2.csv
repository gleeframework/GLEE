{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible while still ensuring a successful purchase.  A counteroffer of $850,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is still above Alice's minimum selling price of $800,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and is closer to Bob's desired price.  While there's always the potential for further negotiation, accepting this offer minimizes risk and secures a good price."
