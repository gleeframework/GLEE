"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?  This gives us both a good deal.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  While $14,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $14,000. Would you be willing to consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference -  $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
