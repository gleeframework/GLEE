"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to let it go for a price of $2000000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1750000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1750000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1650000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, so I'll counteroffer at $1680000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1680000.0,Bob,6,
