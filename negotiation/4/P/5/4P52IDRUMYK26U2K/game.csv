"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to drop the price to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this deal happen!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
