Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, knowing that my minimum is $150.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $150, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to $200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise,  splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It gives Bob a bit more of a discount, but it still allows me to get a higher price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $160. It's higher than what John is offering and is a good compromise.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it."
