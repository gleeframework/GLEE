"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, given the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fantastic deal"" and emphasizing the value Bob will gain, hoping to encourage a positive response. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $1,200,000 allows for several rounds of negotiation before needing to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject and Counter:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming higher.  Rejecting allows me to counter and potentially get a better price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Even if I have to settle for less than my ideal price, there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired $1,200,000. 
* **Not Selling to John Yet:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000 but I'm not desperate yet.  More rounds of negotiation could yield a better outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial $1,200,000 but still keeping a significant profit margin.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value Bob will receive, hoping to sway him towards accepting my counteroffer.
* **Room for Future Negotiation:**  $1,000,000 gives us both some room to move in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Not Yet Satisfied:** While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** We're only $50,000 apart, and there's still potential for a compromise. 
* **Not Selling to John:**  John's offer is tempting, but I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000?  That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's very close to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to close the deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using encouraging language to increase the chances of Bob accepting.
* **High Profit:** Even at $975,000, I'm still earning significantly more than my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $925,000. Can we get even closer to a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're now in round 6, and Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still significantly lower than what I'd like. 
* **Risk of Lower Offer:** There's a risk that if I continue negotiating, Bob might offer even lower prices in the next few rounds, potentially forcing me to accept a price closer to his original $800,000 valuation.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is more than my minimum.  The risk of further negotiation isn't worth the potential for a lower price.

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a good profit and avoid the risk of getting a worse deal with Bob."
