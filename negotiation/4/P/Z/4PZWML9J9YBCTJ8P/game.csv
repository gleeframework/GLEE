"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my research and the product's market value, I'd be happy to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a good deal on your end.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering my research and what I believe the product is worth. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
