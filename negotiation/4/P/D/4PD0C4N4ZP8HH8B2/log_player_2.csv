Round 2

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we settle around $8,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming closer to our ideal price, but we're still not there.  We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to $10,000."

Round 4

""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $9,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. How about we try $11,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice seems stuck around the $11,000 mark. While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee we'll get a price significantly better than John's $10,000 offer. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed good deal."
