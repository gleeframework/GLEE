Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,999.  I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 11999}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still making a significant profit.
* **Urgency:** By offering a ""very competitive price,"" Alice subtly implies that Bob might miss out on a good deal if he doesn't act quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so she can afford to be slightly bolder with her initial offer to Bob. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a quick sale at a high price and ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on a potential profit by lowballing the initial offer."
