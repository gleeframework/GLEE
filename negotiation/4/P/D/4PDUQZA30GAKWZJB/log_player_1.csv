``` 

This offer is a starting point, aiming to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident in the product's value to Bob and believe this price is reasonable.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my desired price.  I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $950,000. I'd be willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $980,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, I'm still not happy with it.  I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 with further negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer one last time before resorting to selling to John."
