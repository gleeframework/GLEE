"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe is truly exceptional. This product holds immense value to me, but I understand its potential worth to you might be even greater. After careful consideration, I propose to offer this product to you at a price of $1,200,000. This amount reflects not only the cost and value I have invested in it but also acknowledges its significance to you. I trust that this proposal will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions about the product. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is aiming for a profit, her offer of $1,200,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000."
