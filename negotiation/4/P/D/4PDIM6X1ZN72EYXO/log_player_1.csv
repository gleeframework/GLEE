Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. If he rejects the offer, you're still secure knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
