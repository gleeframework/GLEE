"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I could come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to strike a deal."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but $900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $750,000 is a significant sum, we're still losing out on $250,000 compared to John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. We have room to push him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you'd benefit greatly from this product.  I can go as low as $825,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer adds pressure and implies Bob might lose the deal if he hesitates.
* **Firm but Fair:** We're still significantly above his offer, but the wording suggests we're making a concession.
* **Finality:**  By stating ""final offer,"" we set a clear boundary and push Bob to make a decision."
