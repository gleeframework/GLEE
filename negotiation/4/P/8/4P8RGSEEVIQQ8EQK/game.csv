"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I could come down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to strike a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but $900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you'd benefit greatly from this product.  I can go as low as $825,000. This is my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
