{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but also leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and what his reaction is to this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to make a deal,  I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $7,500 is below what I'm able to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to see if we can make this work. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm still hoping to get a better price, Bob's last offer is below my minimum.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially get an even lower price.  John is offering my minimum, so it's a safer bet to sell to him."
