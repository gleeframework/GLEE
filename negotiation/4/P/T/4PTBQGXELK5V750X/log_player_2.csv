Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I can do, I'm still a bit over budget. How about $1,100,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still above my preferred price point. I want to keep negotiating and see if I can get it down even further before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a little over my budget at $1,125,000.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,115,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,115,000 is very close to my ideal price point and within my budget of $1,500,000.  While I could try to push for a lower price, it's likely that Alice won't budge further.  It's a good deal for me and I'd rather avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
