{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a middle ground.
* **Attractive Offer:** $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob compared to his valuation of $8,000, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John is guaranteed $15,000, but I want to try and maximize my profits if possible. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and try to close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a little lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I highlight the value of the product to emphasize the fairness of my price. 
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language to maintain a friendly tone and encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer maintains a good negotiating position while still offering a potentially attractive deal to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag out the process and potentially lead to a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John at $15,000 guarantees me my minimum profit and eliminates the risk of getting a lower price from Bob.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial desired price, the certainty of selling to John outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal with Bob."
