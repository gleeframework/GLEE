"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than the $120 John is asking, you can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price to make a deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, but you can try to negotiate further.  By rejecting her offer, you can counteroffer again and potentially get the price closer to your target. You are also willing to pay $120 to John, so there is no immediate need to accept an offer above your preferred price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $117.5 is getting closer to your upper limit, but it's still not within your preferred range. Since you're willing to pay $120 to John, it makes more sense to go with the guaranteed price from John rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's no guarantee Alice will accept your next counteroffer, and you risk wasting time."
