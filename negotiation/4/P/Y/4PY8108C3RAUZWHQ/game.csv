"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I know it holds significant value for you as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,1,
