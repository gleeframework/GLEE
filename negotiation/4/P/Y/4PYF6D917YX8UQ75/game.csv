"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm interested in the product but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not ready to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about we settle on $9500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I can offer you the product for $11000. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",11000.0,Alice,5,
