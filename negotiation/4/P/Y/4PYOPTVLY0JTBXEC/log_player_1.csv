Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum price of $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks leaving money on the table. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical decision at this point."
