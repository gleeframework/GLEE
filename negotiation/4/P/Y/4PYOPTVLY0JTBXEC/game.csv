"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true value and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is the right price for the product. I'm willing to pay $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from there.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This offer takes into account the value it brings and represents my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not comfortable with the price at $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $950,000, which is $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
