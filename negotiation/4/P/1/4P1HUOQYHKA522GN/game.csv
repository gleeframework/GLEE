"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't afford $1,200,000 at this time. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I acknowledge the value you've placed on the product, I'm not able to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's still fair considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position and appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still unable to meet the $1,050,000 price point. I would like to propose $1,025,000 as a potential meeting ground. I hope this proposal allows us to move closer towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
