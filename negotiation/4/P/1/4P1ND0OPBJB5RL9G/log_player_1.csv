"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. This takes into account its long-term worth, which I'm confident you'll recognize."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum allows room for negotiation and signals that I value the product highly.
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number; I'm framing it in terms of ""unique value"" and ""long-term worth"" to plant those seeds in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm aiming for a high sale, I know I have John as a reliable backup. This knowledge gives me confidence to start strong with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 as a starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own valuation of the product. While he acknowledges the value, his opening offer suggests he's aiming for a bargain. Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive while signaling that I'm serious about the product's worth. I'm still comfortable walking away and selling to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table.  Let's meet closer to the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and sets us up for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Higher Counter:** I'm countering with a price much closer to my minimum but still above Bob's valuation. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's worth and emphasizing the goal of a ""mutually beneficial deal."" This subtly reminds Bob that I have other options. 
* **Strategic Concession:** While a significant drop, the $250,000 concession shows I'm willing to move for the right deal.  It also puts the ball back in Bob's court to make a meaningful counter-proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the movement on price.  While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,100,000. This offer considers the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum. His message suggests he's anchoring his price around his perceived ""budget,"" which may or may not be a genuine constraint. 

While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. Rejecting gives me another opportunity to gauge his seriousness and potentially move him closer to a more acceptable range. I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I appreciate your latest offer, we're still quite a ways apart.  To be transparent, I have another interested buyer at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but this is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Urgency:** I'm subtly letting Bob know about John (""another interested buyer"") to create a sense of urgency and competition. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm drawing a line in the sand. This can push Bob to be more realistic if he's truly interested.
* **Significant but Acceptable Concession:** I'm dropping the price by another $150,000, a substantial move demonstrating my willingness to close the deal. However, it keeps me comfortably above my absolute minimum.

This approach aims to make Bob understand the potential of losing the deal while still offering him a reasonable, though firm, final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,600,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  If you're truly interested in reaching a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. However, this is my final offer. I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer is Unacceptable:** Bob's final offer of $1,200,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Stalemate Likely:**  We've both presented final offers with a significant gap. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.
* **John Guarantees My Minimum:**  John's standing offer of $1,500,000 ensures I won't lose money and allows me to move on without further risk or time investment.

While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's risky. He's unlikely to move much higher, and I risk losing both deals. Accepting John's offer is the safest and most profitable decision at this point."
