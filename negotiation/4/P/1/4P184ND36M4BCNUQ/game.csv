"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
