Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
