"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that's in both of our best interests. If you're not comfortable with that, I may have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise at $11,500. This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
