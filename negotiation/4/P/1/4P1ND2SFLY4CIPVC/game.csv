"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.  The value this product offers is substantial. Would you consider $1,350,000? This allows us both to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we settle this right now? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
