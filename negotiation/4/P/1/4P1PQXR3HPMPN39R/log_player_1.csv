Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's an opportunity to make even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer price of $1,150,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you room for negotiation.
    * Attractive enough that Bob might consider it a bargain compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The message subtly implies you have other interested buyers (which you do with John), creating a sense of urgency and competition. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
