"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
