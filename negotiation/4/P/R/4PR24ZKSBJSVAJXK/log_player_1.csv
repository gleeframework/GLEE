Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Value:** You value the product at $12,000.
* **John's Value:** John is a backup buyer willing to pay $12,000. 

By offering $14,000, you aim to capture most of the potential surplus from the transaction while still being attractive to Bob. This leaves a $1,000 profit margin for you, which is better than selling to John for $12,000.  It's likely that Bob will accept, as he can still get a good deal and a value of $1,000 for the product."
