"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Description] for a price that I believe is very attractive.  While I can't disclose the exact value of the product to you, I can assure you that it's worth significantly more than $800000 to me.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, which is a significant discount from its true value.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.  If you're interested, please let me know, and we can discuss the details further.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
