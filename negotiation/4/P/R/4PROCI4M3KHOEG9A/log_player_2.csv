"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiating further, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What do you think?
