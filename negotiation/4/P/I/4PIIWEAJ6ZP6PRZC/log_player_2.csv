"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, and you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer.  There's a possibility you can get the product for less from Alice through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer at $800,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to come down a bit to avoid going to John and paying the full $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, I'm still trying to save as much money as possible. I'm going to reject Alice's offer and continue to negotiate.  There's still a possibility I can get the product for less than $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $850,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and a significant discount from Alice's current offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is getting close to my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I'd still like to save more, the risk of further negotiation failing and being forced to buy from John for a higher price is too high. Accepting this offer will guarantee I get the product at a lower price than John's offer."
