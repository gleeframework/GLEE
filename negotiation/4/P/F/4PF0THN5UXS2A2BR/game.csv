"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum acceptable price.  The value of this product is significant, and I'm confident it will be very beneficial for your business. To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's value while allowing for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product brings, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's worth.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident the product's potential benefit to your business justifies a higher investment. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a final price of $1,550,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's make this deal happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
