"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $18000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",18000.0,Alice,1,
