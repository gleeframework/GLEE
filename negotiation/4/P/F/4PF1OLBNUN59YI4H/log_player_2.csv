"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating further or going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, he can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate. He knows he can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he has leverage to push Alice lower."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While $10,500 is a better deal than Alice's previous offers, he can get it for $8,000 from John.  The negotiation with Alice is becoming drawn out, and Bob doesn't want to risk her counteroffering again and potentially driving the price higher. He's confident he can get the product from John at a price he's comfortable with."
