"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to discuss the price of this product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $135. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is a good compromise.  It's lower than her initial offer and within Bob's budget. Accepting the offer secures the product at a fair price without risking further negotiation."
