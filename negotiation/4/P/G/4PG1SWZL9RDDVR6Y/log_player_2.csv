"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you can get the product for $12,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a potential counter-offer at a lower price, closer to Alice's perceived value of $8,000."
