"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $800,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, my budget is firm.  Would you consider $900,000? That's a significant offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
