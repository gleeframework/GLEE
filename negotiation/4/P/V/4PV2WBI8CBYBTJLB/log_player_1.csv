Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $1,200,000, so Bob has room to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It shows you're serious:** You're not starting lowball, showing Bob that you're ready to negotiate but also value the product. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still lower than the price I want to achieve. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit off on that price.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
``` 

This counteroffer is strategically chosen:

* **Compromise:** It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and meet him halfway.
* **Attractive price:** $975,000 is still a great price for Bob considering the value of the product to him.
* **Room for final negotiation:** There's still some room for Bob to potentially counteroffer, but it's getting close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not willing to go above $950,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $962,500? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, Bob's offer is very close to my desired price. It's a good deal for both of us.  While I'd like to get a little more, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for less."
