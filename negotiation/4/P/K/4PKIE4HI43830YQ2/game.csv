"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $9,000. This is a fair price considering we're both willing to compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $9,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Alice,5,
