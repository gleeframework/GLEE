Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate, and also gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer if he's really interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous offer, but I'm still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility while also showing that I'm not willing to sell for too much less than what I value the product at."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $130 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's also higher than what I know he values the product at.  Accepting his offer will guarantee a sale and I can move on to other opportunities."
