Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with the highest possible price I'm comfortable with.  Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'm not willing to go any lower than that right away. It's possible Bob might be willing to pay that much since it's still less than what it's worth to him.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $115. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise from my initial offer.  Let's see if this is acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much from his original offer. While $108 is a decent profit, I'm confident that I can sell it to John for $120. This is a better deal for me, and I'd rather not risk going through more rounds of negotiation with Bob, potentially lowering the final price. I'm going to sell the product to John."
