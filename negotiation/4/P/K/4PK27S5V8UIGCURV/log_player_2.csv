"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still possible to save more money. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay a little less. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's still significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and saves Bob $350,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will result in a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it for a potential $50,000 savings."
