"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond this price point, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a much lower offer gives you room for negotiation. While $6,000 is a significant difference from Alice's initial price, it leaves space for a potential compromise that remains within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $12,000 is closer to my bottom line. Could you meet me halfway at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still above both your budget and what you could get it for from John. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair offer, considering I can get it elsewhere for $8,000."", ""product_price"": 7000}

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer. By mentioning John's offer, you're signaling that you have other options without completely revealing your walk-away point. This keeps the pressure on Alice while demonstrating your seriousness about the purchase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one final concession at $8,500. This is my best and final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and her final offer of $8,500 is still above John's price of $8,000. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and save the extra $500."
