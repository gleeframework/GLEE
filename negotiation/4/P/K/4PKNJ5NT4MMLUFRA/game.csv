"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $12,000 is closer to my bottom line. Could you meet me halfway at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair offer, considering I can get it elsewhere for $8,000.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one final concession at $8,500. This is my best and final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
