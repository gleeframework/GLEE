Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise at $115, which is still a good deal for you. It's my minimum price, though.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $115. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $115 for the product. My final offer is $112.50. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While ideally, getting the product for $105 would be great, Alice seems firm on her minimum price. Accepting $112.50 secures a significant saving compared to John's $150 offer.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice walking away."
