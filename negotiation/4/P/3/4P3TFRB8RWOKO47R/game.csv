"I understand you think the price is a bit high, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Would you be willing to go up to $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise at $115, which is still a good deal for you. It's my minimum price, though.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand it's your minimum price, but I can't go higher than $105. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",105.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $115. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $115 for the product. My final offer is $112.50. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",112.5,Alice,7,
