"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm offering it to you first for $20000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10000 right now.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15000?  That's still a great deal for a product of this quality.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let me know if you're open to that.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this.  $12000 is closer, but I still need to make a little more on this. How about $13500?  I'm not sure I can go any lower.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm really hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $12500?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
