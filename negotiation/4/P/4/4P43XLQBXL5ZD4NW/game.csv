"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,500?  It's a good price and I'm ready to buy right now.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could we do $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $7,500 is simply not feasible for me. How about we split the difference at $8,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a great deal and me to cover my costs. Let's find a way to make this work!",8250.0,Alice,5,
