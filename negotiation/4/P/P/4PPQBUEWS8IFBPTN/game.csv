"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I appreciate the value of this product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000. I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was expecting a bit more enthusiasm for this product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. How about we try $700,000?  I'm serious about getting this deal done.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",800000.0,Alice,5,
