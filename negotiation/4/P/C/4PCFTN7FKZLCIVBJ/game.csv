"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $15000?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $15000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $13000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price for the product, but $13000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $11500.  Let's try to close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is closer to what I need, but I'm still a bit short.  How about $12500?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
