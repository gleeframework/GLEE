"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $200, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 right now.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is far too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price given the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can finalize a deal here.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $115, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",115.0,Bob,6,
