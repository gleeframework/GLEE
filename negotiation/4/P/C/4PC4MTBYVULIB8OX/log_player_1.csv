Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer of $10,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to get more. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to get a price closer to my target. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer secures a sale and minimizes potential losses."
