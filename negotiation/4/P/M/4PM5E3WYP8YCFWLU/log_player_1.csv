Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Safety Net:** We know John will buy the product for $800,000, so we need to offer Bob a price that's significantly better than that to incentivize him.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.  

This strategy aims to find the sweet spot between maximizing profit from Bob while ensuring the product is sold."
