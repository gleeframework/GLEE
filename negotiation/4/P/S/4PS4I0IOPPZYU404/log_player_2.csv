{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $120, which is closer to your target, it's still above your $100 limit. At this point, with only three rounds left, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $100.  You've successfully negotiated a lower price, and  you're not likely to get much lower with Alice, given her previous offers.  It's time to secure the deal and avoid further haggling."
