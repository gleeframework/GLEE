"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my target price of $1,200,000. This is the maximum value I'm willing to accept, as I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll use this round to send a counter-offer that bridges the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial price, but it's still a considerable profit for me and it's also closer to Bob's desired price, which might make him more likely to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, I'm starting to run out of time. Accepting this offer secures a sale that's closer to my minimum threshold, and it's unlikely Bob will budge further.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing both Bob and John."
