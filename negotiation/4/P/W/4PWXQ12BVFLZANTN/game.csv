"I really like the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000, so I'm offering $12,250. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",12250.0,Bob,4,
