"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $2,250,000 is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $1,250,000? That's a fair offer, considering the market value.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle at $1,700,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
