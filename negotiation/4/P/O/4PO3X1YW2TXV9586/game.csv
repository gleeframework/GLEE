"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its high value and the benefits it provides, I would like to extend an exclusive offer of $1,250,000 for this opportunity.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and would allow us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a solution that benefits both parties. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to adjust the price slightly to $1,100,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the original price, while also aligning more closely with your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm confident we can find a sweet spot.  I'd like to offer $1,050,000. This price is a fair reflection of the value I see in the product, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am willing to move forward with a price of $1,075,000. This represents a substantial discount from the original price and I believe it will be agreeable to both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting very close!  I'm still aiming for that $1,050,000 price point.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,062,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen!",1062500.0,Bob,6,
