Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. It's a bit more within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $7,500 is too low, and I'm confident I can do better."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle at $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I've already rejected a lower offer and don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer is the best option to ensure a quick sale and meet my minimum price."
