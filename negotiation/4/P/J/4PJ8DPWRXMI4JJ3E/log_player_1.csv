Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is higher for Bob than John, it hints at exclusivity and potential (""before I list it publicly,"" ""value and potential""). This can make Bob feel like he's getting a special opportunity.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offer:** The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer outright.  However, since we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, it's worth attempting a higher price point first."
