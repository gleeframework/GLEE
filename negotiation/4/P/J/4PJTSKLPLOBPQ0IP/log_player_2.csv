"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, you can potentially do better. You're aiming to save as much as possible, and there's room for negotiation with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still within your budget and a good deal compared to John's offer of $10,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again, and you might end up with a higher price or having to buy from John. Accepting this offer is the safest option to get the product at a reasonable price."
