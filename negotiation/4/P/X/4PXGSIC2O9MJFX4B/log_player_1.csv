{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you, and it allows me to make a good profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $11,000 is the best I can do. It's still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
