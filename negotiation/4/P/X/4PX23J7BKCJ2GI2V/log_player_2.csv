{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between my maximum and Alice's minimum. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price, but also that I'm not going to blindly accept her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a better deal than $1,200,000, I'm still aiming to get the price down as low as possible. Alice has already moved from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, indicating she's open to negotiation. I'll continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is still well below her current offer, but closer to the middle ground, encouraging her to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  We're getting closer, but I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me another chance to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $1,000,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to go much higher.  It's a compromise, and I believe it's a price that's fair for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her original offer of $1,100,000. While I was hoping for a lower price, we've reached a stalemate. It's better to accept this offer and save $100,000 compared to buying from John. Continuing the negotiation risks running out of rounds and forcing me to buy from John at a higher price."
