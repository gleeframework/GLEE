You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within his budget, it's still a significant amount.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. He's starting with a bold counteroffer of $950,000, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that he's serious about negotiating and hopes to get a deal closer to his ideal price. While it's a big jump, it's within his budget, and he's leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer.  He should continue to negotiate.  He has room to move without reaching his maximum budget, and he's still better off than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's last offer, but still significantly lower than her initial price.  It's a compromise, but it still allows him to save money compared to buying from John. He is trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, he still has room to negotiate. He has shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice has also shown flexibility.  He should continue to see if he can get a better price by making another counteroffer.  He still has five rounds left, so he's not running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a counteroffer that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's offer.  He is trying to show that he is willing to compromise but also that he is not willing to pay too much. He is trying to find a price that is acceptable to both parties.  He has shown that he is willing to negotiate and that he is not afraid to walk away if he doesn't get a good deal. This will put pressure on Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is close to his budget limit, but he has shown a willingness to negotiate and Alice has shown flexibility.  He has four rounds left and is still in a better position than buying from John.  He should make another counteroffer to try to close the deal at a price closer to his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget limit, but he believes that Alice is also getting closer to her bottom line.  This is his final counteroffer before he might have to consider buying from John.  He is trying to find a compromise that is acceptable to both parties.  He has shown a willingness to negotiate and is not afraid to walk away if he doesn't get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is beyond Bob's budget.  He has shown a willingness to negotiate and has made several counteroffers, but Alice has not been willing to meet him halfway.  He only has one round left, and it's not likely that Alice will drop her price significantly in the next round.  Buying from John, at $1,500,000, is the best option for Bob, even though it's not ideal.  He's at least securing the product within his budget."
