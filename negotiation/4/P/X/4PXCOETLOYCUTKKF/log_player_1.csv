Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $10,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000), so he has an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still go up in price if Bob makes a counteroffer, but you're not starting off too high and risking him rejecting it immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. It's worth trying to get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is your minimum, and while you'd prefer more, you're at a point where further negotiation isn't likely to yield much gain. John is offering the same amount, and since he's a guaranteed sale, it's the most efficient choice."
