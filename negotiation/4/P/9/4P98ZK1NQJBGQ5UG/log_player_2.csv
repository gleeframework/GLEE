"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll choose option 2: RejectOffer. I think $200 is too high, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is quite low for the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my next counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $170 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $155, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?"", ""product_price"": 155}"
