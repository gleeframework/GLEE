"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1800000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000. Can you meet me halfway?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a price of $1600000. This is my best compromise at the moment. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
