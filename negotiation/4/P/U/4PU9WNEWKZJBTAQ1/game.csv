"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its actual market value. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000.  This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Your final offer is tempting.  However, I'm on a tight budget, and $1,225,000 is the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're unable to accept this, I understand, but I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
