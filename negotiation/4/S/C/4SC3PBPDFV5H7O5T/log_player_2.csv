"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's not worth accepting this offer. You should reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $16,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  John is offering the product at my desired price, so it's the most logical choice to buy from him and avoid the potential of further counteroffers from Alice."
