,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for such a great product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $95?  This would be a good price for both of us, and we could close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
