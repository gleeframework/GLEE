"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $15,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I respect that.  Let's make this work - $12,500, and we have a deal.  This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
