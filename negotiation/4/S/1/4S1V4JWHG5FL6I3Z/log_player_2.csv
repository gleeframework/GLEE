"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for less by negotiating with Alice.  He should reject the initial offer and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within his budget. This gives him room to negotiate and hopefully reach a compromise that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is closer to his target, he still has some room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to counter-offer allows him to potentially reach an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's willing to increase his offer slightly, but he's still pushing for a lower price. This strategy aims to show Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's not willing to overpay."
