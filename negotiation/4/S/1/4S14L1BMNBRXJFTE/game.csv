"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it at this time. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to my budget, around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to justify spending $17,000 on it. I would like to propose a price closer to my budget, around $13,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price that works.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $13,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $15,500? I'm taking a loss at that price, but I value building a positive business relationship. ",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. However, I'm still not able to justify spending $15,500 on the product. I would like to propose a price closer to my budget, around $14,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",14000.0,Bob,6,
