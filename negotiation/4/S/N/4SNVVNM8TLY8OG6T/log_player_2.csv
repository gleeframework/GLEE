Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

While Alice is coming down, we're still not at a price I'm fully comfortable with. There's a chance to negotiate a little further down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way to $95, Bob. But I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $97.50? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to find a mutually beneficial deal.

You have three options:

Alice is clearly committed to negotiating in smaller increments now.  While I could try to push for $95, it's getting very close. Accepting at $97.50 guarantees I get a good deal without risking the negotiation falling apart."
