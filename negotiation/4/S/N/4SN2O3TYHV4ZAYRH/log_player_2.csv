"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. 

It makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
