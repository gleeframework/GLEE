"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This price still reflects the product's substantial value while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
