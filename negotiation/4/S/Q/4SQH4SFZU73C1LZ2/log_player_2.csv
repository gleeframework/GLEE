{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range considering my maximum budget.  Starting at a lower price gives me more room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price.  There are still a few rounds left, so I have time to make a few more counteroffers before I need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'm increasing my offer slightly.  This counteroffer is still below my maximum budget and gives us more room to find a price we both agree on.  I'm hoping to get a deal in the next few rounds before I have to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my budget, but her price is getting closer. I'll reject the offer again and see if I can negotiate further. There are still a few rounds left, so I have time to make a few more counteroffers.  I'm hoping to get a deal before I have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so I'm raising my offer slightly again. This counteroffer is still below my maximum budget, but closer to Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal in the next few rounds.  I'm also considering that I have fewer rounds left and need to be careful not to get stuck with John's higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm hoping to get a better price with another counteroffer.  However, I'm starting to run out of rounds, and I'm getting closer to John's price.  I need to be strategic with my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer, and it's my maximum budget. I'm hoping Alice will accept, as we are very close to a deal.  If she rejects, I'll have to buy from John, which I'm not thrilled about, but it's the only way to get the product. With only two rounds remaining, I'm taking a calculated risk by offering my maximum."
