"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me, and hopefully, it's a starting point for our negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I'm looking for. Considering the unique value this product brings, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a good middle ground between our numbers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
