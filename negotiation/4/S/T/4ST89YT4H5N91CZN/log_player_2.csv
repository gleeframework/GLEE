"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise and bring my price down to $1,100,000. This price still leaves a profit margin for me while being significantly more reasonable than my initial offer.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

Alice's offer:

This offer is a fair compromise, giving you a good deal while allowing me to meet my financial needs. Let's finalize this transaction and make it happen.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  It makes more sense to buy from John for $1,000,000 and save the potential $50,000+ in further negotiation."
