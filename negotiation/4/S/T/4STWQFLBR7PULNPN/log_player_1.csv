I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value, but leaving room for negotiation. I believe $140 is a fair price, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $130. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to sell it for less than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to pay $132 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $132 is above my minimum value of $120.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
