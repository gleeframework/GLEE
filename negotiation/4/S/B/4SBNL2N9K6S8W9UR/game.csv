"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my best offer, as it's my maximum budget. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1250000?  This gives you a fair price and ensures I can make a profit.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 still isn't quite enough for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $1175000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1175000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1100000. This is the absolute most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm running out of time, so please let me know your final decision.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the back-and-forth. However, $1100000 is still too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $1150000 as a final offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and allows me to secure a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
