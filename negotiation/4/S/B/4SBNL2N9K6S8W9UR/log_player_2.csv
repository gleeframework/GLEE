"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my best offer, as it's my maximum budget. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your maximum budget, but also a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. This will force Alice to decide if she's willing to negotiate further or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1250000?  This gives you a fair price and ensures I can make a profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also keeping in mind the option of buying from John if negotiations don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $100,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum budget. This counteroffer demonstrates my seriousness while still leaving room for further negotiation.  It's a strategy to hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 still isn't quite enough for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $1175000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's getting closer, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I'm also becoming increasingly aware of the time constraint. I have only 5 rounds left before I have to decide whether to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,100,000. This is the absolute most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm running out of time, so please let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reiterating my previous counteroffer of $1,100,000. This shows I'm firm in my position but also acknowledges the time pressure. By highlighting that this is the ""absolute most I can afford,"" I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency and push Alice towards a final decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the back-and-forth. However, $1100000 is still too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $1150000 as a final offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and allows me to secure a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $1,150,000, which is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  With only 3 rounds left, I'm running out of time and it's highly unlikely that Alice will come down further.  To avoid risking a loss in the negotiation, I'm going to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This ensures that I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
