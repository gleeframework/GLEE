"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged. 
* I'll closely analyze Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my best offer, as it's my maximum budget. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a major loss. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is a far cry from my ideal price, it indicates he's still interested. I can use this to try and negotiate a better deal. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John as a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum, but still acknowledging Bob's budget limitations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,250,000?  This gives you a fair price and ensures I can make a profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us.  
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.  

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both parties.
* I'll continue to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate and adjust my offers accordingly.
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation continues:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, which suggests there's still potential for negotiation.  
* **Selling to John is an option:**  However, I'm wary of continuing to negotiate too long. I'll be prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't get closer to my target price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round.  I'll try to push Bob a little higher, but I'll also be mindful of the limited rounds remaining and the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 still isn't quite enough for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a compromise that splits the difference between my previous counteroffer and Bob's latest offer.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm reiterating that this price is fair and beneficial for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone can help keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a price point that's close to my minimum while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* I'm monitoring the remaining rounds and the guaranteed offer from John to determine my next move.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider selling to John in the next round, as we are approaching the halfway point of our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1175000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1100000. This is the absolute most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm running out of time, so please let me know your final decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial financial loss.
* **Limited Time:**  While Bob is emphasizing the limited time, I have to prioritize maximizing my profit. 
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I have the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John as a backup, so I can afford to be firm with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to push Bob a little higher, but I'll also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the back-and-forth. However, $1,100,000 is still too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000 as a final offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and allows me to secure a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.

* **Value and Profit:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value to him and highlighting my need for a reasonable profit.
* **Closing Tone:** I'm using a closing tone to encourage Bob to agree and finalize the deal.

**Strategy:**

* I'm balancing the need to get a decent price with the urgency of closing the deal.
* I'll closely observe Bob's reaction and be prepared to accept his offer if it's my best available option."
