"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference and agree on $110. I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about $112? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",112.0,Alice,5,
