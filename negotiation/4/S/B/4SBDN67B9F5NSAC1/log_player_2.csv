Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price you're comfortable with, but leaves room for some potential compromise.  It's aggressive but reasonable given your goal of saving as much money as possible."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is closer to your budget, and you've already rejected one counteroffer.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product, especially since it's only $1,000 more than your backup option with John."
