"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I'm not giving away too much at the beginning, but also showing that I'm open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and would like to propose $10,500 as a fair price for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I'd like to propose $11,000 as a fair price for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I've been pushing for a higher price, but at this point, Bob is offering $11,000, which is just above my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $15,000, so I'll accept this offer."
