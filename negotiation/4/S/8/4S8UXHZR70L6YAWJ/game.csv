"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9500.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. ",9500.0,Bob,4,
