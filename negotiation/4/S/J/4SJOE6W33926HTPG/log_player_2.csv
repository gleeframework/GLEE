The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice's offer is $150.  This is far too high.  I will reject her offer and counter-offer a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm offering Alice $80 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and her potential profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $110 is still too high for me. I'm not willing to pay more than $80, and I know I can get the product from John at that price. I'll buy from John."
