"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort you've put into this negotiation. However, I am unable to agree to the price of $900000. Given the product's value to me is $1200000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering our respective positions. I look forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
