Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $20,000. I believe it presents a unique value proposition at this price point, even if it's a little above your stated budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand Bob's true interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John is a guaranteed sale at $15,000 gives you leverage. You can afford to be firm in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is still significantly above his perceived value of $8,000, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** Accepting $12,000 would mean losing out on a guaranteed $15,000 from John. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** By rejecting this offer, we can gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially negotiate a better deal closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Apparent):**  By suggesting we ""meet halfway,""  it creates a sense of compromise even though we're negotiating towards a more favorable outcome.
* **Above Guaranteed Sale:** The $16,000 offer is still comfortably above John's offer, ensuring we don't leave money on the table if Bob accepts.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Bob is willing to be and whether a deal closer to our desired price is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I think that's the most I can stretch to. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** While not ideal, $14,000 is a significant profit over Bob's perceived value and a decent return overall.
* **Risk Minimization:**  Continuing negotiations risks Bob walking away or lowering his offer further. Accepting now guarantees the sale.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The potential to squeeze an extra $1,000 by going back to John isn't worth the risk of losing Bob altogether and having to restart negotiations."
