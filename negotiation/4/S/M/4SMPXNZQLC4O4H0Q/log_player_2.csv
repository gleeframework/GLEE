Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for your specific use case. To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair offer.
