"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $11,500. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on this incredible item, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Bob is better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John, as this is the closest he can get to his budget."
