Alice's offer is way too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation."

While Alice's price is lower, it's still too high.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a fair price."

Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to my maximum.  At this point, it's worth accepting to avoid potentially going back and forth with Alice for longer and risking her walking away."
