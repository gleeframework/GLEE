This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's latest offer is too low.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for a fair price, and it's important to me to get a deal done."
