Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $100. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $100? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.
