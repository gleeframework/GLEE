"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's make this deal happen!",1012500.0,Alice,5,
