``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a price close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

$900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
