"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my last offer. How about $9,125?  That's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we settle at $8,900? That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $8,900 is a good compromise. It's much closer to what I want than John's offer of $8,000, and I believe it's worth the risk of losing a few hundred dollars rather than waiting for a potential counteroffer that may not be as favorable."
