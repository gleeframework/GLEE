"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's only fair to present this opportunity at a price that reflects its true value. We kindly propose a purchase price of $750,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  $750,000 is a decent starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider that amount?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. While we understand your budget constraints, we would like to respectfully suggest a compromise. We propose a purchase price of $725,000 for the product. This offers a middle ground between our initial proposal and your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is willing to negotiate. It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  Let's meet in the middle at $710,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 710000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. We've considered your latest offer carefully, and we're proposing a purchase price of $715,000. We believe this strikes a balance between our previous offers and provides a fair value for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now only $5,000 above your target price. It's likely she won't go any lower, and it's better to accept the offer and secure the product than risk her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially driving the price up."
