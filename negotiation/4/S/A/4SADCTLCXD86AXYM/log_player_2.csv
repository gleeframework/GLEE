"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $12,000. There are 9 rounds remaining, so Bob has time to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to negotiate a price closer to his ideal value of $10,000. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  The message is friendly and emphasizes Bob's interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to both of us is undeniable. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price, but it's still above his desired $12,000 value. There are 7 rounds remaining, and Bob can continue to try to negotiate a lower price. He's likely to get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and continuing the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate a price closer to his ideal value of $10,000.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,900. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is now below Bob's maximum value of $12,000. While it's not the ideal price, accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable cost and avoid the risk of further negotiation. There are still 5 rounds remaining, but the potential for further savings might not outweigh the certainty of getting a good deal now."
