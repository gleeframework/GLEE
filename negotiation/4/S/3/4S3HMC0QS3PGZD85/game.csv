"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the potential sale with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which still represents a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $860,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. While $870,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm prepared to offer $855,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",855000.0,Bob,6,
