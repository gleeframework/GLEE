Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me, hoping to pique Bob's interest.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll need to see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed option, I'm willing to take a calculated risk by continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's a chance I could secure a higher price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too far from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm focusing on finding a ""fair"" price that benefits both of us.
* **Staying firm:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $125 is a more reasonable price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While he's moved closer to my minimum, $125 is still below my acceptable threshold of $150.
* **Time is money:**  We've been negotiating for a while, and I'm not sure how much further Bob is willing to budge. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's less risky and more time-efficient than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a guaranteed profit and avoid further negotiation. While I might be able to get a bit more from Bob, the risk of a stalemate or a lengthy negotiation isn't worth it.**"
