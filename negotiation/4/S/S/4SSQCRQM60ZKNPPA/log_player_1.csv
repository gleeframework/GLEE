Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it.  This price reflects its high quality and the potential it holds for your company's growth. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, considering its value to me and the potential for future collaboration. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to him. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, potentially getting closer to my desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, but I believe it remains fair given the product's value to your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is closer to my desired range, I'm still aiming for a more mutually beneficial price.  I'd like to offer $900000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to achieve a successful outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price. It's still significantly higher than what I would get from John and represents a good deal for me considering the remaining rounds.  It's time to take the deal and secure a profitable outcome."
