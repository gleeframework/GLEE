"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However,  $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? I think that's a fair price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you lowering the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $9,500. I can offer it to you for $11,500. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
