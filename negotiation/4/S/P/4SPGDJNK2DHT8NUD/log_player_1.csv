"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $1,100,000 to start negotiations. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and creates the perception of value. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,100,000, I'm setting a high anchor, influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room:** This initial offer acknowledges Bob's valuation to some extent while still providing a significant margin for me to negotiate.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The fact that I have another buyer (John) willing to pay my desired price gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below the market value of what this product can offer. To be fair to both of us, I can go down to $950,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Firmness:** By stating ""this is my final offer,"" I'm conveying a sense of urgency and firmness in my position. This could encourage Bob to be more serious in his counteroffers.
* **Strategic Concession:** While I lowered my price, the decrease is substantial enough to demonstrate movement but not so drastic that it undermines the product's value. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, which adds pressure. This firm stance could potentially push Bob closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for him to go higher, especially considering he stated the product's worth to him is $800,000. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $900,000 if you can agree to that price. This offer represents a significant saving for you compared to the value you'll get from the product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This offer positions the compromise as fair and mutually beneficial. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly encouraging him to stretch his budget. 
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** While I'm compromising, I'm still holding firm above my absolute minimum price.
* **Time Awareness:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, so I'm applying some pressure to reach a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can stretch my budget to $750,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting into the later rounds, and Bob is still significantly under his own valuation of the product. While his offers are increasing, the pace is slow. I need to signal that my price is firming up:

* **Maintain Leverage:** I have a strong alternative with John, and I don't want to give that up easily, especially when Bob has room to move.
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob might walk away, but there's also a risk of leaving money on the table by accepting too low a price.
* **Limited Time:**  With only four rounds remaining, I need to apply more pressure to get Bob to move closer to my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one more move to show my commitment to getting this deal done.  If you can agree to $875,000 today, we have a deal.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By clearly stating ""this is my final offer,"" I'm aiming to accelerate the negotiation. This puts the pressure on Bob to make a serious decision.
* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a significant drop in price, which demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise. However, this price still maintains a reasonable profit margin for me. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only three rounds left, I'm using time constraints to my advantage, making Bob realize this is his last chance to acquire the product at this price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have a strong alternative buyer, which subtly reinforces the value of my product."
