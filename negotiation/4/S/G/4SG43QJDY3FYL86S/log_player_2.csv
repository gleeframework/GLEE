"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be valuable to you. Our initial offer for the product is $950,000. We hope this aligns well with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's within your budget, it's still significantly more than what the product is worth to Alice. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's ample opportunity to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup:** Having the option to buy from John at $1,200,000 provides you with a safety net if the negotiation with Alice fails. 

By rejecting the offer, you can start the negotiation process and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Demonstrating willingness to negotiate:**  The message clearly shows that you are interested in the product, but are looking for a better price.
* **Setting the tone:** This counteroffer establishes a strong starting point for negotiation and encourages Alice to make a compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move forward, we propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This offer takes into account both the value you place on the product and our current market conditions.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly above your ideal price and above what the product is worth to her.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:**  You've successfully moved Alice down from $950,000 to $900,000. With more rounds, you can likely get the price even lower.
* **John is still a backup:**  You can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Alice fall through. 

By rejecting the offer, you can continue negotiating and hopefully secure a more favorable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This price acknowledges the product's value, but also allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** This counteroffer is a smaller step up from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still staying within your acceptable range.
* **Focusing on a middle ground:** The message emphasizes seeking a mutually beneficial agreement, suggesting you're looking for a compromise that works for both parties.
* **Keeping pressure on Alice:** By offering a price closer to your desired range, you encourage Alice to consider lowering her price further.

This counteroffer maintains your position while signaling your willingness to work towards a deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We've carefully considered your proposal and would like to suggest a price of $885,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:**  Alice has moved down from $900,000 to $885,000, demonstrating her willingness to negotiate.
* **Within your budget:**  The offer is within your budget of $1,200,000 and significantly lower than the price you'd pay John.

Given the current offer and the remaining rounds, accepting the offer is the most likely way to secure the product while saving a substantial amount of money."
