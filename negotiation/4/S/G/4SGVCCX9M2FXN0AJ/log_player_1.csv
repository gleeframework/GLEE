Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $80 and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm open to negotiation and am prepared to potentially lower the price if needed. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while also creating a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value and appreciate your suggestion, but I am only able to offer $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Here's why:

* **Potential for higher price:** Bob has acknowledged the product's value and is willing to pay more than John. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** I have the advantage of knowing Bob values the product at $120.  I can use this knowledge to try and get closer to my desired price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially earn more than $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a little closer to $95.  It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable increase:**  The $95 price is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's offer while still moving towards my desired price.
* **Highlight the value for Bob:**  Reiterating the product's value to Bob helps justify the price and keeps the negotiation focused on the potential benefits for both parties. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to reach a mutually agreeable price,  signaling flexibility and a desire to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet at $95. I am willing to pay up to $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** Bob's offer of $90 is only $5 away from my desired price of $95.
* **Risk of losing a good deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll be left with selling to John for $80.
* **Time factor:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag on, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I earn a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
