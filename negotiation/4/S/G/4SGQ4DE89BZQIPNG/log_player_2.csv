"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, which still leaves a healthy margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered and allows both of us to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your price range, but $1,050,000 is still above your desired maximum. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can secure a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
