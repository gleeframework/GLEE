"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your position, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $9,500? That's a significant move on my part.",9500.0,Bob,4,
