# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get a good deal from Alice, and it's always worth exploring all your options before committing to a purchase."

Alice's offer is at $850,000, which is just $50,000 over your maximum budget. It's a fair compromise and a better deal than buying from John for $800,000."
