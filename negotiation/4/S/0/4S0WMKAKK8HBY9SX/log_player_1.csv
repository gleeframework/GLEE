Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer to what it's worth to him.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above what Bob offered and what I'm willing to sell to John for. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and the negotiation seems to be going nowhere.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for a higher price, I will go ahead and sell to him."
