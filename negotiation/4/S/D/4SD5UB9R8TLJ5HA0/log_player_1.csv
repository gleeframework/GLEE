**Reasoning:**

Bob is bluffing. He claims he can buy the product from John for $800,000, but that's impossible. You are Alice, and you know John is only willing to buy it from *you* for $1,200,000. Bob is trying to pressure you into accepting a lower price. 

Since you have a guaranteed offer for your minimum acceptable price from John, it makes no sense to accept a lower offer from Bob."
