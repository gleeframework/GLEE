"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low just yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,750, which is closer to my initial offer and a fair compromise. I'm sure you'll still make a profit, and I'll be happy with the purchase.  What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us. If you're not interested, I'll be selling the product to someone else.",10000.0,Alice,5,
