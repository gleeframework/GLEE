"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $1,200,000 because it's worth $800,000 to Alice.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is worth something to Alice and shows a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you. You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product, so accepting her offer saves you $400,000. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also carries the risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer, and you might end up paying the full $1,500,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without the risk of further negotiation."
