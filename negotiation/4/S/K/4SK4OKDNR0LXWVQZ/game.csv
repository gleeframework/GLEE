"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value the product brings to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $14,000 is still a little bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $11,500? That seems like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $13,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value the product brings to your business.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I think I can only make this work at $12,000. I understand that's a significant reduction from your initial offer, but I hope you see it as a fair deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a significant reduction, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $12,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value the product brings to your business.",12500.0,Alice,7,
