"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120. This is my best offer for now.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  Could we settle on $95?  I'm really trying to make this work, and I'm sure we can find a solution that's fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make this work, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise at $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you being flexible, but I'm still stuck at $100.  This is my absolute final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with another seller.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final counteroffer.",115.0,Alice,7,
