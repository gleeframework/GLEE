"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can save a significant amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a better price than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has a strong bargaining position as he knows Alice values the product at $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $900,000.  This offer is still above Alice's minimum selling price of $800,000, leaving room for a potential agreement.  By offering a lower price, Bob demonstrates his willingness to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than her initial offer of $900,000, which is not beneficial for Bob.  Despite the counteroffer being rejected, Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to pressure Alice towards a more favorable price point, potentially closer to his desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $875,000. This is still a significant discount from Alice's latest offer of $950,000, but it shows a willingness to compromise. Bob is likely hoping to meet in the middle and find a mutually acceptable price. This strategy could potentially lead to a successful negotiation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is now higher than her initial offer of $900,000.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate further and is trying to push Bob to accept a higher price.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. While this is more expensive, it guarantees a purchase and avoids further negotiations that may not yield a favorable outcome."
