Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's close to my minimum price of $10,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more. I'm confident that Bob will see this offer as fair considering the product's value to him is $15,000.  We'll see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer. It's a good middle ground that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in entirely."
