"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget, and you can potentially get it for even less. Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer of $12,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $14,000, but still within my budget and potentially within a range Alice might accept. This initial counteroffer aims to establish a lower price point and see how Alice reacts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is now very close to my target price, and I am confident I can't get it for much cheaper. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal, especially if Alice is unwilling to budge further.  At this point, accepting the offer secures the product at a good price within my budget."
