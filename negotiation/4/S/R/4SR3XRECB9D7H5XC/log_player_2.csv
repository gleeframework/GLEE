Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.

# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.
