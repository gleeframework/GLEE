"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. It is below my minimum acceptable price. I will try to counteroffer to reach a more reasonable price for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not too far from it. I will try to counteroffer one more time to reach a price close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also still considering selling to John, but I want to see if I can negotiate a slightly better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,375,000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I will need to consider selling to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,375,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but no higher. I really like the product and would like to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Although Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price, it's very close and I don't want to risk losing the deal. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,350,000. This is a decent outcome, and it's better than selling to John at $1,500,000 since I have less time to spend on closing the deal with John."
