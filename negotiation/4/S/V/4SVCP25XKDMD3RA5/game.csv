"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for profit, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for you to still make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This price reflects the true worth of the product while still providing you with a significant return on your investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
