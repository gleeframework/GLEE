Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for you to still make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
