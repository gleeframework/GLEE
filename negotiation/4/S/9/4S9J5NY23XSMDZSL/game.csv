"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $15,500?  This is my final offer.",15500.0,Bob,4,
