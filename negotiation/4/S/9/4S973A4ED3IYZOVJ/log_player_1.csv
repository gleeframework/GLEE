Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in. I've priced it fairly at $925,000.  I believe this is a win-win scenario considering its potential worth to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** The existence of John as a backup buyer isn't explicitly stated, but the confident tone implies you have other options.

This strategy aims for a quick and favorable deal with Bob, but ensures you still get a great price from John if Bob declines."
