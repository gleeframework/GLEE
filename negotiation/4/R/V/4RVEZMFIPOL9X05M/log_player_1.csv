Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Openness:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, signaling that a deal is possible.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm hinting at the product's worth without revealing specifics, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget while leaving myself room to make concessions later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  While $12,500 is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my floor of $10,000. This means there's room for me to potentially get a better price.
* **I want to test Bob's commitment:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge his true interest in the product. If he's genuinely interested, he might be willing to come up in his price.
* **Staying in control:** By rejecting his offer, I remain in control of the negotiation and can set the terms of the next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'd need to come down a bit further to make this work. I'm willing to accept $13,500 for it.  Let me know if that's a good starting point for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Reiterating Value:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's worth by mentioning it being closer to what I had in mind.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I end with an invitation for Bob to continue the discussion, encouraging him to make a counteroffer if needed.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $13,500.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely, as he's already shown a willingness to walk away.
* **Good profit margin:**  $13,000 is still a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this scenario.  It secures a good price and avoids the potential of losing the deal entirely."
