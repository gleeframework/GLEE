Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing a deal above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 provides you leverage. You can afford to be a bit bolder with your initial offer to Bob. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects value and encourages Bob to see the product's worth."
