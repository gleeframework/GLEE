"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Alice's offer is higher than that, so it's better to reject her offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering Alice $8,500, which is still a good deal for her since the product is worth $12,000 to her. 
* This counteroffer is a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying but also want to save as much money as possible.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation if she counters, but still keeping the price below my maximum budget of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it's more beneficial to buy from him.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks a deadlock or even a higher price.  It's time to secure the deal with John."
