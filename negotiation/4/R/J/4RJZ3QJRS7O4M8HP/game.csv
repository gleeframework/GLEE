"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $110, which is still a great deal for you and a fair price for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm firm on $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer at that price.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can do $105, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.
