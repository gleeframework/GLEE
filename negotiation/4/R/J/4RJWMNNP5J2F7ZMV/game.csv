"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10050.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,050 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $11,000. How about $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,200, which is the midpoint between $10,000 and $10,500. Can you consider that?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming up with a compromise.  However, $10,200 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800, which is a bit closer to the price I'm comfortable with. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,6,
