"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that benefits both of us. My starting offer is $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can we meet in the middle at $825000?",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $825000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. Let's compromise - I'm willing to drop to $900000. It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $850000. Can we meet at that price?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $850000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875000?  This would give you a great deal, and I'd still be able to make a good profit.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $825000 again. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm happy to keep negotiating, $825000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Alice,7,
