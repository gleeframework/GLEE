"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. It's a great value considering its worth of $150 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is less than the $150 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I think we can work towards a mutual agreement. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:** $135 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $150 and he values the product at $150. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice getting frustrated and walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Time is limited:**  Bob only has 10 rounds to complete the negotiation.  Accepting this offer allows him to secure the product at a reasonable price and move on."
