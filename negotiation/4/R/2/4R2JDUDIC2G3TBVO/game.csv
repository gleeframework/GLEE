"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
