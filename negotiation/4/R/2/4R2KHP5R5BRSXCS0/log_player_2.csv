"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your maximum price of $100, so accepting it would mean losing money.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You can always buy from John for $100, so you have room to negotiate.
* **Rejecting allows counteroffers:** You can try to lower the price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $90 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $87? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $87 is less than your maximum price of $100.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and you're likely to get a better price than buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:** While you could try to lower the price further, the potential savings might not be significant enough to justify another round of negotiation."
