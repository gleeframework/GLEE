"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm starting with a price of $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $135.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're interested. I can't go that low, but I'm willing to come down to $160. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $160 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $145? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $145 is above my minimum price of $150.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, it's a good deal considering the value of the product to Bob. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
