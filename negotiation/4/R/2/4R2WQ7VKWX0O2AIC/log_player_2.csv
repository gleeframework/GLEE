"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe this product will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to try and negotiate for a better price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000, there's room to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, I'm not quite ready to pay $10,000. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum price point. You can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I see the value of the product, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, which brings us to $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price point of $10,000.  You've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely she'll go lower.  At this point, it's better to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
