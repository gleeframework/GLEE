"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, I'm not quite ready to pay $10,000. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I see the value of the product, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, which brings us to $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business. What are your thoughts?",10250.0,Alice,5,
