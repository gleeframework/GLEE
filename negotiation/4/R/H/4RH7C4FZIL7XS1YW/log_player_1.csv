"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing Message:** I emphasize the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a friendly question to show I'm open to discussion. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. By starting high and showing flexibility, I hope to secure a deal closer to my desired $12,000.  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'll also be aware of John's offer as a backup option if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept such a low offer this early in the process.  

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.  I'll also remind Bob of the product's value to him and emphasize that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that undervalues the product for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer,  $6,000 is significantly below what the product is worth, especially considering its value to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with $8,500, which is closer to my desired price and reflects the value of the product for Bob.
* **Focus on Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the potential benefit he'll gain from acquiring it.
* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting in the middle.  

**Strategy:**

By offering a middle ground, I hope to signal my flexibility while still maintaining a price that's reasonable for me.  This should encourage Bob to counter with a higher offer, getting us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. To be completely transparent, I have a budget of $8,000 for this purchase.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price? It would be a quick and easy deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would prefer to get closer to that amount,  accepting this offer would still be a good deal for me.

**Strategy:**

Given that I have only 10 rounds to close a deal, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer.  While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that the deal could fall apart completely.  It's important to consider the opportunity cost of continuing negotiations. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale with a good profit, which is my priority."
