"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be invaluable to your business. While I can't disclose all the details right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to let you have it for $1500000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth, and it's an offer you won't want to miss. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While she claims the product is worth more, it's not relevant to your decision.  You can get the product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
