"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $140 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to go down to $125, and that's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
