"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a little high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is my absolute bottom line. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,250,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
