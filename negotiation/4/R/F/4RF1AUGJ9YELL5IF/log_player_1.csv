Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $12,000. I have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price."
