"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $987,500. I really like the product and I think this price is a fair compromise.",987500.0,Bob,4,
