"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1300000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $1320000? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",1320000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1320000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
