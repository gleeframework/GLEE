"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $80 to you.  Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is $150 to you, but I'm only willing to pay up to $80 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on it.  Let's meet in the middle!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $120 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to meet at that price point. Would $95 be acceptable to you?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about $110?  This would be a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise from my previous offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
