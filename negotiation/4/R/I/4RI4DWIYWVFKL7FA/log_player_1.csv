{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $80 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my highest desired price. While I know it's likely too high for Bob, it gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit. It also allows me to assess Bob's interest level and see if he's willing to negotiate at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is $150 to you, but I'm only willing to pay up to $80 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  it's significantly lower than what I need to get. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on it.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $120 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to meet at that price point. Would $95 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about $110?  This would be a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise from my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 110}
