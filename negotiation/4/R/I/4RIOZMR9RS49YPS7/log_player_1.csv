Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 price:** This is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation without risking losing the deal entirely.
* **Positive message:** This message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob and creates a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A $100 sale is better than selling to John for $120.
* **Open the door for negotiation:** By starting with a lower price than my minimum, I allow Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal and encourages him to counteroffer.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:**  A higher starting price might lead to immediate rejection from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell for that price, even if it means potentially missing out on a sale to Bob. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer but staying below my minimum. This shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the tone positive to encourage further negotiation.  The message reinforces the value of the product.

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  $95 is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer. 
* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to negotiate increases the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Increase chances of a deal:** A counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and prevents a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, accepting his offer is a good compromise. Here's why:

* **Potential for further negotiation:** If I reject, there's a risk Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John at a lower profit.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on, and I may not get a better offer.
* **Fair price:** $90 is a reasonable price for both of us, allowing Bob to get a good deal and me to make a decent profit.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a price that is above my minimum, ensuring a positive outcome for me."
