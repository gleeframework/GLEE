,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
