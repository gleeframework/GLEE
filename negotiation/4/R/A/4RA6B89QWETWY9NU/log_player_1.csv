"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm starting with an offer of $20,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I believe I can offer $15000 for it, reflecting its true value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. There are 8 rounds left, and I have a safety net with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,500 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $16250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my ideal price. While I could try for a higher price, I'm not sure if he'll budge further.  With 6 rounds left, I'd rather secure this deal and avoid the risk of going lower or losing to John."
