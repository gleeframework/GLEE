"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffers.  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range.  I'm confident I can secure a better price, so I will reject Bob's offer and counter with my own offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering the product at my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates my commitment to selling, but also reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping Bob sees the value and is willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider my options more seriously, including selling to John."
