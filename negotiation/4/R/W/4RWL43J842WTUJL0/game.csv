"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discount.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $862,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. ",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $862,500 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $870,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",870000.0,Alice,5,
