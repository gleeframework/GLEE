"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to my $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Target Price in Mind:** My ideal price is closer to $10,000. By starting at $9,000, I'm aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Polite and Open:** I'm keeping the tone polite and expressing my interest in the product, which can encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This price still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but $10,500 is still above my target price and what John offers. I'll try to inch closer to my goal, knowing I have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle on $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer, but only slightly, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a lower price.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer is almost exactly halfway between Alice's current offer ($10,500) and my previous counteroffer ($9,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  While I'm still negotiating, I'm aware that Alice might not move much lower. This offer tries to strike a balance between getting a good deal and not missing out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,375?  That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial price. While she might come down a little further, it's unlikely she'll reach a point where the deal is significantly better than John's offer of $10,000.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed good deal."
