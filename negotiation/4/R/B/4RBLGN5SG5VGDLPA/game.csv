"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I believe this product would be valuable to my business, but the price point is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your feedback. I understand your position, but $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high. Would you be willing to agree to $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is tempting, I need to get a bit closer to my target price.  How about we settle at $985,000? This feels like a fair deal where we both benefit.",985000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I do value this product and I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $970,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",970000.0,Bob,6,
