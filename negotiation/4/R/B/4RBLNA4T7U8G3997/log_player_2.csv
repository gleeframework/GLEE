"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a better deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  While I'm countering aggressively, I want to maintain a polite and respectful tone with Alice to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Targeting My Range:** My ideal price is significantly lower than Alice's starting point. By countering with $70, I'm aiming for a price within my desired range while acknowledging that I may need to negotiate upward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $70 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to my desired price range, $85 is still significantly higher than my initial offer. This suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** I have the option to buy from John for $100. This provides me with a fallback position and leverage in the negotiation. I'm willing to walk away from Alice's offer if she doesn't come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting we ""split the difference,"" I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $77 is a strong move because:
    * It's closer to my ideal price than Alice's current offer.
    * It shows I'm willing to move up, but not significantly.
    * It puts pressure on Alice to either accept a reasonable offer or risk losing the sale. 
* **Time Consideration:** I'm mindful that each round of negotiation takes time.  I want to make a compelling offer that might encourage Alice to accept and avoid further back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  Let's make this our final offer - $81, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. $81 is a solid price for the product, well within my acceptable range, and significantly cheaper than John's $100 price. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Alice stating this is her final offer indicates she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing for a slightly lower price risks jeopardizing the deal.  It's better to secure a good price now than to potentially lose the opportunity."
