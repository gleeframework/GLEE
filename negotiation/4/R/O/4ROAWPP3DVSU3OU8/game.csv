"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $14500?  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting a little frustrated with this back-and-forth. $13500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $14000 as a final offer.  This is the best I can do.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",14000.0,Alice,7,
