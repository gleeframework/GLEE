"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1800000. It's a steal for the value it provides. I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. Let's talk!",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant value for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1050000. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $1050000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1375000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that this product is worth a lot to me, but $1375000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but I really think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
