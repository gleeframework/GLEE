"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price than $1,200,000.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I believe I can do better."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant value for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1050000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,375,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that this product is worth a lot to me, but $1375000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but I really think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm concerned that if I counteroffer, he might walk away. I'm confident John will buy it, so I'll take the guaranteed deal."
