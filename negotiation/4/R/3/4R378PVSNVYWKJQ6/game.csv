"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair compromise.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is a fair price given the product's value. Let's meet halfway on this.",100.0,Alice,5,
