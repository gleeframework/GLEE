Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum of $80 just yet. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $72 is still slightly below my desired price, it's only a small difference and Bob seems unwilling to budge further. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a complete deal breakdown."
