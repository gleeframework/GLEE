"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's finalize this deal.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $9,000, and that's my final offer. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,6,
