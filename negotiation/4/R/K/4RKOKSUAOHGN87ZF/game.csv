"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to buy the product for $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me on this. I'm still not quite there at $100.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $105? It's a good balance between our prices, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
