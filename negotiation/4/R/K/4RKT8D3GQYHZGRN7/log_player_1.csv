Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I recognize the value of your product, $175 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
