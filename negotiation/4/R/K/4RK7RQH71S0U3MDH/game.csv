"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, my budget for this item is $12000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13500 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to accept $12500 as a final offer? This would be a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $13250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
