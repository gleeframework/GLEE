"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount from her valuation, it's still above your maximum price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to meet you halfway. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value. Let's try to close this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your maximum budget, but still a bit high. You can try to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to $1,000,000, as that's the best price you can afford."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that you're being firm on your budget, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price reflects the value of the product to you while allowing me to recover some of my investment. Let's finalize this deal, I'm sure we can both be happy with this outcome.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000. While it's still over your ideal price of $1,000,000, it's significantly lower than her initial offer of $1,250,000.  You can likely save more by continuing to negotiate, but at this point, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially pushing the price back up is high.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product within your budget, even if it's a slightly higher price."
