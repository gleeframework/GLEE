"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for $110. I think it's a fantastic deal, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $110 is less than your maximum budget of $120, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **More negotiation is likely:** You have 10 rounds to close the deal, so there's time to try and get a lower price.

By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:**  $95 is still above Alice's value of $80, so it's a fair starting point for a counteroffer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's still a $25 difference between your counteroffer and Alice's initial offer, which allows for further negotiation if she rejects. 
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** The message is friendly and shows a willingness to negotiate while establishing your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:**  While closer to your desired price, $102 is still above your ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation before you need to resort to buying from John. 
* **More negotiation is possible:**  You still have 7 rounds left. A few more counteroffers could potentially bring the price down further.

By rejecting this offer, you continue to demonstrate your willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $102 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $98.50. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 98.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:**  $98.50 is a compromise between Alice's offer of $102 and your previous offer of $95. This shows you're willing to meet halfway.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** While close to your ideal price, the counteroffer still leaves a little wiggle room for Alice to counter if needed.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message remains positive and encourages a deal by highlighting the potential for an agreement."
