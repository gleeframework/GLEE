"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to move a bit on price, but $850,000 is lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to get this deal done.  My final offer is $887,500. This is a very strong offer, and I need you to meet me halfway to make this work.",887500.0,Alice,5,
