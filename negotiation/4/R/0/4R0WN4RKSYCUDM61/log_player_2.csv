"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly better than buying from John.  While there's a chance you could get a lower price by counteroffering, there's also a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's more advantageous to accept the guaranteed lower price from Alice."
