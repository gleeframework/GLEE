"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get this product for a little less.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money, but he also wants to buy the product. Alice's offer of $9,250 is closer to his ideal price than John's offer of $10,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his offer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this situation."
