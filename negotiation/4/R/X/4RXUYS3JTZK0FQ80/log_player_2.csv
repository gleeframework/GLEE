"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is attractive, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. The goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying at the initial price would not maximize your savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within a range that might be acceptable.  It reflects a strong desire to save money, but also leaves room for negotiation.  The counteroffer is a good starting point for finding a price that benefits both parties."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're comfortable with.  While you might be tempted to accept, it's worth continuing to negotiate. You're still saving $100,000 compared to buying from John, so the potential for further savings is worth the effort."

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  It's also still lower than Alice's most recent price, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.  This approach aims to find a middle ground that benefits both parties while still saving money."
