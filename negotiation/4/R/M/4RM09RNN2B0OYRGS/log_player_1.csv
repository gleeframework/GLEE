Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique piece that I believe would be a great addition to your collection. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product for $15,000, significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob. This might encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm ending the message with an open-ended question, indicating my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him. 

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob clearly values the product and is willing to pay a significant amount. There's potential for him to go higher.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if he's willing to compromise. 
* **Balancing risk:**  I'm not immediately selling to John because there's a chance I can get a better deal with Bob. However, I'm willing to walk away and sell to John if negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we split the difference at $12,500? This would allow me to move on the sale and give you a great deal on this unique product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with justification:** I'm proposing a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm also providing a reason for this counteroffer, emphasizing the benefit for both of us.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm staying polite and positive, even though Bob rejected my first offer. This helps to keep the negotiations amicable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question, inviting further discussion and potentially leading to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I would be left with only John's offer of $10,000.
* **Time consideration:** Continuing to negotiate might take longer, and I could potentially lose out on other opportunities. 

Taking Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively profitable sale."
