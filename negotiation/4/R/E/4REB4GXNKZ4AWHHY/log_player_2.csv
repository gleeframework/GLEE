While $120 is a good deal, it's still above the product's worth to you. There's room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to negotiate, and $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. There's still room to get a better price, and I have 7 rounds left to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $105? That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$108 is closer to my target, but it's still a bit high. I've got 5 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get that price down even further. I believe there's still room for compromise."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for sticking with this. I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm going to go ahead and offer $106. I think this is a fair offer, considering how close we are to a deal."", ""product_price"": 106}

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to get it lower, I'm getting close to running out of rounds.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but is getting closer to her bottom line.  $109 is a good compromise, and I'm confident I can't get much lower."
