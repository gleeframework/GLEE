"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $850,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
