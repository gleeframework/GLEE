"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your target price of saving as much money as possible. There's potential to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $850,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  It's still a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,000,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a smaller price reduction."
