Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for the product.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your desired price.  While I value the product, $1,150,000 is still above my ideal range. Let's try $1,100,000. This would be a significant price reduction from your initial offer, and I believe it shows my commitment to closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I meet my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1150000 was a bit too high, but I can do $1120000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price:** $1,120,000 is within your budget and a significant drop from Alice's initial offer.
* **You have limited rounds left:**  It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, especially with the threat of having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Alice's offer is likely final:**  She's stated it's her ""final offer.""

By accepting, you save $380,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving."
