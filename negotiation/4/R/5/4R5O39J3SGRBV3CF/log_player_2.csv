"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal. He's willing to pay up to $120, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start with a lower price to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $10 drop is a significant amount, but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This also leaves room for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is only $5 more than Bob's counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, as he's still saving $25 compared to buying from John.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and continuing to reject offers could lead to Alice becoming less willing to negotiate or even increasing her price again."
