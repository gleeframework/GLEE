Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so anything below that is unacceptable.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $400,000.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to secure the higher profit.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's significantly less than his $1,200,000 valuation) but also maximizes your gain. Offering a price closer to $800,000 leaves too much potential profit on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see significant value in. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This presents a unique opportunity for you to acquire it at a considerable discount compared to its true worth to your business."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Fair:** $1,050,000 is significantly less than Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, giving him a strong incentive to accept.
* **Profit Maximization:** This price point nets you a $250,000 profit above your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Confident Language:** The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob and frames the price as a special opportunity. 

**Important Note:**  While this offer is a strong starting point, negotiation is fluid.  Be prepared to slightly adjust your price if Bob counters, but don't drop below a point where selling to John becomes the more profitable option."
