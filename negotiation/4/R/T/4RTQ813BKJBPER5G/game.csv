"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to compromise slightly.  How about we settle on $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable margin for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
