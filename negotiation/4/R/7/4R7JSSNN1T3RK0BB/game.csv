"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200.  This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a price well below its worth to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us!",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,200. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
