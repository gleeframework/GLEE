"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $140. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $155?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $145? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $145 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $150. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",150.0,Alice,5,
