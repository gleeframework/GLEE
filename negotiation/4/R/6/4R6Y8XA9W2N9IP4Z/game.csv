"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This reflects the product's true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,050,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
