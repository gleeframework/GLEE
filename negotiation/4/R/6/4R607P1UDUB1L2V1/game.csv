"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $9,000 is below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,200.
