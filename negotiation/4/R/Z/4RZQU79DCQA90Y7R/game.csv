"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents a premium value proposition, I'm willing to move closer to your offer.  How about we consider $1,900,000?  This reflects my understanding of the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
