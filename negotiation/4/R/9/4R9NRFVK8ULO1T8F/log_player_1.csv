Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's value but below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise that's still above Bob's offer but closer to his value, potentially incentivizing him to accept.  It also keeps me closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's also a better deal than selling to John for $120, considering the effort and potential for further negotiation with Bob."
