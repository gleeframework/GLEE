"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  However, I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. You should try to negotiate a better price.
