Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  However, I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer, increasing the chances of a successful sale.
* **Highlight value:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth without explicitly stating your minimum price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:**  If Bob accepts the initial offer or a negotiated price above $15,000, you gain more.
2. **Secure a quick sale:** By engaging Bob directly, you avoid the potential time and effort involved in selling to John.

While there's a chance Bob might reject the initial offer, it allows you to negotiate from a position of strength knowing you have a backup option."
