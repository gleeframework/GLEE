**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to move significantly from his offer of $1,075,000.  He's repeated this offer twice now, indicating a firm limit. Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting his offer would be a $125,000 loss compared to John's offer. It makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
