"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the current market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This reflects my commitment to making this deal work while ensuring a fair value for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $1,125,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. This price reflects the value I believe the product has, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us. I'm eager to move forward with the deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  However, I need to be upfront â€“  $1,075,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000, but this is my final offer.  I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your position. ",1100000.0,Alice,5,
