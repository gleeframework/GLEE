You can do better than $750,000, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $700,000, which is still a good deal for Alice while saving me $50,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good deal for me. It saves me $75,000 compared to buying from John, and I don't want to risk losing the product by continuing to negotiate."
