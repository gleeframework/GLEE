"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a significant amount. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.

I'll offer Bob the product for $725,000.
