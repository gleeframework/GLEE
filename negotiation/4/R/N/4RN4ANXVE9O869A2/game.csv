"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $2,300,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of this product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still outside my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
