Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $2,300,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still outside my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum threshold. It makes the most financial sense to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
