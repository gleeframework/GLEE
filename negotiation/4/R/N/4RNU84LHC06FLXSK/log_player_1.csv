{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,750,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, aiming for a good profit margin.  I'm also using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While your offer is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $1,650,000? This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
``` 
 
I'm going to counter with a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than my minimum. I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product and the potential for both of us to benefit from a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,650,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,600,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer."
