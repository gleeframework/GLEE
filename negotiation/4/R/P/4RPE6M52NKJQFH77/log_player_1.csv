Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200.  What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Could you consider selling it to me for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is his highest valuation of the product.  It makes no sense to engage in further negotiation. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome for me."
