"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $1,500,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, the value of this product is significant. Could you consider $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it is still above his maximum. It makes sense to try negotiating a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
