This offer is a good starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming to get a price that's closer to your minimum."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $80. It's a fair price considering the product's value and I'd like to make a deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept it! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject it and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
