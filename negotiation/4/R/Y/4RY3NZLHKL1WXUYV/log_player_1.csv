"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar for a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for this product. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $120 is my absolute minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to negotiate him up slightly, there's no guarantee of success. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price without the risk of further negotiation."
