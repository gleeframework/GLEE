"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
