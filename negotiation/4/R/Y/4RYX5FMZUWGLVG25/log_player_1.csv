"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives me some breathing room in case Bob makes a counteroffer that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,550,000. This is halfway between Bob's offer and my desired price. It shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still aim for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to try to negotiate further, but I'm also getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,450,000.  This is a compromise from my last offer and is only $50,000 below what John is offering.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired value and it seems we are not going to meet in the middle. I've already rejected 4 counteroffers and I'm running out of time.  At this point, selling to John is the best option, ensuring I get my minimum value and a guaranteed sale."
