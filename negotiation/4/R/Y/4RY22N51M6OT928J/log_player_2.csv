Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?
