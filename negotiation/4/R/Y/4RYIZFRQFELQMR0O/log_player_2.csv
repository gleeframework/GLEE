"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way too high ($140). It's significantly more than your $100 limit and even more than Alice values it ($120). It makes sense to negotiate down, starting with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for this product."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Significantly Below Valuation:**  Offering $80 is significantly below both Alice's valuation ($120) and your maximum budget ($100). This signals that you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This offer leaves ample space for Alice to counter, and for you to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still above your maximum budget.  You're better off rejecting and seeing if you can negotiate further towards your target.  You always have the option of taking John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That feels like a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but also holds firm below your $100 limit.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** It's close to splitting the difference between your previous offer ($80) and her current offer ($110), signaling a willingness to compromise. 
* **Pressure Point:** By staying below $100, you maintain the option of buying from John if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $90 is still too low for me.  Would you consider $100? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to your maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and risking losing the deal. You've successfully negotiated the price down to a level you're comfortable with."
