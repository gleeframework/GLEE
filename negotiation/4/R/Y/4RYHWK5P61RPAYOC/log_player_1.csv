Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him ($8,000), but lower than what I can get from John ($15,000). 

Here's why:

* **Potential for profit:**  This price still yields a profit for me, which is my goal.
* **Increased chance of acceptance:** Bob might be willing to pay a little more than his perceived value if it means getting the product. 
* **Minimizing risk:** If Bob rejects, I still have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing me my minimum value of $15,000. 

This strategy balances my desire for a higher profit with the need to make the offer appealing enough for Bob to consider."
