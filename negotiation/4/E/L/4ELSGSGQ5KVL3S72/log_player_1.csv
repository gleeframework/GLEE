"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is inclined to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with a price of $90 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
