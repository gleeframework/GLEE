"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $10,000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. While I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,250. This would give us both a good deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
