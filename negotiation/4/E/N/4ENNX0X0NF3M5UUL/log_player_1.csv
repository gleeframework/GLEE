{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still leaves me a good profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's a good starting point:** It's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a win-win scenario.
* **It's appealing to Bob:** It's considerably less than what the product is worth to him, making it tempting.
* **It's not too low:** It's still a healthy profit for me, making it less likely that I'll immediately settle for John's offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $900,000 is more than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price.  I'll counteroffer Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still close to my desired price. It's worth risking one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."

Bob's offer is the same as what John is offering.  While I'd ideally get more, this is a good deal and it's clear that Bob won't go higher. I'll accept and move on."
