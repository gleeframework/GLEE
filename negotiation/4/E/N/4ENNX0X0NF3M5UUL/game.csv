"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still leaves me a good profit. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows me to make a good profit, while offering you a significant discount from what you value the product at. Let's meet in the middle!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. That's a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
