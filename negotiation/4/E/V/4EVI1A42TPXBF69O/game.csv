"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, it's significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price that works for me.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate that you're coming up in your offer. I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal that will benefit everyone involved.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
