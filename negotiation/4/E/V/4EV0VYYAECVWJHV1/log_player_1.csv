Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant amount less than what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum threshold. This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize my profit:**  $1,150,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation.
2. **Initiate the negotiation:** By making the first offer, I set the tone and control the early stages of the negotiation.
3. **Leave room for counteroffers:**  Offering $1,150,000 allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still giving me room to negotiate further.

I'll observe Bob's reaction and be prepared to counter his offer if necessary, keeping in mind the alternative offer from John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and while it's still above John's offer, it's not a good enough price for me to accept. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 

I'll reject his offer and prepare a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to $1,100,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum threshold. This offer is still attractive for Bob, as it's less than he's willing to pay, but allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's latest offer is still lower than I would like, but it's getting closer to my minimum threshold. If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, I risk Bob walking away completely. 

With the offer from John standing at $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer for $1,075,000  secures a better price."
