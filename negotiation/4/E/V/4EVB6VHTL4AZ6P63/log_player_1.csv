I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down from there. If he rejects, I can always lower the price or even go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum price, so I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'll see if I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's offer, hoping to meet halfway. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a profit. If Bob rejects, I can still go to John for my minimum price, so I'm not losing anything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to accept it and close the deal."
