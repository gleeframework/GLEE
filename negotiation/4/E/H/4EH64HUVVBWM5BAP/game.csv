"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price - how about $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks again for the offer. $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, so how about we split the difference and I pay $112.50? Let me know what you think!",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $112.5 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - how about $118.75?  Let's make this deal happen!",118.75,Alice,5,
