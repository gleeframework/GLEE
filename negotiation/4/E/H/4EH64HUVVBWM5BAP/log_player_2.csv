"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget of $100. It's best to reject and counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price - how about $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $125 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  Rejecting and counteroffering again gives you a chance to get closer to your target price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for the offer. $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, so how about we split the difference and I pay $112.50? Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $112.5 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - how about $118.75?  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to your price, $118.75 is still above your $100 limit.  It's not worth risking further negotiation as you've already had several rounds and John offers a guaranteed price within your budget."
