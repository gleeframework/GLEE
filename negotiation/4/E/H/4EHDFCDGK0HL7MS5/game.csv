"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,800 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $12,200.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
