"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly less than what I believe this product is worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my best offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm definitely interested, but $1,300,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to accept a slight compromise and lower my price to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
