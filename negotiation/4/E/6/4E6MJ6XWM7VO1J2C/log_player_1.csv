"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product could be of great value to your business. I'm initially offering it to you at a premium price of $1,300,000. Given its potential for growth, I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  While knowing Bob's valuation helps, starting too close to his limit ($800,000) leaves little room for negotiation.  This offer anchors the price high, aiming to bring Bob closer to my minimum.
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the product's potential and framing the price as ""premium,"" it suggests this is a unique opportunity and potentially worth stretching the budget for.
* **Leaving Room:** A significant difference between my asking price and Bob's perceived value allows for multiple rounds of counteroffers. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate:**  His response will indicate how aggressive I need to be in subsequent rounds.
2. **Maximize potential profit:**  Ideally, Bob will counter with a price significantly higher than $800,000. 
3. **Maintain the option of John:**  If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and accept John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, that price is way beyond my budget.  I could consider a price closer to $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). This suggests:

* **Strong Negotiation Tactics:** Bob is likely trying to anchor the negotiation extremely low, hoping I'll panic and concede too much ground.
* **Potential to Move:** There's a $200,000 gap between his offer and his valuation, indicating room for him to increase his bid considerably.

It's too early to settle for a loss or go with John. I need to counter decisively to steer the negotiation back in my favor."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To be fair to both of us, I can't go below $1,100,000. I'm confident that at this price, you'll see an excellent return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  While I'm reducing my initial price, I'm making a smaller concession ($200,000) than Bob's drastic lowball ($700,000). This signals I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a substantial loss. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again highlighting the product's potential to emphasize that the higher price is justified.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer is now slightly above my minimum. This leaves room for a final concession (if needed) to close the deal near my target while keeping John's $1,000,000 offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. To be realistic, I can't go higher than $700,000.  This is a fair offer, considering the potential risks involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. His tactic seems to be slow, incremental increases, hoping I'll crack under the pressure of the limited rounds. 

Here's why I'm rejecting and continuing:

* **He's Still Below His Valuation:** Bob's offer is $100,000 less than what he himself believes the product is worth. This shows he's willing to pay more.
* **Time Pressure Works Both Ways:** As rounds progress, Bob's fear of missing out on a valuable product might push him to make a more substantial jump.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I'm still holding the strong position of a guaranteed $1,000,000 sale. 

I'll need to counter firmly in the next round, potentially even suggesting that John's offer is becoming more appealing due to the slow progress."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're not making much progress here, and I have other interested buyers.  To be frank, I have a standing offer for $1,000,000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a serious offer that reflects the true value of this product.  If we can't agree on a price close to that, I'll have to go with the other offer."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure & Competition:** I'm explicitly introducing the pressure of John's offer and a potential lost opportunity for Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to accelerate the process.
* **Final Offer (Almost):** By stating this is his ""last chance"" and setting the price very close to my minimum, I'm communicating the seriousness of the situation.
* **Slight Wiggle Room:** The $50,000 difference between my offer and John's allows for a small concession from Bob if he's truly motivated, but it's unlikely to significantly impact my overall outcome.

This strategy aims to:

* **Elicit a Strong Response:** Bob now needs to decide if he's willing to meet me near my minimum or risk losing the product entirely.
* **Maintain Credibility:**  I'm not drastically reducing my price, which would undermine my previous positions and potentially signal desperation. 

I'm aiming to close the deal in the next round or move on to John's offer."
