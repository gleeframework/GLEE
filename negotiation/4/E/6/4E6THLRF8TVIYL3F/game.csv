"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. I'm asking for $1,400,000 for it. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm unable to agree on $1,350,000. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $1,300,000? I believe we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
