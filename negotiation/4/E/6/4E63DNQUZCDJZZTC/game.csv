"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $92.50?  It's a good deal for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $88.50.  This would allow us both to get a fair deal.",88.5,Bob,4,
