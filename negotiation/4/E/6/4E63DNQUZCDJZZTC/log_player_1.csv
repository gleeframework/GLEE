Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting at my desired price point, knowing that it's above his perceived value.  However, I'm hoping that the product is valuable enough to him that he'll consider it. I also want to be open to negotiation, hence the open-ended question."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality, $100 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $85 is a better offer than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $92.50?  It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $88.50.  This would allow us both to get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $88.50 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum of $100.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. It's a better deal for me, and I don't want to risk getting stuck at a lower price point if we continue negotiating with Bob."
