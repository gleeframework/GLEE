Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point.  By offering $100, I'm aiming high but leaving room for negotiation. I also acknowledge that Bob might have a different idea of the product's value. This keeps the communication open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $70 is below my minimum price of $80. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $85 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. Bob's offer of $77.5 is still below my minimum price of $80. While I'm open to negotiation, it seems like we're reaching a stalemate. It's better to secure the guaranteed $80 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with less."
