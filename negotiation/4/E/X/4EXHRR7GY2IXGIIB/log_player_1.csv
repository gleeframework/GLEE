Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I'm hoping to get.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I believe there's room for a better counteroffer from Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, giving me a safety net."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,050,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $1,000,000, even with his increased offer.
* **Limited Time:**  With only four rounds left, I need to be strategic. I don't want to risk accepting a price below my minimum if I might get a better offer in the next few rounds.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he's expressed a desire to reach an agreement.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always a secure option if negotiations fail."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I understand you're working within budget constraints.  However, I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $995,000. This is a small compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 10
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's final offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **No More Rounds:** This is the last round of negotiation, and I can't make any further counteroffers.
