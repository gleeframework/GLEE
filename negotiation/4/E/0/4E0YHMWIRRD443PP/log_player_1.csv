"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Show Confidence:**  A strong opening offer conveys that you believe in the product's value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,300,000 offer leaves a significant margin for negotiation while still being well above your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while remaining aware that Bob has a strong incentive to buy at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's counter-offer suggests he's very interested and willing to pay a significant amount. Rejecting keeps the door open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's clear you recognize the product's value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,175,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're coming down significantly from $1,300,000 to $1,175,000, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** However, we're not meeting him in the middle ($1,150,000). This signals that we still value the product highly and are aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive Language:** Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" and emphasizing the ""true worth"" maintains a collaborative tone while subtly anchoring the price point above Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is the highest I can go. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 is a significant profit above our $800,000 minimum. 
* **""Highest I can go"":** Bob's language suggests this is his final offer, and further negotiation might be fruitless. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds left, there's always a risk Bob walks away. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
