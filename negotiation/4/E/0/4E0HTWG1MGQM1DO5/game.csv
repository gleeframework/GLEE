"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"That's a great offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but I'd need to see it come down a bit more to make it work for me. How about $7,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,500. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a little hesitant about $8,250. Would you consider $8,000? That's still a good price for you, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to go down to $8,100. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
