"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and much higher than my minimum price. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $810,000 for your product. I believe this is closer to its true value and still offers a good deal for both of us.",810000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $810,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further from my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I still feel that $810,000 was a fair compromise. I am willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $875,000. This is a reasonable price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
