"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product. I've priced it competitively at $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This represents a significant discount and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's a win-win situation. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price while still giving you a good deal. Let's close this deal before we run out of time.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
