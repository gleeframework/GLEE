Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, which I believe is worth at least $10,000 to me.  However, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  $9,500 allows for a possible counteroffer from Bob without me dropping below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** By starting the negotiation, I keep the option open to sell to John if Bob's counteroffer is unacceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While $8,200 is closer to my minimum of $10,000, I am still not willing to sell at that price.
* **I want to see if I can get a higher offer.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter-offer and try to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob continue to be unproductive, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,200 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet.  Considering the value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $9,000.  This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Within Range:** I'm offering a price that's still above Bob's offer but below my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counter-offer and encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Focusing on Profit:** I'm framing the negotiation around a mutually beneficial deal, emphasizing profitability for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Offer:** I believe there's room for a higher counter-offer from Bob. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **John is a Backup:** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $10,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However,  $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? This price is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  By offering $8,750, I'm proposing a price that's almost exactly in the middle of our last two offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the counter-offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity and encouraging him to see the value in the deal. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** This counter-offer is still above my absolute minimum, so I'm not giving up too much, but it also leaves room for one more potential counter-offer from Bob before I'd consider selling to John."
