"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, which I believe is worth at least $10,000 to me.  However, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Can you meet me there?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,200 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet.  Considering the value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $9,000.  This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However,  $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? This price is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",8750.0,Alice,5,
