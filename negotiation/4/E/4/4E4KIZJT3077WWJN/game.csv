"Hey Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but  $150 is a little out of my budget. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I know that this product is worth at least $120 to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,5,
