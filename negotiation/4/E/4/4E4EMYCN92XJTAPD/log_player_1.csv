{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. I know I can get it for that price elsewhere, but I'd prefer to deal with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
