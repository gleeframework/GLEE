Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've done my best to meet you halfway, but unfortunately, I cannot go above $13,000. Could you possibly reconsider your offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

```

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly stuck at $13,000 and doesn't seem likely to budge.  It's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate him up significantly in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer means losing out on $2,000 compared to John's offer. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
