"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Considering its quality and features, I'd like to offer it to you for $95. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) to see how much negotiating room Alice has. This leaves space for me to gradually increase my offer if needed.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is courteous and expresses my interest, but it also clearly states my desired price point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $80, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary and buy from John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and would like to try to find a middle ground. How about considering the product for $85? This is a bit higher than your offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to my price, but there's still a chance to get a better deal. I'll offer a compromise between our last offers to see if we can settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about meeting halfway at $82.50?"",
""product_price"": 82.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By offering $82.50, I'm splitting the difference between my last offer ($80) and her counteroffer ($85). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a fair price.
* **Staying Below Budget:** This offer keeps me well below my $100 maximum, leaving room for a potential final concession if needed. 
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is concise and directly proposes a specific compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, how about we agree on $83.75? This is slightly above your last offer and below my initial asking price, aiming for a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly set on a price above $82.50.  The potential savings from continuing the negotiation (a little over a dollar) are not worth the risk of her increasing her price or the deal falling through.
* **Good Deal:** $83.75 is a solid price, well below my $100 budget and a significant discount from her initial offer. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forth and secures the product for me."
