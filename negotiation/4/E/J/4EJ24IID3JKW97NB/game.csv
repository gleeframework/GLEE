"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,850,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,850,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? ",1450000.0,Bob,4,
