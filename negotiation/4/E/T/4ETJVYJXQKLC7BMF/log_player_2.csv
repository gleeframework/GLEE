"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than its worth to you. If we can't agree on this price, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She claims she'll sell the product for less than it's worth to her if you reject her offer, which is not a rational business decision. By rejecting her offer, you call her bluff and open the possibility of getting a better price.  While you could buy from John immediately, there's a chance Alice will come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale."
