{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has now stated this is his highest offer. Accepting $1,225,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($1,000,000) and continuing to negotiate risks him lowering his offer or us needing to settle for John's offer as we get closer to the round limit."
