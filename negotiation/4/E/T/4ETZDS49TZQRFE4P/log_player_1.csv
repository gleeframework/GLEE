Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,500 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can lower the price slightly if Bob counteroffers, but you still have a cushion to work with.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep the negotiation open and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:** While accepting it would secure a sale, it's only your minimum acceptable price.  
* **There's room for a counteroffer:** You can still potentially get more from Bob by countering. 
* **Selling to John is the same price:**  There's no immediate advantage to selling to John at this moment. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain the opportunity to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand it's a bit high for you. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $12,000 is just too low. How about we split the difference at $13,250? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than your minimum:**  $13,250 is still above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It's midway between your previous offer of $14,500 and Bob's offer of $12,000.
* **It shows flexibility:** This demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

By offering this counter-offer, you're continuing the negotiation in a way that shows you're serious about making a deal but still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $13,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $12,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum:** $12,500 is only $500 away from your minimum acceptable price.
* **Selling to John yields the same price:** There's no immediate advantage to selling to John as Bob's offer is only slightly higher.
* **Negotiation may stall:**  Continuing to counter-offer might lead to a stalemate, potentially losing the sale altogether. 

While it's not your ideal price, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and ensures a reasonable profit. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and the risk of losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
