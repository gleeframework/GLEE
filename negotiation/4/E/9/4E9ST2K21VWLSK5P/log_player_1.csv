Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a strategic starting point. Offering $15,000 is a reasonable increase from your minimum value ($12,000), potentially making the product appealing to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation if he counter-offers.  If Bob rejects, you can always fall back on John's $12,000 offer."
