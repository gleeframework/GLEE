Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'll try to get it for a price that's closer to that value.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's offer of $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get closer to the product's value to Alice, which is $800,000. I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's last offer, but still a bit higher than my previous offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $825,000 is a more reasonable price. I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 825000}"
