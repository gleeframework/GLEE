"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice you're serious about buying, but also that you're not willing to accept her first price. $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from her initial offer, and is still within your budget. This hopefully encourages her to negotiate further without you having to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my previous counteroffer, but still below my maximum budget.  I will continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a lower price.  It's still significantly lower than her offer, and I'm hoping she'll be more inclined to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is steadily decreasing the price, it's still not within my desired range. I'm still hoping to get a better deal, so I will reject the offer and continue to negotiate.  It's getting closer to my maximum budget, but there's still room for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping it well below Alice's current offer. I'm hoping this shows her I'm serious about buying the product, and that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  We're getting closer, and I'm optimistic that we can reach an agreement within the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I believe I can still negotiate a lower price with Alice. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but it's still within my budget.  I'm getting closer to Alice's offer, and I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to reach a compromise.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting dangerously close to my maximum budget. While I could continue to negotiate, it's risky to gamble on Alice accepting my next counteroffer, especially with only one round left.  Given the current state of negotiations, it's more prudent to buy from John at $1,500,000 and ensure I get the product within my budget."
