"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is still too high. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the  product has significant potential beyond that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. I'd like to see if we can meet at that price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
