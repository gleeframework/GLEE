"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  You can buy the product for $140 from Alice, which is cheaper than John's price of $150. 
* **You can still save money:**  Even though Alice's offer is above your ideal price of $120, it's still a good deal compared to buying from John."
