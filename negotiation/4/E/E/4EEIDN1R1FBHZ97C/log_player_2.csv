"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows me to start the negotiation process and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher figure. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $925,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my desired price point.  I'm aiming to get as close to $800,000 as possible.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $925,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
