"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is less than John's price of $100, you know you can potentially get the product for a better price. There's room to negotiate or see if Alice will lower her price further."
