Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible, but I'm also aware that Bob might walk away. 
* By starting with a higher price and leaving room for negotiation, I create an opportunity for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* I'm prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial offer, and I'm also ready to walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, even though John's offer guarantees me $15,000. I'm going to try to get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price point, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $11,500 to see if we can make this work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $11,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still leaves room for profit and keeps me above my minimum value.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints and expressing willingness to compromise. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is a calculated move, balancing the need to get a decent price with the desire to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 
* I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if he rejects it.
* This counteroffer also helps me gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and understand his negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach an agreement. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final offer of $11000 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to come to a satisfactory conclusion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 

Given that John is offering me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's a much better option for me to sell to John. 

**Strategy:**

This decision is driven by risk aversion.  While there's a chance that I could continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price, it's not a guaranteed outcome. John's offer provides a guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of losing out on a better deal."
