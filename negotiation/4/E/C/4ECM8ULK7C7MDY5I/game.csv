"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $7,000. Can you consider this price?",7000.0,Bob,4,
