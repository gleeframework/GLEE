{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message highlights the value to Bob and emphasizes the potential for a good deal.
* **Flexibility:**  The message leaves the door open for negotiation, signaling a willingness to find common ground.
* **Plan B:** The option to sell to John for $8,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above minimum:** $8,500 is still above my minimum of $8,000, so it's a good starting point for the next round. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the value for Bob and the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Clear call to action:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $7,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  There is very little room for further negotiation, and Bob seems unwilling to budge significantly.
* **John's offer is a secure option:**  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees my minimum price and avoids further negotiation that might not result in a better outcome."
