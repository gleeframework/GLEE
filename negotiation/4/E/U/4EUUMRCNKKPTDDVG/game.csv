"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $200, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the thought, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're trying to stay within a budget, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120?  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I'm not able to meet you at $120, I would like to propose $95 as my maximum offer. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm flexible. Let's split the difference - how about $107.50?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're finding common ground, Alice. Considering your flexibility, I'd like to counter with $105. I believe this offers a fair compromise while staying within my budget.",105.0,Bob,6,
