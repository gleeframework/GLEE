"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you! Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit above my budget with $90. How about we meet at $87.50? That's the lowest I can go.,87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $89.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $89 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $89, so how about $88.75?",88.75,Bob,6,
