"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,075,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let me know if that works for you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
