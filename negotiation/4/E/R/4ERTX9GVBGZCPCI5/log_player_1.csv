I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $985,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle yet. I have John as a backup, and I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob in the next round."

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, I'm running out of time and I'm not sure if I can push him to my minimum price.  It's better to accept the guaranteed offer from John and ensure I get at least $1,000,000 for my product."
