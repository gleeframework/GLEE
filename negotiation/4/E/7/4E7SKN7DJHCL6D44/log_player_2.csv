Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice is clearly unwilling to go down to her break-even point of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll dig in further, and I'm already getting a significant discount. Accepting $1,050,000 is a good deal for me."
