{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm asking $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than my minimum ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value to Bob:** I know Bob values the product at $15,000, so this price is still attractive to him.
* **Negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially allowing me to reach a price closer to his valuation.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob isn't willing to negotiate, I can always go with John's offer of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** While I could sell to Bob for $10,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Value to Bob:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's still a gap between our valuations.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm confident I can get a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:**  John is a reliable backup option if this negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  That's still a good price for this incredible product, and I think it would be a great value for you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value to Bob:**  $11,000 is still well below Bob's valuation of $15,000, making it a good deal for him.
* **Further Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for more negotiation if Bob still wants a lower price.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $10,000."
