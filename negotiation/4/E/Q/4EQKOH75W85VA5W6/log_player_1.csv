{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it! I'm asking for $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $120, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging to keep the conversation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate you taking an interest in the product. I can go down a bit, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by reducing the price to $115. I'm also emphasizing that it's a fair price for both of us, hoping to appeal to his sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still looking to keep my spending within my budget. Could you consider $110 as the final price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $110 is close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I can go down to $112, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit more to $112, but emphasizing that this is my final offer. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to hopefully encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm glad we could narrow down the price. I would like to propose $110 as the final price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is persistent with his offer of $110, and I've already lowered my price twice.  While I could try to counteroffer again, I'm concerned that we're getting stuck in a pattern, and I'm not sure if we'll ever reach an agreement.  

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable value of $120, I'm going to sell the product to John. It's not the highest price I could have gotten, but it's a reliable and certain sale."
