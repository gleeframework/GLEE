Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to start with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $115 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, potentially still landing above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Alternative Option:** I am keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100, so I won't accept any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $108. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $108 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and closer to Bob's initial counter. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price and encourage him to move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $108 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $112?"",
""product_price"": 112
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've come down from my initial offer ($115) to show willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:** $112 represents a compromise, splitting the difference between his offer ($108) and my previous price.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  This price still ensures a profit above my minimum while hopefully being enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Gain vs. Risk:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $110 is only $2 less than my last counteroffer. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiation adds uncertainty and delays the sale. 
* **Profitable Deal:** Accepting $110 still gives me a $10 profit over my minimum acceptable price. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale by being overly aggressive in my pricing."
