"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment for you. Given its potential value, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our interests. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is appreciated, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $1,025,000. This price is fair, allows you a decent profit, and keeps me within my budget.  Let's work together to get this deal done.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  While $1,025,000 is a step in the right direction, it still falls short of my minimum expectation.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $1,075,000.  This price recognizes the value this product holds for you while allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal. ",1075000.0,Alice,5,
