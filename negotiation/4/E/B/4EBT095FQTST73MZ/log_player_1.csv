Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product without revealing specifics. This creates a sense of desirability and justifies the high price.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

By starting high and creating a sense of urgency, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a deal significantly above her minimum acceptable price."
