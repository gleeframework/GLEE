"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500.  If that's not acceptable, I'll need to go with another seller.",8500.0,Bob,4,
