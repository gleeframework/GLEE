"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! $200 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit above John's price.  Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about $130? That's a fair bit closer to my budget."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

We're splitting the difference again with this counter-offer. This keeps us moving towards a possible agreement, while still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's original offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $150 is the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has met your bottom line. There's no point in continuing to negotiate or going with John, as they offer the same price."
