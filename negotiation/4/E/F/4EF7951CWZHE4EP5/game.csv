"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we possibly settle around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",13000.0,Alice,5,
