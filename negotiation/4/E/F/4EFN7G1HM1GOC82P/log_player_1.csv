"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value. I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a bit extra since it's worth $8,000 to him.  I'll also be ready to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,500 is below my minimum threshold, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit below your latest offer. How about we meet at $7,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $7,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm confident we can reach a better agreement with some more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we split the difference at $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
