"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your product is worth $15,000 to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?  This price still leaves you with a profit, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not able to meet your asking price of $12,500. My maximum budget remains at $12,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $12,250. This is a small compromise on my end, and I hope it's a reasonable offer for you. I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,5,
