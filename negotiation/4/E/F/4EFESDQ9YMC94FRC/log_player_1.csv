Round 2
Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130?  It's a fair compromise that still lets me make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 130}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $130 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115. This allows for a decent profit for you, and it's a price I can comfortably afford. What do you think?
