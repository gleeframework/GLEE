Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run.  I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential impact on your business."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High but Negotiable:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's benefits and long-term value aims to justify the high price and sway Bob's decision."
