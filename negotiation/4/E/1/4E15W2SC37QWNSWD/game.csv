"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is far too low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still represents a good value for you, as it's below the product's worth to you.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to my budget, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,000, which still reflects the value of the product to you. This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else.  What's your decision?",8000.0,Alice,5,
