"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is still a great price for the product. I think it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is still a great price for the product. I think it's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,7,
