Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go to $1250000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm confident that this price is fair, considering the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're making progress, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1400000, which is a fair compromise considering the potential value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

We're down to the wire, and while Bob is getting closer, I'm not confident we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with in the remaining rounds.  John's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum, and it's a safe bet that I can secure that amount.  I'll take John's offer."
