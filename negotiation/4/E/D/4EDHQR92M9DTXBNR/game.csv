"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's still a great deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you need to stay within your budget, but this product is worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This would give us both a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Can we consider that?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
