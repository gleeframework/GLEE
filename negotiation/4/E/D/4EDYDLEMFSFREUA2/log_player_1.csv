{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good discount while still leaving me with a profit of $1,500. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept it.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is a good compromise. It's a bit lower than my initial goal, but it's still a significant profit and better than selling to John.  I'm going to accept his offer and finalize the deal."
