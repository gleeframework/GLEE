"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to make a deal that benefits both of us. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* Accepting this offer saves you $400,000 compared to buying from John. 

It's always better to get a better deal, even if Alice is using some sales tactics in her message."
