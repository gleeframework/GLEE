Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works. My final offer is $12,000. This is a great price considering the value you'll get, and I'm confident you won't regret it.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is presenting her ""final offer"".  While I could try to haggle further, there's a risk she'll hold firm and I'll end up having to buy from John at $15,000. Accepting $12,000 secures a good price and avoids that risk."
