"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.  Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $720,000? That's a fair compromise between our two positions.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $720,000 is still far below what this product is worth.  To be honest, I'm considering selling it to John for $1,500,000. However, I'd rather work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,100,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
