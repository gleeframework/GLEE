Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.  Let me know if you're interested.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $720,000 is still far below what this product is worth.  To be honest, I'm considering selling it to John for $1,500,000. However, I'd rather work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,100,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her current price. Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option to ensure you stay within your budget."
