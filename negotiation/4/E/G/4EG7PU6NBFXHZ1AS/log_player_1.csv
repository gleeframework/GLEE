Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a balance between maximizing my profit and enticing Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **The message:** I've included a friendly message that frames the price as ""fair"" and invites Bob to respond. This helps to create a positive tone and encourages further engagement. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and his negotiating style. If I feel the negotiation is going nowhere, I can always switch to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and it's also below his own perceived value of $800,000.  

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price. It's important to remember that I can always switch to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls or if I feel like I'm not going to get a good enough price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $600,000. It's still above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and encourages further conversation.
* **The message:** I've framed the counteroffer as a concession, highlighting my willingness to compromise. This helps to maintain a positive negotiating tone and puts pressure on Bob to consider my offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move.  It signals my commitment to negotiating with Bob while still maintaining a price point that is significantly higher than his initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reconsider my options and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or to sell to John for the guaranteed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $720,000? That's a fair compromise between our two positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $720,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000 at this point, especially considering John is ready to buy it for $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully push him closer to my desired price range. If Bob is truly serious about purchasing the product, he'll need to increase his offer significantly.  If he continues to stall or offers a price that's too low, I can always switch to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $720,000 is still far below what this product is worth.  To be honest, I'm considering selling it to John for $1,500,000. However, I'd rather work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,100,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:**  This counteroffer is a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a clear signal that I'm serious about working with Bob but won't accept a ridiculously low price.  
* **The message:**  I've added a subtle element of pressure by mentioning John's offer. This reinforces my position and encourages Bob to take my offer seriously. The message also emphasizes my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, further pushing Bob to compromise.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move. I'm aiming for a final price close to my minimum acceptable price while still maintaining a positive and collaborative tone. If Bob rejects this offer, I can use John's offer as leverage to get a more favorable price from Bob or simply switch to John and avoid further negotiation.  This approach gives me the best chance to maximize my profit while keeping the option open to work with Bob if it's beneficial."
