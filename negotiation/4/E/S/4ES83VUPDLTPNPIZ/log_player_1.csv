Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 4

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000."
