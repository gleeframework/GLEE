Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $15,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay. There's no benefit to negotiating further with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting John's offer ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
