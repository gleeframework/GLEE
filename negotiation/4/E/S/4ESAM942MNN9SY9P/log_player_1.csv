Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,999,999. "",
""product_price"": 1999999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I can afford to start with a very high offer to Bob.  
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer is about maximizing profit. It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. I can always come down in price, knowing I have John as a backup.
* **Psychological pricing:** The price is just below $2,000,000, which might make it seem more appealing than a flat $2,000,000. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to maintain a professional and polite tone throughout the negotiation, regardless of the price offered."
