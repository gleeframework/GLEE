At this point, it makes sense to offer slightly more than your initial offer. This signals to Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are still willing to negotiate.  It's a good compromise between saving money and not losing the opportunity completely."

Alice's offer is still higher than what you are willing to pay.  You've tried to negotiate a lower price but it seems she's not willing to go any lower.  At this point, it's best to go with John's offer to avoid losing more time and money."
