Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position,  $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure a fair return. How about we split the difference at $1250000? This allows for a reasonable negotiation point for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is still below what I consider a fair price for this product.
