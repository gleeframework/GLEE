Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $145 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a larger profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but it's not so outrageous that it would immediately scare him off. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a guaranteed sale to John if needed."
