"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him, $12,500 is below my minimum price. I have 8 rounds left to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $13,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to make a deal with him. It's getting close to my minimum price, and it's unlikely he'll offer more."
