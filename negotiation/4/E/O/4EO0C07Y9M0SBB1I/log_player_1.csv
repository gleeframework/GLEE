Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's value for the product, but still below your minimum. This gives you room to potentially negotiate higher if Bob is willing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm only willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $95.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to counter with $92 for the product. Let me know if this is feasible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is offering $92, which is closer to your desired price of $100. While it's still below your minimum, the risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower price or even rejection, potentially forcing you to sell to John at $120. Accepting Bob's offer is the most reasonable choice as it secures a profit for you and avoids potential losses."
