Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than what the product is worth to me ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation but still ensures I make a profit. Offering $14,000 allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to negotiate. 

If Bob rejects, I can then assess if I want to continue negotiations with him or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than the product's worth to him ($10,000), it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). I'm rejecting his offer because it's not worth my time to continue the negotiation at that price. 

I'm choosing to reject and make a counteroffer because there's a chance I can still get a better price from Bob. It's also a way to signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is still a profit for me, and it shows a willingness to compromise while still holding onto some of my initial asking price. This allows for further negotiation without sacrificing too much of my desired margin."
