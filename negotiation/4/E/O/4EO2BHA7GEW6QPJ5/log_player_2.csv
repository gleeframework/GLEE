"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice might accept a lower price, especially since she values the product at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $10,000.  A counteroffer of $12,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's offer, while still being a potentially acceptable price for Alice considering her valuation of $15,000. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still giving Bob a good chance of getting a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to her initial offer of $14,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price, and the risk of ending up paying $10,000 to John is too high. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for Bob while minimizing the risk of a worse outcome."
