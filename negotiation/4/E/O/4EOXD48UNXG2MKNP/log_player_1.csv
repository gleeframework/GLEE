Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that aligns with your needs. While the market value is significantly higher, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** Offering $1,200,000 is a compromise. It's significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000) but still allows me to earn more than if I sold to John.
* **Message:**  The message highlights the value to Bob, emphasizes the potential savings, and focuses on a fair deal. 
* **Negotiation:** This offer provides an opening for negotiation. Bob might be willing to pay more, but I'm still prepared to sell to John if the deal doesn't work out."
