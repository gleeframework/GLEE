"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $11,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we're trying to find a fair price, Alice. While $13,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could we do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a significant gap from what I had in mind.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I understand this is your final offer, but could you meet me halfway at $12,000? This is a fair price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
