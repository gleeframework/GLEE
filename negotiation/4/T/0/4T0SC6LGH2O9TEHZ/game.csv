"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",9800.0,Bob,4,
