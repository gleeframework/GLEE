Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product offers.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
