"I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $950,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for the value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
