Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than the product's worth to me. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired value."
