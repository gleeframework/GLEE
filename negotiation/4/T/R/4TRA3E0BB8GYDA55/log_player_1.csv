Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking $200 for it."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $150 for it, which is within your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, and it matches the price John is offering. There's no benefit to further negotiation.
