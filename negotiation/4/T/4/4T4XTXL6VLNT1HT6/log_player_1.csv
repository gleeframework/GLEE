"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000.  This is a strong opening that leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so there's a chance he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is close to the product's value to him, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good price for me.  It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not willing to accept a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. There's a possibility he'll increase his offer again, and I'm willing to keep negotiating for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm reducing my counteroffer to $1,050,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation of the product, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm getting nervous about the time limit and the risk of not closing a deal. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity."
