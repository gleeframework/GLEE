"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like it's a good deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to make Bob more interested.

I'm also aware that I can always fall back to John's offer of $120 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but there's still room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Strategic Approach:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While $150 is decent, I'm not desperate to sell. I can always fall back to John's offer, so there's minimal risk in continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $165. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 165}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and making a counter-proposal that's closer to his price but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and enthusiastic to maintain a good rapport. 

By doing this, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to go too low just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $155 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $155 is very close to my target price. It's only $5 below my previous counteroffer and well above my minimum of $120.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price, or Bob could walk away completely. 
* **Time Factor:**  We're already in round 4, and the risk of getting a lower price or no deal increases with each round.

Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good price without jeopardizing the deal."
