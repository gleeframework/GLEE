Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 130}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $110. Since $110 is lower than the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my minimum value. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 125}

I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and be willing to meet me in the middle. If not, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or sell the product to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob rejected my initial offer and made a counteroffer of $110, and I rejected that and made a counteroffer of $125. Now it's Bob's turn again!

Bob's counteroffer is...?

Let me think for a moment... I'll make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my minimum value. Here it is:

{""product_price"": 122}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer or get closer to my minimum value. If not, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or sell the product to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my third offer, and now he's made another counteroffer of $115. Since $115 is still lower than my minimum value, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my minimum value. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 118}

I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and be willing to meet me in the middle. If not, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or sell the product to John for $120."

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my minimum value. However, I'll also consider the fact that Bob has been moving closer to my minimum value, and I might need to make a more significant concession to reach an agreement. Here's my response:
