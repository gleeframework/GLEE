,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $9250?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $9250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9250 and $7000, which would be $8125. Would you be willing to accept that price?",8125.0,Bob,4,
