Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive framing:** Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""happy"" aims to build positive sentiment with Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, setting the stage for potential counteroffers.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and my understanding of his perceived value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $8,000 for the product. Selling to John at that price is a guaranteed outcome. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but there's still room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Testing Bob's willingness:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to see if he's truly interested in the product and willing to pay more. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price higher than $8,500, aiming to find a compromise closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,250?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but immediately offering a counter-proposal to keep the negotiation moving.
* **Splitting the difference:**  My counter-offer of $9,250 is a middle ground between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasizing value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to reinforce that my offer is fair. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I end with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially leading to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $9250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9250 and $7000, which would be $8125. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,125 is only $125 above my minimum price of $8,000.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even though I'm accepting the offer, I still have a chance to potentially push for a slightly higher price in the next round.  
* **Avoiding risk:**  It's likely Bob won't go higher, and selling to John guarantees $8,000. Accepting Bob's offer secures a slightly better price with a lower risk of ending up with John's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

While I'm accepting Bob's offer, I will try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round, just in case Bob is willing to budge further."
