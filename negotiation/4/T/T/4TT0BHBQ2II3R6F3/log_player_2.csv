"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can do better than $1,100,000.  Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000 for this product. I believe that's a fair price considering your value for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, Bob can still do better. He's willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  However, I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,000,000?  This is a fair price considering your value for the product, and it would allow me to save some money.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to save some money, but $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'll counter with $1,050,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has made a final offer of $1,050,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what he's willing to pay from John ($1,200,000) and still allows him to save some money.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a lower price, and there's a risk of Alice deciding to sell to someone else.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the best decision to ensure getting the product at a good price."
