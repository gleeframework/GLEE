"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you considering my needs. However, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $160 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's split the difference. How about $140?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $150, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",150.0,Alice,5,
