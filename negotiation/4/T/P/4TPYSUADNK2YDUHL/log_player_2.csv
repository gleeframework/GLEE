**Reasoning:** 

At this point, it seems unlikely Alice will go as low as a price that would make it worth continuing the negotiation.  

* **Alice's bottom line:**  She likely won't go much lower than $14,500.
* **Your best alternative:** You can buy the product for $10,000 from John. 

The potential savings of a few hundred dollars by haggling further with Alice aren't worth the risk of her not budging and you ending up with a worse deal."
