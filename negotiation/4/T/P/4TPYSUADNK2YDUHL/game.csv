"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $18,000 for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $14,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $14,500 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's the best we can do. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
