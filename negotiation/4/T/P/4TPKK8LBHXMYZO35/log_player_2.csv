"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to part with it for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent discount from John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal. He has room to negotiate, as the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offering process and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $925,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to go down to $925,000, but Bob can likely still get a better price.  He's already offered $850,000 and knows that Alice is motivated to sell, as she values the product at $800,000. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price closer to his desired range."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'll offer it to you for $912,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm at $912,500, which is still a decent price considering her value of $800,000 and John's price of $1,200,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
