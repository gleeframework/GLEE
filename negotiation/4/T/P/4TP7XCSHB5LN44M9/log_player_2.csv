"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting price is way too high. It's even more than the product's worth to you ($12,000 vs. $8,000). It's time to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. Would you consider $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my maximum budget ($6,000 vs. $8,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This low offer will help me understand how flexible Alice is on price. If she's willing to come down this much, it indicates she's motivated to sell. If not, I can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, which is good, but $9,000 is still above my maximum budget. I need to push her a bit further down.  I'll try to meet her somewhere in the middle again to show I'm willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Again):**  This keeps a collaborative tone while showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Below My Limit:**  $7,500 is a significant saving and still leaves me some wiggle room below my $8,000 maximum.
* **Testing Alice's Bottom Line:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how low Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice doesn't seem willing to budge below $9,000. Her latest offer of $9,500 reinforces this.  I've tried negotiating, but it's clear I won't get a price I'm comfortable with from Alice. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer of $8,000.  While I might have been able to get the price down a little more with Alice, it's not worth the risk of her walking away and me ending up with nothing."
