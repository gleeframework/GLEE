"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,5,
