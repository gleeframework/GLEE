"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $100? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $100 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's split the difference and go with $90. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $110. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",105.0,Alice,5,
