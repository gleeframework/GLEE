"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. I can save more money by negotiating further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm happy to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer to $1,100,000, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $950,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal just yet. I'll meet you at $1050000, and that's my final offer. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is within my acceptable range. While I would prefer to pay $1,000,000,  I risk losing the deal if I reject this offer and potentially have to buy from John at $1,500,000.  It's a good compromise and allows me to save a significant amount compared to John's price."
