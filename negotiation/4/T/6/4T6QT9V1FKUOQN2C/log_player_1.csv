Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $140. I'll counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer of $130.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about making a deal, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
