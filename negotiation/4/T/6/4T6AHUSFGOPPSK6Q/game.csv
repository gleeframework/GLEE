"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I need the price to be more realistic. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but there's still a gap between our expectations. To be candid, I'm considering other options closer to $750,000. If you're able to meet me around there, I'm ready to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your candor and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $750,000 is really the absolute floor for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Alice,5,
