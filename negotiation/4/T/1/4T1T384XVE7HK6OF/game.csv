"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $12,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my price.",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $10,000, which is the lowest I can go. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,,
