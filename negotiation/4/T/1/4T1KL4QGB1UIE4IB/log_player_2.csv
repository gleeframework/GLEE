"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget.  There's no incentive to negotiate further. You might be able to get a better price from Alice, but you're guaranteed to get the product for $120 from John.  Therefore, the most logical choice is to buy from John."
