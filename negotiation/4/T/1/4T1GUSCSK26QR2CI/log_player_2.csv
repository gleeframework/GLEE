Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $82.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $83.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I made a mistake, I already decided to reject the offer and consider buying from John. I should have chosen option 3 instead of making another counteroffer.

However, I'll make one more counteroffer to try to get a better deal. Here it is:
