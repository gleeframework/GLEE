,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal.",85.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $82.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $83.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",83.5,Alice,5,
