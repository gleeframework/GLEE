{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. I'm going to try to get closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $105 is still a decent profit and is only $5 less than my previous counteroffer. It's getting close to Bob's maximum, and further negotiation might risk losing the sale entirely."
