Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I understand its value and rarity, but I'm only willing to pay $1600000.  Let me know if you're open to that.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1800000, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1700000.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a happy middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1750000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,5,
