"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I also have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which acts as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you, considering what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be feasible?

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

However, I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
