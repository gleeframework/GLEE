"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $120 is better than John's $150, but you can likely do better.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's reasonably close to Alice's offer, but still significantly lower. 
* This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm about getting a better deal. 
* There's a good chance Alice will accept this price since it's still above her valuation of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her offer to $115, which is now only $5 above my counteroffer.
* I'm willing to pay $115, as it's still below my maximum budget of $150 and a better deal than John's offer. 
* Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it's not worth the potential risk of Alice rejecting my offer again and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price."
