Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering Bob a price that is slightly lower than what the product is worth to him. I'll offer him:

{""product_price"": $120}

This is a reasonable price that should be attractive to Bob, but not so low that I'm giving away the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a better price in the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than the original price I was thinking of. I'll offer:

{""product_price"": $115}

This should be a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
