"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $112.50? That way we both get a fair deal.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $118. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",118.0,Alice,5,
