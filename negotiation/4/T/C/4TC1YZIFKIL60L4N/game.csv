"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly special.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's unique nature.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still significant.  I'm willing to make another move and consider $950,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000 to try and close this gap.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but we're still quite a ways apart. I'm willing to make one more significant move to try and close this deal. If you're prepared to agree to $900,000, we have a deal. However, I need to be upfront â€“ this is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,7,
