Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that:

* **Balances your desire for a higher price** with the potential of a counteroffer from Bob. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation** while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Is polite and inviting** to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $90 for it. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and Bob seems genuinely interested. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids further negotiation that could risk losing the deal altogether."
