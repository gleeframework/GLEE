Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price point for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that figure is strategic.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:** Offering $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to haggle, but still secures a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently price higher with Bob."
