This is a fair starting point considering the potential value. Let's discuss and see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is quite a bit below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated for the true value.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1025000? This would give us both a fair deal and allows us to move forward. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
