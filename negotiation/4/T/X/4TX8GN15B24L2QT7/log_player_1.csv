"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This initial offer is a strong opening position and allows room for negotiation.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net throughout the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than John's offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,200,000. This is a more reasonable compromise, still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but demonstrating flexibility.  I'm hoping this price point will incentivize Bob to negotiate further while still ensuring a healthy profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer, keeping John's offer in mind as my safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us, while still maintaining a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good outcome considering the possibility of going further down with Bob or selling to John for the same price.  It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
