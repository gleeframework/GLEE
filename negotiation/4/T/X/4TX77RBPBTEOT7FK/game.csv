"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know you'll recognize its value. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the product's current market value.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're making progress.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,250,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, but I value the potential of this partnership.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to a deal, but $1,250,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can come to an agreement.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to reconsider my options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
