"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know you'll recognize its value. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High (Anchoring):**  Opening with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above Bob's $800,000 valuation. 
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's high value, making the initial high price seem less outrageous.
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This first offer is primarily about gathering information about Bob's willingness to negotiate and his potential price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the product's current market value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer was entirely expected. He opened at his maximum perceived value. We need to negotiate him up significantly. Selling to John right now would mean leaving a potential $200,000 on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Stay Firm:** We're making a significant concession of $200,000 to show willingness to negotiate, but we are still well above Bob's initial offer.
* **Highlight Value:** We're reiterating the product's unique value proposition to justify the high price.
* **Urgency (Subtle):** Mentioning a ""mutually agreeable solution"" subtly hints at the limited negotiation window.

We'll assess Bob's next move to determine our strategy in the following rounds. If he makes small concessions, we'll likely have to concede a bit more aggressively. However, if he jumps significantly, we'll know there's room for a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now showing movement, which is a good sign. His increase to $950,000 suggests there's room for negotiation. While selling to John would net us an extra $50,000 right now, there's still a potential $50,000+ we could gain by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're making progress.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,250,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, but I value the potential of this partnership."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down by $150,000, a substantial amount that shows flexibility and a willingness to close the deal.
* **Framing as Compromise:** We emphasize that this price is a concession on our part, reinforcing the value of the product.
* **Building Rapport:** Mentioning a ""partnership"" fosters a sense of collaboration, potentially making Bob more receptive. 

We're getting closer to a potential agreement, but it's crucial to maintain a balance between concessions and holding firm to a price that reflects the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to a deal, but $1,250,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can come to an agreement.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to reconsider my options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our walk-away price of $1,000,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or selling to John, as we won't get a better outcome. Accepting this offer secures us the maximum achievable profit."
