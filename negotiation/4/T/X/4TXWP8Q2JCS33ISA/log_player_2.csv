"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation fails."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential value of your product, $15,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, but I won't go any higher. Let me know if you're interested in discussing that."", ""product_price"": 8000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still above my budget, but closer to my maximum.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a lower price before buying from John."
