Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'll offer it to him for $120. This is a reasonable price, considering it's still higher than its value to him, but not too high that he would immediately reject it.

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $100. Since this is lower than the value I place on the product, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price of $150. Let's try $130.
