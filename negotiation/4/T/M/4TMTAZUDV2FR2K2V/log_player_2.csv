"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. Alice is starting high, knowing you have an alternative but also wanting to maximize her profit. By rejecting her offer, you force her to potentially reconsider and offer a lower price."
