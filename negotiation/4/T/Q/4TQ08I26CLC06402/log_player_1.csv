{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, allowing for a potential middle ground.
* **John's Offer:**  It's important to remember that I have a backup offer from John, which keeps me from being overly desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Accepting his offer would mean losing a substantial amount of money compared to selling to John.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and can potentially push for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,075,000? This would be a fair compromise and still allow you to get a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  By being willing to negotiate, I demonstrate a commitment to finding a solution while maintaining a strong bargaining position. 
* **Appeal to Reason:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" can make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $1,062,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing a significant amount of money. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain control in the negotiation and can potentially push for a higher price. There's still room for Bob to move closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,062,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be at least $1,150,000.

Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise further but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the fact that I'm already making concessions.
* **Clarity:** I'm being clear and direct in my counteroffer, making it easy for Bob to understand my position.
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider this offer and let me know if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer is Significantly Better:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a much higher profit. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely require more time and effort, and the outcome is uncertain.  

**Conclusion:**  It's in my best interest to take John's offer and sell the product for $1,500,000."
