"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both your $10,000 limit and John's offer of $10,000. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer."
