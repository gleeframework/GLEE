Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,500,000) and higher than what it's worth to Bob ($1,200,000). This is a bold opening move, aiming to secure a higher price. I'm also aware that I have a safety net with John's offer, so I can afford to be slightly aggressive.  

It's likely Bob will reject this offer, giving me the opportunity to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. 

John's offer provides a solid fallback option, but I'm confident I can push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while still maintaining a strong position. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value while still leaving room for negotiation. 

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise, potentially pushing Bob to reconsider his position and potentially make a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to that figure, there is a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away. 

At this point, it's more advantageous to secure a sale with Bob.  This is a good outcome considering I was initially aiming for a price significantly higher than $1,450,000."
