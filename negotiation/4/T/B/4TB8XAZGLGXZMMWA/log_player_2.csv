"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $15000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is selling the product for $14,000.
* **John's Offer:**  John is selling the product for $15,000.

Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product for $1,000 less than he would pay John. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate with Alice further, the offer is already within his budget and saves him money compared to the alternative."
