Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident that the product is worth at least this much to me, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept anything below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,750. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer of $10,000, but still above Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm on getting a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,450. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,450
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, but $9,450 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,600. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still below my initial asking price. I'm trying to find a middle ground where we can both be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and it's clear that he's not going to go much higher.  I'm not willing to go lower than $9,000, and it doesn't seem like he's willing to go that high.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum value, and it guarantees a sale."
