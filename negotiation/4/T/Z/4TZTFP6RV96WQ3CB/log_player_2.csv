"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards my $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me right now.  I could do $6,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim low, but not insultingly low:** Starting at $6,500 gives us room to negotiate upwards while still being significantly under Alice's initial ask and closer to my target price.
* **Polite and open to negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate you're interested, $6,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need to be closer to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some wiggle room. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved a bit, $9,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to go a little higher, but I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if needed.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a significant jump from my last offer, and shows I'm serious about buying."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference (almost):** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still staying under my $8,000 limit. 
* **Highlighting the movement:** Emphasizing the increase from my previous offer might make Alice more receptive. 
* **Expressing seriousness:**  The tone aims to show Alice that I'm motivated to close the deal, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'd be happy to accept $8,500. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and leaves room for a fair deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm above my $8,000 limit. While she might be willing to go a tiny bit lower, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. I can get the product for my target price from John with no more hassle."
