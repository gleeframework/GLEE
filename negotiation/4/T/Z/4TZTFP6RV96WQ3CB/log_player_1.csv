Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive and friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Reasoning:** Providing a brief justification for the price helps make the offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me right now.  I could do $6,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even lower than the product's value to him ($8,000). 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I have John willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage during the negotiation with Bob.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate you're interested, $6,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need to be closer to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some wiggle room. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product's worth to him.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** The message remains friendly to keep the negotiation positive and encouraging. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  The message implies I might be open to further compromise, but only within a reasonable range.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation going while pushing for a price closer to my desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a significant jump from my last offer, and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $7,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:** Although Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, I'm not convinced he's willing to go much higher.  There's still potential to get closer to my target price. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer for $12,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer, showing my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm highlighting that $8,500 is a fair price considering the product's worth to Bob.
