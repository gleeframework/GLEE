"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal for you, considering the value it provides. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $100 right now.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $125. I'm still a bit tight on budget though. How about $110?  It's a good middle ground and lets us both get a good deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50.  This would be a win-win for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $117.50 is still a bit out of my range. I'm ready to go to $115. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",115.0,Bob,6,
