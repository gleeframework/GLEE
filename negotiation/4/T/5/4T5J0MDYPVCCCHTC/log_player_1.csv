{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so he has room to negotiate upward. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you some room to lower the price if necessary, while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** Bob knows exactly what you're offering and what you expect. 

By starting at $1,000,000, you create an opportunity for a successful negotiation while also protecting your minimum value. You can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response, and you have the option to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $920,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $920,000 is a decent offer, it's still below the $950,000 counteroffer you made. There's still room to negotiate with Bob and see if you can get closer to your desired price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can reach an agreement. Selling to John is always an option, but you might be able to get a better price with Bob if you keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $930,000. This is a final offer, as I'm already significantly below my ideal price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this compromise."", ""product_price"": 930000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but no higher. Can you accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $920,000 is a decent price, it's still below the $930,000 counteroffer you made. Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a higher price, and you've already made several compromises.  

Since John is offering your desired price of $1,200,000, selling to John is the best choice to maximize your profit."
