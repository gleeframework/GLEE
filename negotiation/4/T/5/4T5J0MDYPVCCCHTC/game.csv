"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go above $920,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $930,000. This is a final offer, as I'm already significantly below my ideal price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this compromise.",930000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but no higher. Can you accept this price?",920000.0,Bob,6,
