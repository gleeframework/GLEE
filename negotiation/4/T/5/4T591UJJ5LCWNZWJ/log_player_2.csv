}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value but still leaves me some room for negotiation."

Alice is coming down, but I think I can still get a better price. I'll reject and counter."

{
""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $107?"",
