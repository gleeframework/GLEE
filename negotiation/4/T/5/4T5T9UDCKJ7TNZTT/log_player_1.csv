Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without losing him to John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $135 creates a win-win situation. Bob saves $15 compared to his perceived value, and Alice earns a $15 profit compared to selling to John. 

This approach balances profit maximization with a high likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
