Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Above Minimum:** The price is well above your minimum acceptable price ($120), ensuring a profit.

By starting with a strong but potentially negotiable offer, you increase your chances of securing a higher sale price from Bob."
