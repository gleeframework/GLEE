"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with a fair transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
