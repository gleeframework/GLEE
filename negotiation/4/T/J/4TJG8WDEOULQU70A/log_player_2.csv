Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

Let's start with a significant discount.  $900,000 is a good starting point for our counteroffer.  We're still within our budget, but it's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where we're very close to our budget and Alice is unlikely to budge much further. It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John for $800,000.  It's a better deal for us than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
