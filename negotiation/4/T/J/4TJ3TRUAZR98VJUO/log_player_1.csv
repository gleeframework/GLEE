Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable to your business.  My initial asking price is $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum of my own value for the product. I believe I can negotiate a better price.  I'm also still interested in exploring the potential of a higher price with Bob.  Selling to John is an option, but I'd prefer to see if I can secure a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  The product is worth significantly more than $1,200,000, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This reflects a fair compromise while still allowing me to receive a reasonable price for the product. I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to see some movement from your side as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. $1,250,000 is only slightly more than John's offer, and I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'm committed to trying to secure the best possible outcome for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see your point about wanting a fair price, but I still believe this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,275,000, a compromise that reflects the product's worth and acknowledges your perspective. This feels like a reasonable starting point for us to find a final agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to see some more movement from your side as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're reaching a critical point in the negotiation. Bob's offer is now only $25,000 above John's offer.  Given the limited number of rounds remaining, I'm not confident that I can secure a significantly higher price with Bob.  To avoid risking losing out entirely, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
