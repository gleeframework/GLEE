I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not convinced we'll reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
