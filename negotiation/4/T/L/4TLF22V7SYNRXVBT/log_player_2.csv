"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair price to me."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: $825,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
At this point, Alice has drawn a line in the sand and is unlikely to go much lower.  It's in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000 rather than risk Alice sticking to her ""final offer"" or potentially moving even further away from a mutually agreeable price.
