{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation but still below my minimum. This allows for room to negotiate and hopefully strike a deal that's beneficial for both of us.  I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm still trying to get a price closer to my desired $120, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to secure a sale. $110 is a reasonable compromise that hopefully Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108. Let's split the difference and make this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $109.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 109}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. $109 is a fair compromise that hopefully will convince Bob to accept."
