Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very useful. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $120 to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, $95 is a reasonable compromise and significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale entirely, and John is always a safe option. However, since Bob is actively negotiating and showing interest, I'll accept this offer and secure the sale."
