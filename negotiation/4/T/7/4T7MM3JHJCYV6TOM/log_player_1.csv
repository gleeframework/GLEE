Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. This means any price above that is likely a dealbreaker.
* **The Unknown:** Bob's willingness to pay up to his valuation is unknown. He might hope for a deal and be willing to pay close to $800,000, or he might be a tough negotiator.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a bit bolder with Bob. Aim high, but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a (small) deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to acquire a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  The message starts by emphasizing the product's value.
* **Strategic Price:** $875,000 is a significant markup from your minimum, but it's not so high that it's immediately insulting to Bob.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're framing it as a ""fair reflection"" of the product's worth.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a great deal at $75,000 above your minimum!
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter with a lower offer. You can decide if you want to negotiate further or stick closer to your initial price.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You haven't lost anything. You sell to John for your guaranteed $800,000. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. You could try a lower starting price to increase the chances of a quick sale, but you'd be leaving potential profit on the table."
