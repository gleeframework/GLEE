"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($120)** is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from Alice is cheaper** than buying from John ($150). 
* **Even though you can save more money by rejecting the offer and bargaining with Alice further, the prompt specifically asks for a decision to buy the product, not to negotiate. **

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this scenario."
