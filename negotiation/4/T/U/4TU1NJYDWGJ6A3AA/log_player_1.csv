Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to maximize my potential profit. I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so I have room to negotiate.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth pursuing further or if it's better to simply sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair price and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  Even though I want to maximize my profit, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000. This ensures I get a fair price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially ending with an even lower offer."
