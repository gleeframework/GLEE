"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice's offer of $110 is still above your target.
* **Negotiation potential:** You have 10 rounds, giving you ample time to try and negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  You can always buy from John for $120, but you'd rather save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $95 is a bit too low for me. Could we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While Alice has come down from $110, $105 is still above your target of $120.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** You have several rounds left and Alice is showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **John is a safe option:**  You can always buy from John for $120, but you're hoping to get a better deal with Alice."
