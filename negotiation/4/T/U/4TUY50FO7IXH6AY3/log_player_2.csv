"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  Alice is starting high, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer. Starting with a counteroffer of $90 gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Positive:** Even though we're countering significantly, maintaining a friendly and interested tone encourages continued negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer establishes a lower anchor point for the bargaining process, potentially leading Alice to suggest a price closer to our desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice met us halfway, which is a good sign that further negotiation is possible. We're getting closer to a price we're happy with, but we can still try to save a bit more.  We'll counter with a price closer to $100, which is still a reasonable profit for Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $98?  That feels like a fair price to me."", 
""product_price"": 98
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments to signal we're reaching our limit. 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  $98 is a good compromise, giving Alice a decent profit while saving us $7 compared to her last offer.
* **Justification:** By saying ""$98 feels fair,"" we're subtly anchoring our suggestion to a sense of fairness, which might make Alice more agreeable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $102. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice is down to $102, which is only $2 more than our target price. It's unlikely we'll get her much lower.
* **Saving Money:**  We're still saving $18 compared to John's price.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  If we push further, Alice might end the negotiation. We risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
