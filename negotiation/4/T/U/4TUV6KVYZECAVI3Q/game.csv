"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $95.  This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $100.  If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
