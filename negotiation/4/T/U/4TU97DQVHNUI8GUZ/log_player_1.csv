Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your ideal outcome. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay, it's still below what the product is worth to you. There's potential to negotiate a higher price. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're looking for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  Considering the true value of this product, I could come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer significantly lowers the price from your initial ask but still keeps you well above both Bob's offer and John's offer. It suggests willingness to negotiate while aiming for a strong profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""true value,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth and why your price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open to further discussion, allowing Bob to counter again if he's seriously interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether. He's clearly interested but also price-sensitive. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While you could hold out for more, there's always a chance the negotiations could drag on, and you might miss out on other opportunities. Accepting now secures a good profit."
