"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  How about $12,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,500. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is better than $15,000, Bob is still hoping to get a better deal. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, as he believes he can still get a price closer to his ideal range of $12,500."
