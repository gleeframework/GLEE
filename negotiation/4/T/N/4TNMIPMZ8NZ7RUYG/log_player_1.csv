Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This gives you room to make concessions if needed.

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $120, so I won't be afraid to walk away if the negotiation isn't productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit to $95,  which is right in the middle of our positions.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to earn a decent profit. This offer is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the farm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is too low for me. It's below my minimum price and I don't think there's much room for further negotiation.  It's better for me to sell to John for $120 and avoid the hassle of further negotiations."
