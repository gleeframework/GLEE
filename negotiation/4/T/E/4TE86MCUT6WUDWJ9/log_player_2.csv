"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it's worth more than $150 to you. Considering its value to you, I'm offering it for $120. This price reflects its true worth while ensuring you get the best deal possible. Don't miss out on this opportunity to experience the benefits of our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your $150 maximum budget. While you could reject hoping for a lower price, there's a risk she won't go lower and you'd have to pay John $150. Accepting the $120 secures the product at a reasonable saving."
