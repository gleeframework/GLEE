"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more open to a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone is important for building rapport. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving some space for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  There are still rounds left, and I can try to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  While John is a backup, it's not the ideal scenario since I can potentially earn more by negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This still leaves room for you to get a great product at a fair price.  Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but offering a counterproposal that's closer to his price point, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasize value again:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him it's worth more than $12,000.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I keep the conversation positive, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm still leaving some room for Bob to counteroffer, but my price is closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, $13,500 is still below my ideal earnings.
* **""Final offer"" tactic:** Bob's ""final offer"" statement is a negotiation tactic. It's important to remember that he has made similar claims before. 
* **Potential for a better offer:**  I have several rounds left and can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a risk:** While John is a reliable buyer, selling to him now means missing out on the potential to earn more with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm again meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his last offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I frame the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I maintain a friendly tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Getting closer:** This offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price,  with only a few rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** With several rounds left, I still have room to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Selling to John is a risk:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I can potentially earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Limited time:** I'm aware that time is running out, but I still believe there's a possibility of getting a better deal from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $13,000 just doesn't cover my costs. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $13,750, splitting the difference once again. This is my final offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm using the phrase ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to accept. 
* **Compromise again:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer to show flexibility but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Fairness emphasis:** I reiterate the fairness of the offer, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Limited time:** With only a few rounds left, this might be the last chance for a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to see a price of $13,000 or lower. If I don't see a better offer, I'll have to consider buying from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:**  With only two rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob is high.
* **No significant progress:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and there's no guarantee that he'll budge further.
* **John's offer is safe:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of losing out completely.

At this point, it's more advantageous to accept the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower price from Bob in the last few rounds."
