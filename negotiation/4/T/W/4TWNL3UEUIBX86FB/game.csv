"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This still leaves room for you to get a great product at a fair price.  Let's see if we can find common ground!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $13,000 just doesn't cover my costs. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $13,750, splitting the difference once again. This is my final offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to see a price of $13,000 or lower. If I don't see a better offer, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",13000.0,Bob,8,
