"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This gives you a chance to acquire something truly beneficial at a price that's still favorable. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it at $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
