"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to me. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the potential benefits of the product to Bob to increase his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message is open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product for a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is right at my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of him walking away or me not getting a better offer in the following rounds is high.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and guaranteed sale."
