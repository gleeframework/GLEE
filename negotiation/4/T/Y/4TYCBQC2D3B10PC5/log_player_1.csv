Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet that price. 
* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start high in a negotiation. This leaves room for you to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob pushes back, while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Direct and Polite:** The message is clear and to the point, while maintaining a professional and friendly tone."
