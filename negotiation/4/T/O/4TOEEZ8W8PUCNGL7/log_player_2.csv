"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my minimum asking price but still gives you a solid profit margin.  Let me know what you think!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This is my final offer, let me know what you think.
