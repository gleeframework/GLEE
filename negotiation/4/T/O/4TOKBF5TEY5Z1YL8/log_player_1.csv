Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations with Bob at a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then gradually decrease the price, aiming to settle somewhere above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** The message vaguely hints at the product's value, which might make Bob more inclined to consider the offer even if it's initially higher than he'd prefer.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. Your goal is to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
