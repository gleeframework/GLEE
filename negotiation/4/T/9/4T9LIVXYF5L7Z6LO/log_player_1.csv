"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is lower than its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

At this point, Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer. There's no further benefit to potentially risky negotiation with Bob. Accepting John's offer ensures Alice gets her minimum acceptable price."
