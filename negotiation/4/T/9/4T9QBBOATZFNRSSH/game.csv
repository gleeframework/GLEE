"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm firm on $1,000,000.  This price is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to accept $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
