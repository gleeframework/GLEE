"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it will be even more valuable to you. My starting price is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's significantly above my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and I have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation. My goal is to get as close to my ideal price as possible, while still leaving space for potential concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm firm on $1,000,000.  This price is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still outside my budget.  I'm not willing to buy the product from Alice at that price yet.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a smaller jump than my previous one, showing Alice I'm serious about getting a deal.  $950,000 is closer to my ideal price while still allowing for further negotiation, potentially finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to accept $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is within my budget and represents a good deal for me. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that the price will not drop much further. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the potential of losing the product to another seller."
