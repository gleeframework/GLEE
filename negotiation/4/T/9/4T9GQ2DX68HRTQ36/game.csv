"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $820,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $820,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. That's a substantial sum and demonstrates my serious interest in this product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
