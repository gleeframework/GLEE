"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,100,000. He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay up to $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to keep his counteroffer within a range that feels reasonable to both parties.  He's starting at $1,050,000, which is halfway between Alice's offer and his own maximum. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate. It leaves room for further concessions without immediately going too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product has tremendous value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm willing to make a compromise to get the deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good deal for Bob. He's willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so this price saves him a significant amount. 
* **No Need to Risk It:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it could also risk losing the deal altogether."
