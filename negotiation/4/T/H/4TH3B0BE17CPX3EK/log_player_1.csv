Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.

You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think we can meet at a lower price. I'd like to offer $1,700,000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, Bob's final offer of $1,700,000 is significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) and risking further negotiation might lead to him walking away. It's a good deal at this point."
