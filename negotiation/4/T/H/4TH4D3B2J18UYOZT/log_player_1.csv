"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the value of the product to Bob, hoping to influence his decision. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for discussion, which encourages Bob to respond with a counteroffer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider lowering the price slightly, but always keeping in mind the value of the product to me and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I can only afford to pay up to $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Time:**  While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I have time and rounds left to negotiate.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob has already shown interest and is willing to negotiate. There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price in future rounds.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees my minimum value, but it eliminates the potential for a higher profit from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price between $950,000 and my desired $1,000,000, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you.  Let's make this happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my desired price ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value, but also showing flexibility.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the importance of closing the deal and suggesting it's a good opportunity for both of us.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer again, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next round. My priority is to secure the minimum value, and I don't want to waste too many rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on my budget, I am comfortable with a price of $975000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 away from my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in round 4, and I'm aware that I have limited rounds to close a deal.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though this deal is slightly below my ideal price, it's still a significant profit.  Additionally, there's always the possibility of future deals with Bob where I might achieve a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

While I'm accepting this offer, I'll keep in mind the potential for future negotiations with Bob.  I'll also be mindful of the value of the product to me and the time remaining in the negotiation."
