I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This is significantly higher than my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm hoping that he values the product highly enough to be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'd rather see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $17,500.  This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's still below my initial asking price.  I'm hoping this shows some flexibility while still getting a decent price."

```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached a point where the negotiation is taking time and I'm not sure it will lead to a higher offer from Bob.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John and move on."
