"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm able to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price for a product of this quality.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is still below my minimum selling price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
