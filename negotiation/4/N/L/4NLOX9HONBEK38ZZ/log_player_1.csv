Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Above John's Offer:** The offer significantly surpasses John's $1,200,000, ensuring you're not settling for less.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay. If you had more insights into Bob's personality, you could adjust your approach accordingly."
