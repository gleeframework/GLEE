Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm still interested in purchasing it, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
