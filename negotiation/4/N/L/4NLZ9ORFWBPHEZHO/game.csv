"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true market value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile. Let's try $1,125,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, given the value of the product and the time we've invested in negotiating. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
