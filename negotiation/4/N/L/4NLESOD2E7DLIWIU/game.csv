"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm offering it at $22,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise. This allows you a decent profit, while staying within my budget.  Let's work towards a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
