"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm offering it at $22,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high. It's far above my maximum budget of $10,000.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still too high for my budget.  While it's closer than her initial offer, I'm determined to get it closer to my maximum of $10,000.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise. This allows you a decent profit, while staying within my budget.  Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
