"I appreciate your offer, Alice.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm genuinely interested in this product.  While $1,050,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,035,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come away satisfied.",1035000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I've already met you at $1,050,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to throw in a small concession, though - I'll give you a 1% discount, making the price $1,045,000.
