Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $15,000**, as this is the value of the product to me.
* **Bob values the product at $10,000**, so I need to offer him a price between these two values.
* **Offering $12,000** allows me to make a profit while still being competitive with John's potential offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also giving Bob a reasonable price that might encourage him to accept."
