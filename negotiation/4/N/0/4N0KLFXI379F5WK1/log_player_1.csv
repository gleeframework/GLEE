{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a significant profit.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction and adjusting my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and hopefully signals my willingness to negotiate, but it still provides me with a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $1,250,000 is a good price, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to go higher. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a sale and a significant profit. It's also worth noting that continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
