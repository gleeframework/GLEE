{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, increasing Bob's potential interest. 

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:** This gives you room to negotiate downward if necessary.
* **Be flexible:** I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob, but also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000. 
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the product's worth might encourage Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum.  
* **Reasoning:** I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. 
* **Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming to bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $13,500, which is a compromise that moves closer to Bob's offer while still keeping my profit margin.
