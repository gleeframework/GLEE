I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand his budget constraints, $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I still believe the product has significant value to him, and I'm confident we can find a more agreeable price."

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a fair compromise and a good outcome for me.  It's above my minimum, and  it's a better deal than selling to John."
