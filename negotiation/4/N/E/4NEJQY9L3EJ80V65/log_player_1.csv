{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,450,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision as soon as possible."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially higher profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, the offer needs to be enticing while still profitable for me.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the deal seriously.

This strategy balances securing a deal with maximizing the potential profit from Bob before accepting John's guaranteed offer."
