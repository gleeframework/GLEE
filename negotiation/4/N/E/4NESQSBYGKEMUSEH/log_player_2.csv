"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $800,000. This is a great opportunity to get an exclusive product at a discounted rate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $800,000 is a good discount, there's room for negotiation. It's better to see if Alice is willing to go lower before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get the product for closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $800,000. This price is within Bob's budget and saves him $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While there might be room for further negotiation, accepting this offer minimizes risk and secures the product at a good price."
