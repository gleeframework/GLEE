Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I'm pleased to inform you that I'm willing to meet you halfway. I am now offering the product to you for $12,750. This price reflects the value of the product while aiming for a fair compromise between our positions.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has successfully negotiated a price lower than John's offer. While a counteroffer could potentially lead to a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to negotiate or even walk away entirely. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob a purchase at a price that's favorable to him and saves him a considerable amount compared to John's offer."
