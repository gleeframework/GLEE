"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000, which I think is a fair and competitive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the product's worth to you. You have a better chance of getting a lower price by rejecting and counter-offering.  It's worth trying to negotiate before resorting to John's $1,000,000 offer."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm confident that the product's value will be well worth the investment for you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is still above the product's value to you, but it's getting closer to your target.  Rejecting and counter-offering again gives you a chance to try and get closer to your ideal price. You still have room to negotiate before having to resort to John's $1,000,000 offer."
