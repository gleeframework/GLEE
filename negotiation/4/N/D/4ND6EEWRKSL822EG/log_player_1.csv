I'll reject Bob's offer.  $1,650,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm getting closer to my desired price, but $1,675,000 is still not acceptable. I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. Considering the value and my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $1680000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,680,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, $1,680,000 is close enough to my desired range and it's likely we won't get a better offer from Bob.  It's also better than selling to John for $1,200,000."
