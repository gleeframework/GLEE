"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I already have a guaranteed buyer at a lower price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your previous offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I'd like to propose a slight discount. How about we meet at $975,000, and you throw in some additional value, such as a warranty or support package, to sweeten the deal?",975000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate the suggestion of additional value, but frankly, the product speaks for itself. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant concession, and I need a decision soon as my other offer is still on the table.",1025000.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand that you're trying to move the deal forward, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but I need some assurance that this is the final offer. Can you confirm that $990,000 is the lowest price you're willing to accept?",990000.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, you're right, we need to wrap this up soon. I'm confident this product is worth every penny of my initial asking price.  However, I'm willing to agree to $1,000,000, but this is absolutely my final offer.  Take it or leave it.",1000000.0,Alice,7,,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I need to be confident that I'm getting a good deal. Can you explain to me why this product is worth the premium price you're asking?",980000.0,Bob,8,,
