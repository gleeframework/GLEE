"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,700,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high price ($1,700,000) sets a strong anchor and leaves room for negotiation. Even though it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it gives us space to come down while still aiming for a price well above our minimum.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, framing the offer positively even with the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone encourages Bob's input and implies a willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how motivated he is and how much he values the product.
2. **Establish a High Starting Point:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it sets a benchmark for future negotiations. 

Remember, we have John as a backup, so we can afford to be assertive in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, we're aiming to earn as much as possible. Accepting immediately leaves potential profit on the table. We have room to negotiate, especially since we have John as a reliable backup at our desired minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise, recognizing its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** We've made a substantial drop from $1,700,000 to $1,500,000, demonstrating flexibility but also indicating we're serious about a higher price point.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We're continuing to emphasize the product's worth to justify the higher price, subtly countering Bob's ""market value"" argument.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to view this as a win-win negotiation rather than a battle.

We're still significantly above Bob's offer and our minimum, but this counteroffer aims to:

1. **Test Bob's Flexibility:** His response will reveal how willing he is to move from his initial offer.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:**  We're not dropping to his level immediately, showcasing our product's value and our own negotiation strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob significantly lowered his offer, indicating potential willingness to move further up. Accepting $1,000,000 would be a considerable loss, especially with John as a guaranteed backup at our minimum price. We still have negotiating power and time to leverage it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $1,350,000? This reflects the value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've come down by another $150,000, showing movement but remaining firm above Bob's offer.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with an upward movement.
* **Holding Ground:**  While we're making concessions, we're still significantly above his $1,000,000 offer, signaling that we're aiming for a price closer to our initial range.

This offer seeks to:

1. **Encourage Bob Upwards:** The substantial drop from our previous offer may motivate him to increase his significantly.
2. **Maintain Profit Margin:**  We're still targeting a price that provides a substantial profit, even if it's not our ideal.
3. **Avoid Stalemate:**  Consistently rejecting his offers without showing flexibility could lead to a deadlock."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a good fit for me. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob significantly decreased his offer again, signaling he might not be willing to meet near our desired price range. This, combined with his ""as low as I can go"" statement, suggests further negotiation might be fruitless and time-consuming. 

We have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000, which is our minimum acceptable price. It makes more sense to cut our losses now and secure a guaranteed profit rather than risking a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate in the remaining rounds."
