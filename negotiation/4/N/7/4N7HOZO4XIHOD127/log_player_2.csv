"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a strong negotiating stance and signals that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  $4,000 is a significant discount from Alice's $5,000, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, Bob can still likely get a better deal. He's already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice's offer isn't significantly lower than his counteroffer. There's still room to get closer to his target price of $4,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. This counteroffer shows he's willing to compromise but still wants to save as much as possible.  It's a smaller increment than his previous offer, suggesting he's more serious about closing the deal.  This makes Alice more likely to accept, especially if she values closing the sale quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $4,400, which is only $200 higher than Bob's last counteroffer. While Bob could continue negotiating, he's close to his target price and has already invested several rounds. Accepting the offer at this point secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the deal falling apart."
