{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $14,000 is a good starting point because it's a significant profit for me, yet leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value for Bob. This increases the likelihood of a positive response.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a good price!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation.  If it's too low, I'll consider selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob. He's shown interest and is willing to pay more than my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my desired price point, but still leaves room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum.  This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlight Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its potential benefits.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting further dialogue.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Excellent!  I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll carefully consider Bob's counteroffer.  If it's close to my desired price, I might accept it. If not, I'll either make another counteroffer or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Price:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This represents a good profit for me.
* **No Room for Improvement:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Bob might walk away entirely.  His offer is already very close to my minimum, and there's no guarantee he'll be willing to go higher. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This ensures a successful transaction and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
