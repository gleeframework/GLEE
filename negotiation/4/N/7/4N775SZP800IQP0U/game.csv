"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I understand the value, but $12,500 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this transaction.",12000.0,Alice,5,
