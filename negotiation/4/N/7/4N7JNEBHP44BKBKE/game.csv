"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to secure a fair price. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can understand my position.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
