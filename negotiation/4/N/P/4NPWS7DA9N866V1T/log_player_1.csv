{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. It also leaves room for Bob to counter-offer.

**Why this approach:**

* **Maximizing profit:**  $950,000 is a strong starting point, allowing for potential negotiation up to my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Motivating Bob:** By leaving room for negotiation, I encourage Bob to engage and potentially increase his perceived value of the product.
* **Maintaining flexibility:** This approach allows me to quickly move on to John if Bob proves unwilling to negotiate or his counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, and I believe I have room to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Selling for $850,000 would be a substantial loss. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob's counteroffer suggests he sees value in the product. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push him closer to my desired price point.
* **John as a backup:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept an offer below my minimum.

**Next step:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $850,000 is below my minimum for this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This reflects the value we both see in the product and gives us a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $900,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find common ground. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for both of us.  It also highlights the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer.

**Why this approach:**

* **Bridging the gap:** By meeting Bob halfway, I show a willingness to compromise and make the negotiation more likely to succeed.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal.
* **Focusing on value:**  The message reinforces the product's worth and suggests a win-win scenario for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe we can still find common ground. I am willing to increase my offer to $875,000. I hope this proposal will be more agreeable and move us closer to a successful transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Selling for $875,000 would be a substantial loss.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob's increased offer suggests he's willing to negotiate further. By rejecting his offer, I can push for a price closer to my desired value.
* **John as a backup:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept an offer below my minimum.

**Next step:** I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while staying above my minimum price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum for this product.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the value we both see in the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $925,000, which is closer to my previous offer of $900,000 and slightly above Bob's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and highlights the value of the product for both of us. It emphasizes the potential for a win-win scenario, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer.

**Why this approach:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to meet Bob halfway while still remaining above my minimum price.
* **Staying firm:** $925,000 is still a significant amount of money, but it's closer to my desired value than Bob's offer.
* **Encouraging agreement:** The message emphasizes the potential for a successful deal, hopefully motivating Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to decide whether to make another offer or sell the product to John for $1,000,000.
* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I'll have successfully negotiated a price that is both beneficial to me and acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Alice. I am willing to meet you halfway at $890,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to come to a fair resolution. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $890,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still below the point where I'm comfortable making a deal. I've already made significant concessions and it seems clear that Bob is not willing to reach my desired price point. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. Selling for $890,000 would still be a significant loss.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Bob's last offer indicates he's unlikely to increase his offer much further.
* **John's guaranteed offer:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making him the better option.

**Why this decision:**

By selling to John, I ensure I get my minimum desired price, avoiding a loss and securing a profitable transaction. While I would have preferred to work with Bob, his unwillingness to come closer to my minimum value makes John the more sensible choice."
