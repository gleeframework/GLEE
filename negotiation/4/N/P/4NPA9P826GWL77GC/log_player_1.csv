Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your potential profit:** The starting price is high, but it leaves room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **Avoid unnecessary delays:** Offering a reasonable price initially increases the likelihood of a quick sale.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives you leverage if Bob rejects your offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  It's more advantageous to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming to get closer to my target price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate.
* **Increase potential profits:**  There's still room to push for a higher price.
* **Gain information:**  Bob's offer gives me insights into his maximum willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is still a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob while still expressing the need for a higher price.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and keep the negotiation moving. I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm showing flexibility.

**Reasoning:**

By offering $950,000, I'm:

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $950,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** This maintains the potential for a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $920,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While there's a possibility we could continue negotiating, the risk of further concessions outweighs the potential gain at this point.  It's more beneficial to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed sale at my desired price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer ensures I receive my minimum desired value for the product, providing financial security.
* **Minimized risk:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could result in further concessions and a lower final price.
* **Time efficiency:**  Selling to John avoids further rounds of negotiations and delays. 

**Conclusion:**

While Bob is willing to negotiate, the current offer falls below my acceptable threshold, and the risk of further concessions is not worth the potential gain. Accepting John's offer guarantees a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
