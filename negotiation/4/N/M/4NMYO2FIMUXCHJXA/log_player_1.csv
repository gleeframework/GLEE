Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position. Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of a deal for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is high enough to give you negotiation room if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Emphasizing value and exclusivity:**  The message aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a special opportunity, increasing the chances he'll accept the high price. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
