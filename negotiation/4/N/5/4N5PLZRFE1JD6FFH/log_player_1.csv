Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point given the product is worth $150 to Bob.  I want to maximize my profit, but I also want to be flexible to ensure a deal is reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's, in hopes of finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $110 is still a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. There's a chance I might not get a better offer from Bob, and selling to John would only give me $100. It's time to secure the sale."
