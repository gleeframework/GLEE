``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value to me subtly emphasizes its worth to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** I'm leaving a bit of wiggle room to accommodate potential counteroffers.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open for possible compromise."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for compromise:** I can still potentially increase the price with a counteroffer, as Bob has shown interest.
* **Exploring potential for a better deal:** Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to see if Bob is willing to go higher or if I can find a more profitable compromise.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  I can come down a bit, but $13,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to accept $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I frame the counteroffer as a starting point for further discussion, showing flexibility and encouraging a mutually agreeable outcome. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise while maintaining a firm stance on the minimum acceptable price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $13,500 is still below my $15,000 threshold.
* **Time is on my side:** I have several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly less than what John is offering.
* **Possibility of a better deal:** I can still try to push for a higher price, especially since Bob is showing continued interest.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings by holding out for a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm going to need to stay firm at $14,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $14,000. This shows a firm stance while acknowledging Bob's interest.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price point.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is still positive, aiming to keep the negotiation open and encourage a deal.

This strategy aims to:

* **Hold out for a higher price:**  I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Not risk losing John's offer:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I still have the option of selling to John.
* **Maintain leverage:** By staying firm, I'm not giving away too much ground, making me a more difficult negotiator to sway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  While Bob is inching closer, $13,750 is still below my $15,000 minimum.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, which gives me the security to hold out for a better price from Bob.
* **Time to Increase Pressure:** I have a few rounds left. It's time to see if I can push Bob further towards my target price or if he's truly unwilling to go higher.

By rejecting the offer and moving to another counteroffer, I aim to:

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:** I still have a chance to get closer to my desired price.
* **Test Bob's Limits:** This move will gauge how serious Bob is about buying the product.
* **Avoid a Loss:** If Bob is unwilling to budge, I can always sell to John and secure a better deal."

```

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the final two rounds.  I need to make a decisive decision. 
* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $13,900 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000, and I don't have enough time to keep negotiating.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John. There's no reason to risk losing that by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

By selling to John, I'm:

* **Securing the Best Deal:** I'm getting my desired price and ensuring a sale. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiations:** I'm saving time and energy by not engaging in further rounds of negotiation with Bob. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** I'm removing the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer or not meeting my price expectations."
