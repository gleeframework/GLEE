"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good portion of Bob's potential value while leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a strong starting point, but I'm ready to adjust if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident in my product's value and will continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a good return on the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and $1,250,000 is a good deal. I've already gone through several rounds, and the risk of losing more money by continuing to negotiate outweighs the potential gain of a few extra thousand dollars."
