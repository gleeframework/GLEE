Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at the discounted price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your absolute minimum allows for some back and forth if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Bob's Interest:**  Highlighting the product's benefits to Bob might make him more amenable to a price above his perceived value.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By mentioning a public listing, you create a subtle sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to decide quicker."
