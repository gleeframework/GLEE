"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that can bring you significant returns. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but still below the value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a deal close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I believe the price could be a bit lower. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good return on your investment. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's still above my minimum but offers some flexibility for negotiation. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential returns for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $950,000 is close to my minimum and still significantly above what John is offering. With limited rounds remaining, it's strategically wise to accept this offer and secure a deal."
