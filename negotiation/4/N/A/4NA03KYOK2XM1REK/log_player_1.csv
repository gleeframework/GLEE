"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $160.  I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. However, I am interested in purchasing the product for $140. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price ($150), I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing negotiations. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $155?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $145 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $145 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Considering the limited number of rounds remaining, it's not worth risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or the loss of the sale.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
