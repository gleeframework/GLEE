"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can't pay such a high price for the product. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Let me know if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've given this some thought and am willing to go up to $14,000 for the product. I hope this is within your range to make a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
