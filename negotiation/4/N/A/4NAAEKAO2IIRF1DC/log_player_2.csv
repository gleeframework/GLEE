"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $175 is well above your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $145 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you still have several rounds left. You can try to counteroffer with a price closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $145 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110. If you can meet me at that price, we can make a deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $130. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above your budget of $100. You have several rounds left and you can still try to negotiate a lower price. While buying from John for $100 is always an option, it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $130. How about we split the difference and I pay $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the sale."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $120, which would be $125. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above your budget of $100. While you could continue negotiating, you only have three rounds left.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get the price down to your target. To ensure you get the product within your budget, it's best to accept the offer from John for $100."
