"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $145 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $145 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110. If you can meet me at that price, we can make a deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $130. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $130. How about we split the difference and I pay $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the sale.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $120, which would be $125. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,7,
