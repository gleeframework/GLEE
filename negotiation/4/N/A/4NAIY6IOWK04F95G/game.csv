"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects the value this product holds for you. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value this product holds for you.  Let me know your decision.",775000.0,Alice,5,
