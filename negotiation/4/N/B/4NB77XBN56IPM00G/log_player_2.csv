"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can save $1,000 by buying from John. Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price above her own perceived value.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
