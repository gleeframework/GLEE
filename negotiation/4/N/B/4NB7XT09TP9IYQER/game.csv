"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay something closer to $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fairer reflection of its true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can offer $1,100,000. I think this offer is a fair compromise, considering the value it offers to my business.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us. To find that middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this price accurately reflects its value and avoids further negotiation rounds.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $1,600,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at $1,000,000. I'd much rather work with you, but I need that price to be closer to my other option. If you're able to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I respect your transparency. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it reflects my strong desire to do business with you.  Given the unique advantages my product offers over the alternative, I believe this is a fair and final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be realistic.  My budget is firm, and I can't justify going beyond $1,050,000. This isn't about playing games - it's simply about what makes financial sense for me. I'm ready to finalize the purchase right now at this price.  If we can't make this work, I'll need to move forward with my other option.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
