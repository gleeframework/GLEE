"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the return on investment you'll get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to signal that you're looking for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Realistic but Ambitious:** Starting at $9,000 is ambitious but still within a believable range. It gives us room to negotiate up while staying well below Alice's asking price and our $8,000 walk-away alternative. 
* **Signaling Interest:** By stating a specific price and showing a willingness to negotiate, we indicate genuine interest in the product, which might encourage Alice to engage further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  I'm confident you won't find this kind of value anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice came down a bit, $18,000 is still significantly higher than both our target price and our backup option with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move from her initial price suggests there's room for further negotiation. We need to show her we're serious about a much lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me. $18,000 is still a bit high for my current budget. I'm thinking something closer to $11,000 would be more realistic. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  We're increasing our offer, but only to $11,000. This demonstrates willingness to move but keeps us well below her current offer and our walk-away point.
* **Guaging Seriousness:** By countering with a price significantly lower than her last offer, we're testing her flexibility and seriousness about making a deal. 
* **Open Communication:**  The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Alice to respond and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $15,000? That's a significant price drop and reflects my willingness to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer, but not there yet:** $15,000 is getting closer to a price we might consider, but it's still above our walk-away point with John.
* **Leverage Time:** We still have some rounds left, and Alice seems motivated to sell. There's no need to rush to accept a price that's not ideal.  
* **Testing the Waters:** By continuing to reject, we'll see how low Alice is willing to go and if a price closer to our target is achievable."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to being able to make this work. How about $12,500? If we can agree on that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump:** We're increasing our offer again, this time to $12,500. This is a substantial move to show Alice we're serious about finding a compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""ready to close the deal today,"" we introduce a sense of urgency and potential loss for Alice if she rejects. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $12,500 is a strong offer that keeps us below our $15,000 limit while leaving room for a final, smaller concession if needed."
