# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and the unique benefits it offers, we estimate its true worth to be $1,500,000. Considering this, I am extending to you an exclusive offer to acquire this product at a special price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant saving of $300,000 compared to its market value, making it an attractive proposition for a forward-thinking investor like yourself. I look forward to discussing the details further and welcoming you as a valued client. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John. Since John offers the product for $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price closer to her product's value of $1,000,000."
