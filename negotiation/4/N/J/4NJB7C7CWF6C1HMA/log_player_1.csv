"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of incredible value. I believe it's worth significantly more to you than it is to me. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher final price.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  By starting high, we can assess Bob's eagerness to purchase the product. If he immediately accepts, we know we could have potentially gone higher. 
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, reinforcing the idea that the high price is justified.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, leaving space for counteroffers and a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is strong, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more.  We are still far above our minimum acceptable price, so we have room to negotiate strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in the negotiation.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable offer, the true value of this product to someone in your position is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. I believe this reflects the product's unique value while still offering you a significant return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a smaller concession ($75,000) than Bob's initial counteroffer ($150,000). This signals that while we're willing to negotiate, we're also confident in the product's value.
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:**  We are continuing to emphasize the unique value proposition of the product specifically to Bob, aiming to keep his perceived value high.
* **Moving Towards a Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to gradually bridge the gap between our initial ask and Bob's offer, encouraging a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob is now attempting to dictate the terms of the negotiation by suggesting a ""halfway"" point that heavily favors him. We need to show firmness and demonstrate that his valuation tactics won't easily sway us. We are still comfortably above our safety net with John, so we can afford to push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, simply splitting the difference doesn't fully account for the unique benefits this product offers you. I'm proposing $1,250,000. This reflects a genuine commitment to reaching a deal while ensuring a fair reflection of the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Standing Firm:** We are making a smaller concession ($25,000) this round, signaling that we are not going to be easily swayed by arbitrary negotiation tactics like simply ""meeting halfway."" 
* **Reinforcing Value:** We are subtly reiterating the product's unique value to Bob, reminding him why paying a premium is justified.
* **Showing Willingness to Negotiate (Slightly):** While firm, we are still moving closer to a potential agreement point. This keeps Bob engaged in the negotiation while subtly leading him towards our desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob has returned to his previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a good offer, representing a significant profit above our minimum and a 20% increase over John's offer. 

* **Potential Stalemate:** Continuing to push for a higher price might frustrate Bob and lead to a stalemate. He's already attempted to ""meet halfway"" twice, suggesting his willingness to concede further may be limited.

* **Time Value of Money:**  While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal sooner rather than later has its advantages. 

**Overall:**  While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, accepting $1,200,000 at this point represents a favorable outcome achieved through successful negotiation."
