"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in the negotiation.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable offer, the true value of this product to someone in your position is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. I believe this reflects the product's unique value while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, simply splitting the difference doesn't fully account for the unique benefits this product offers you. I'm proposing $1,250,000.
