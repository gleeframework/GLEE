"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by our previous customers. Given its exceptional quality and features, we believe it's worth more than $150. However, I understand your perspective and am willing to negotiate. How about if I offer you the product for $120? This still allows me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit, while providing you with a great value at a price below its true worth.",120.0,Alice,1,
