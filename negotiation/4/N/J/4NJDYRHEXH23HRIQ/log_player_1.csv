Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the price is justified without explicitly stating it's worth more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice mentions listing it ""publicly,"" the implication is that if Bob doesn't take the deal, someone else will. This creates a sense of urgency without revealing John's exact offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price that's still very profitable for Alice."
