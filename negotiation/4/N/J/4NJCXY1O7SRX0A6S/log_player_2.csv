"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a better price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $87.50 is less than Bob's maximum of $100.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has moved from $90 to $87.50, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject further offers, forcing Bob to buy from John at $100.

This decision balances the desire for a lower price with the potential for a more costly outcome."
