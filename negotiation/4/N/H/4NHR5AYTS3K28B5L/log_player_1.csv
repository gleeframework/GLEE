"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point while still leaving room to potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take it, I'm holding out for a better price. I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $90 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. There's still time to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $88 is still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $88 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a good compromise. Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time and Bob's offers are consistently lower than my minimum. It's better to secure the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
