"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,050,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would be a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. While I understand the value of the product, I am unable to agree to $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,075,000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
