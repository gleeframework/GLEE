"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're starting higher than your minimum of $120 to leave room for negotiation. 
* **It's within Bob's range:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $100, so $115 is still within his potential buying range.
* **It's a clear signal:**  You're expressing confidence in the value of your product while also demonstrating your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially since I have more rounds left and can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this sale. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is tempting, I'm still close to my minimum price and have several rounds left to negotiate. I believe I can get closer to $110 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I admire that. How about we split the difference and go with $109?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $107? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will budge much further. My minimum price is $120, and I'm currently at $107.  It's simply not worth risking the remaining rounds for a possible $3 gain.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and allows me to move on."
