"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This is a very fair offer considering the quality and what it can do for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to $12,000 for this to make sense for me. How about $12,500? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,500. If we can find a middle ground here, I'm confident we can reach a deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,
