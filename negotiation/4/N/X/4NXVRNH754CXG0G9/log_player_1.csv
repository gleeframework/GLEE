Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This is a very fair offer considering the quality and what it can do for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to $12,000 for this to make sense for me. How about $12,500? This offer reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,500. If we can find a middle ground here, I'm confident we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he will reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  Cutting my losses now and selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
