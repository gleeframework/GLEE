Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation, as it's below Bob's perceived value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation. I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but closer to my initial asking price. It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product at a higher amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is closer to my desired price point and significantly better than selling to John. It's time to accept and finalize the sale."
