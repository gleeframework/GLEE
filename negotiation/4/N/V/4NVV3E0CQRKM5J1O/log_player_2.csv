"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This product, tailored specifically to your needs and desires, is worth $1,500,000 to you. I am offering it to you at a special price of $1,400,000. This exclusive offer reflects my confidence in its quality and relevance to your requirements, and I believe it represents an excellent investment for you. Please consider this proposal carefully, and let's discuss how we can make this valuable asset yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value for the product ($1,400,000 vs. $1,200,000).** This means Alice is likely motivated to sell, and there might be room for negotiation.
* **The offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget ($1,400,000 vs. $1,500,000).**  While it's a good deal compared to buying from John, Bob can potentially get an even better price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options.**  

By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps his options open and potentially saves more money."
