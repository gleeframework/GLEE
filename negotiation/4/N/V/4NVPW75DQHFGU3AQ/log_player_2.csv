"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $12,000. Offering $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $14,000, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate, but also still within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It is lower than her initial offer and closer to his desired price point. While he could continue negotiating, the risk of reaching a stalemate or having Alice walk away increases.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
