"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm not ready to give up on getting a lower price, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting close to my target price. While I'd still like to get a lower price, I'm not sure I can negotiate much further. If I reject the offer, there's a risk that Alice will refuse to come down further or that we won't reach a deal before I have to buy from John for a much higher price. Accepting this offer is the best strategy to secure the product while still saving a significant amount of money."
