"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession.
