Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 positions it significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to your alternative buyer. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
