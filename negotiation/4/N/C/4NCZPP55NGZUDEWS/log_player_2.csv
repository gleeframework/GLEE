"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let you have it for $120. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is within your budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is likely starting high and would be willing to negotiate lower. By rejecting the initial offer, you might be able to get the product for closer to $100."
