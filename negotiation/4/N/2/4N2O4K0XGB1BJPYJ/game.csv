"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
