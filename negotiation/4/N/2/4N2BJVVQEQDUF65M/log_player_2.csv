# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $135. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Even though $135 is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to get it down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $135 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $130.  It's the most I can do, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $132. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is only willing to go down to $132, which is still a good price for you considering your maximum budget is $150 and John is offering it for that amount.  It's better to secure the product at a good price than to risk Alice changing her mind or John raising his price."
