"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a budget of $10,000, but I have to consider my own costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $11,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
