Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept on the first offer. This allows me to gauge his interest and start the negotiation process.  I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. While $900,000 is closer to my desired value, I'm still confident that I can push for a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a good test to see how close Bob is to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, it's a good compromise, and I'm satisfied with the final amount.  It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so there's no risk of losing out on a sale."
