Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000.

This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
