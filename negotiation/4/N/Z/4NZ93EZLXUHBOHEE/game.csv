"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in it.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",875000.0,Alice,3,
