"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500.  I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value for you. To be fair, I can move my offer up to $7,500.  Let's try to find a good compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offers, but I've already got another offer for $8,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need you to be closer to that $8,000 mark for it to make sense for me.  Can you go any higher?",8400.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for explaining the situation.  I can see we're getting close. How about $7,800? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",7800.0,Bob,6,
