"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's always worth trying to negotiate further. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially secure a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting, as Bob can always fall back to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a substantial discount.  $800,000 represents a 10% reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about negotiating a lower price. This counteroffer is likely to be within the range Alice might consider, especially if she's keen to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $850,000 is a good deal compared to John's price. It's reasonable to accept this offer, as further negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price, and Bob risks losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."
