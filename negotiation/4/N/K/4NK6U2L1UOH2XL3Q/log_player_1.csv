{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a  round number, which can make it feel more appealing.  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option, so I won't be afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's important to remember my goal is to maximize my profit.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,500 is simply not acceptable. I'll counter his offer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go below $10,500.  This price still offers you a significant value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has come up a bit in his offer, it's still not enough for me.  I'm close to my minimum price point, but I'm also running out of time and negotiation energy. It's better to sell to John at $10,000, which guarantees a sale at a reasonable price."
