"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This would allow us both to secure a fair deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to adjust my offer to $1,110,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,110,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  While $1,080,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,065,000. I believe this is a fair price considering both our positions.",1065000.0,Bob,6,
