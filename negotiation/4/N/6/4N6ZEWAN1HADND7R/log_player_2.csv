"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob can continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $11,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which would be a good middle ground for us. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is as low as I can go, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While there's a chance that further negotiation could bring the price down, there's also a risk of Alice not agreeing to a lower price.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to secure that deal and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
