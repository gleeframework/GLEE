"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $11500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500, which would be a good middle ground for us. Let me know if you're open to that.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is as low as I can go, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,5,
