"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's find a way to make this work!",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
