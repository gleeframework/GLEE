Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth and your potential interest, I propose we start our negotiation at $95. This allows us some room to adjust based on your feedback and preferences. Let me know if this sounds reasonable or if you have an alternative suggestion."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment. I'm happy to pay $85, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
