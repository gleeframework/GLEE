"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth and your potential interest, I propose we start our negotiation at $95. This allows us some room to adjust based on your feedback and preferences. Let me know if this sounds reasonable or if you have an alternative suggestion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
