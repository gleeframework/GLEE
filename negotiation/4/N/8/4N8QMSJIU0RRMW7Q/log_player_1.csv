Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to benefit greatly while acknowledging the value I'm providing.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer ($800,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The $925,000 offer sits comfortably between Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed in a way that invites Bob's perspective and potential for negotiation, leaving room for a slightly higher final price."
