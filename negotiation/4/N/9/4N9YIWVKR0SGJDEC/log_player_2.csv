"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $750,000.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your absolute limit is $750,000, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While $800,000 is still above your target price, it's a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks alienating Alice and potentially losing the deal. It's unlikely you'll get a much better price from her at this point."
