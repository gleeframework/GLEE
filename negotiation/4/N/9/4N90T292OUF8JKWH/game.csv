"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. I'm counting on this product to be a good investment, and I need to be mindful of my budget.",880000.0,Bob,4,
