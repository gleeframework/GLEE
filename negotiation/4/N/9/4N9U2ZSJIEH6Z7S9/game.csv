"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need a reasonable offer. How about $18,000? This is a compromise, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $18,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",12000.0,Bob,4,
