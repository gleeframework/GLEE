Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows John will buy the product for her minimum price, so she starts with a strong offer significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. Alice can then gradually reduce the price, aiming for somewhere above her minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase the product."
