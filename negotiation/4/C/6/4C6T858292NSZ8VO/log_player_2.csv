Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13,000.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,000, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,500, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000. This price is the lowest I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price John is offering. I hope you'll reconsider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $15,000 is still significantly more than Bob's desired price of $12,000.
* **John offers a better deal:**  John is selling the product for $12,000, which aligns perfectly with Bob's budget. 
* **Limited negotiation rounds:**  Only 3 rounds remain, and there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, especially since she's now offering the same price as John.

By buying from John, Bob gets the product at his desired price point, saves $3,000 compared to Alice's offer, and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
