"Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95. That's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you.  Let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to go any higher than $100. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",100.0,Bob,6,
