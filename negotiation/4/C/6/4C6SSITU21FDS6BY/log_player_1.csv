{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, giving him some room to negotiate, but also significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $150. This leaves room for both of you to find a mutually beneficial compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $150. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95. That's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired price of $150. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to go any higher than $100. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from someone else. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than the $150 I can get from John. This deal isn't worth the risk of further negotiation, so I'm going to sell the product to John."
