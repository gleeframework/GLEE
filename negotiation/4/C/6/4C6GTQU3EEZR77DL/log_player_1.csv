"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point but leaves room for compromise.  It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, which may make him more receptive to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $820,000 for your product. I believe this reflects its true value while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below the value I place on the product ($800,000 minimum).  I have 10 rounds, and I believe I can get a higher price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $820,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $880,000, which is a more realistic starting point for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 880000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation, I would like to propose a price of $860,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise and allows us to move closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I've got a few more rounds to work with, and I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $860,000 is getting closer, I'm still firm on my minimum price of $880,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 880000}
