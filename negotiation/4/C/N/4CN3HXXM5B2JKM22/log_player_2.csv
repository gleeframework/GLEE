"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  While Alice's offer is above the product's value to her ($120), it's still lower than John's price of $150.
* **You're saving money.**  Accepting Alice's offer means you save $10 compared to buying from John."
