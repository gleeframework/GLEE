"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I think this product would be a great addition to my collection, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose a final offer of $920,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price, but I really believe this product would be a great fit for me.",920000.0,Bob,6,
