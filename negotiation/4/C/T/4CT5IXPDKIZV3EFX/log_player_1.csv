Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,650,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to go up to $1,500,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.

Bob has met my fallback price, but I already have John willing to pay that amount. There's no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations with Bob."
