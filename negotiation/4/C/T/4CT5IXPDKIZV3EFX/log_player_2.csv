"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, as I value finding the right fit for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth attempting to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,650,000 is still above Bob's budget of $1,200,000, although it's closer to the middle ground.  Bob should continue negotiating to get a better price.  By rejecting, he can make a counteroffer and attempt to further reduce the price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,650,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to go up to $1,500,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
