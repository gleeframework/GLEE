"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but you can likely do better.**  You are willing to pay up to $10,000, so $8,000 is a good starting point. 
* **Counteroffers are a key part of negotiation.**  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:** A $1,000 drop from Alice's initial price shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leave room for compromise:** This counteroffer leaves space for Alice to meet you in the middle without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is slightly higher than your initial counteroffer.** This indicates she's willing to negotiate but is not yet at your target price.
* **There's still room for improvement.**  You can likely get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation.  
* **Buying from John isn't necessary yet.**  You're still close to your desired price and haven't exhausted your negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($7,000) and Alice's latest offer ($8,500).
* **Showing willingness to compromise:**  This counteroffer signals that you're taking Alice's offer seriously and are ready to reach a deal. 
* **Still leaving room for Alice to negotiate:**  While this is a higher price than your last offer, it's still lower than what Alice is offering, creating a potential agreement point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit.**  $9,000 is within your price range, but you're still looking to save more.
* **You have time to negotiate further.**  You have five rounds remaining, and Alice has shown some flexibility. 
* **Buying from John is still too expensive.**  Even though Alice is getting closer to your limit, there's a possibility of getting a better deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($7,500) and Alice's latest offer ($9,000).
* **Showing continued compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* **Reaching a potential agreement point:**  This price is likely within Alice's acceptable range and still saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close to your limit.**  $9,500 is only $500 less than buying from John, and there's limited room for improvement.
* **You only have three rounds left.**  The time pressure makes it unlikely you'll get a significantly better offer from Alice.
* **Buying from John provides certainty.**  While there's a chance Alice might accept a final counteroffer, John offers a guaranteed price that meets your budget. 

You've negotiated well and gotten a decent price from Alice, but in this case, it's smarter to secure the product from John and avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
