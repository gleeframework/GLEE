At this point, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate down, but her concessions are getting smaller. It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $825,000. While you could try to negotiate further, you risk her becoming firmer in her position or even walking away from the deal. Accepting the $825,000 offer secures a significant saving compared to John's price and avoids the risk of missing out on the deal entirely."
