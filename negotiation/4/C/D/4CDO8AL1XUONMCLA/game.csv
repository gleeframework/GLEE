"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to discuss.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us both to benefit from a successful deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my original proposal is more reflective of that. Would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However, $1,125,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my previous offer.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
