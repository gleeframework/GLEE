Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us both to benefit from a successful deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my original proposal is more reflective of that. Would you consider $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However, $1,125,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my previous offer.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob is clearly very interested and we've reached a price point that's significantly higher than my alternative offer from John.  There's little point in risking further negotiation and potentially losing a good deal."
