Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects the value it provides. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $15,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John.

You want to offer a price that is attractive to Bob while still exceeding your minimum and ideally getting closer to John's offer. 

* Offering at $14,000 gives Bob a potential ""deal"" as it's less than his perceived value. 
* This price also gives you a buffer above your minimum and is a reasonable starting point for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer.

**Important:** If Bob were to counter-offer, you should be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's offer doesn't meet your needs."
