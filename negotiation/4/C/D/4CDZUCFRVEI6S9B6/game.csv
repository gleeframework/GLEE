"I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. Can you consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $15,500? This price is still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this deal happen!",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $15,500. How about $14,750?",14750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $15,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a great price for the value you're getting, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's finalize this deal!",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you can accept it.",14500.0,Bob,6,
