"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, considering the value this product brings to your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but I need to be mindful of my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and allow us to move forward. Let's finalize this now.",975000.0,Alice,5,
