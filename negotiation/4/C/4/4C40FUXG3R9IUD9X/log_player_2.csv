Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, considering the value this product brings to your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and allow us to move forward. Let's finalize this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Alice is clearly trying to nudge the price upwards in smaller increments. While I could try to negotiate further, $975,000 is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's offer. It's best to secure the deal now."
