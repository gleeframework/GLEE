"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening Strong:** Starting at $1,200,000 is a strong opening price, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential profit he can make. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still High:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my target, and his counter-offer indicates a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Opportunity for Better Deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can potentially push for a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $800,000 is secure, but I believe I can get a better deal with Bob. There's still time to negotiate, and I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, considering the value this product brings to your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a healthy profit margin. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's worth to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential profit he'll gain.
* **Collaborative Approach:**  I'm phrasing it as a joint effort to find a mutually beneficial solution, encouraging him to be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but I need to be mindful of my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I still have room to negotiate.
* **Time is on my side:**  We're only in round 4. I have several more rounds to try and reach a more favorable deal.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can push Bob a bit further. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a deal and am willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and allow us to move forward. Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm making a final push to close the gap, offering a price that's very close to Bob's last offer. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I stress the ""fair deal"" for both sides, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise. 
* **Urgency:** I encourage him to finalize the deal now, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing him to accept."
