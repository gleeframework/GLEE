Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob a price of $110. Let's see if he's willing to meet me in the middle!"
