"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. Let me see if we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my current budget.  Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,500? This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",10500.0,Alice,5,
