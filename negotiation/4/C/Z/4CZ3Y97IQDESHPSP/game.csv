"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this valuable asset. However, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.  I believe this offer reflects a fair price considering its value and the current market conditions. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000? This offer represents a significant investment from my side while acknowledging the value of the product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
