Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price if we continue to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that's a significant difference from my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000 to move this negotiation forward. This product offers unique value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are getting closer to a price that surpasses my minimum, but I'm still willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can get closer to $1,500,000. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects my best effort to find a price that works for both of us."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 as my final offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to commit to buying it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has indicated that $1,300,000 is his final offer. This is below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation. I can secure a guaranteed sale at my desired price with John."
