Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $115 is my final offer. I think that's a very reasonable price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds.  She's dropped $35 over 4 rounds, and is still $15 above my maximum. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at the price I know is fair."
