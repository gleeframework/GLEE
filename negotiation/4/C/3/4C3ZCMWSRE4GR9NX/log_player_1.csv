Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point higher than your minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. It's important to be polite and confident in your offer, while also leaving open the possibility of a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it's closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price.  How about we settle at $8,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  While it's closer, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation that might result in a lower price. I'll sell the product to John for $10,000, guaranteeing my minimum profit."
