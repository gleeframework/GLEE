"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $775,000 and close the deal?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its true value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
