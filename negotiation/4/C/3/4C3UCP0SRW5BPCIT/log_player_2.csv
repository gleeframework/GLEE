"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $110 for it. This offers a reasonable advantage compared to the market rate while still providing you with significant savings. I trust this price will make it an attractive opportunity for you. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the market rate, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $100, Bob can save $10 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
