You can likely still get a better price than $1,150,000. Let's try another counteroffer."

While you might be able to get a slightly lower price, $1,125,000 is a good deal. You're saving $375,000 compared to buying from John, and you're only 5 rounds into the negotiation.  Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will walk away or that you'll run out of rounds."
