"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested but $120 seems a bit high. Would you consider a lower price?"", ""product_price"": 85} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I want to start significantly below Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation and signal that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** Offering $85 shows I'm serious but also significantly below her initial offer. This might encourage her to counter with a more reasonable price.
* **Polite and Open:**  Maintaining a polite and open tone is important for a good negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, $110 is still closer to her initial offer than mine.
* **Room to Negotiate:** We're still in early rounds, and there's room to negotiate further. 
* **Alternative:**  Remember, John offers a safety net at $150, so we don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 95}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to her price, but still pushing for a lower point. $95 represents a significant move from my initial offer and a reasonable compromise from Alice's counteroffer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** While we're not in the final rounds, I want to signal that I'm serious about making a deal, but not at any cost. 
* **Clear and Direct:** Keeping the communication straightforward helps to move the negotiation along."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me at $95, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we try $105 again? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down:** Alice is moving in smaller increments now, indicating she might be reaching her lower limit.
* **Target Price:**  I'm aiming to get the price closer to $90, and I believe there's still room to negotiate.
* **Limited Risk:** We're getting closer to the halfway point of the rounds, but John's offer is still a safe fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. To be honest, $105 is a little too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Offering $100 shows I'm willing to move significantly from my last offer, but not giving in completely. It's a strong signal that I'm looking for a final agreement.
* **Psychological Price Point:**  $100 is a clean and appealing number that might be more agreeable to Alice.
* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point of the rounds.  While I'm not desperate, I want to encourage Alice to make a decision soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! But I still think the product is worth a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling:**  Alice has repeated the $110 offer. This suggests she might be holding firm at this price.
* **Alternative Option:** With only four rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is increasing. John's offer of $150 is looking more appealing.
* **Final Push:**  I'll use the next round to signal I'm serious about my price and willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I've enjoyed this negotiation, but I'm running out of time. I'm willing to pay $100 for this product. If that works for you, I'm ready to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer. I'm reiterating the $100 price point, making it clear this is my limit.
* **Walk-Away Point:** I'm signaling I'm prepared to walk away from the negotiation if Alice doesn't accept. This increases the pressure on her to make a decision.
* **Time Constraint:** By mentioning limited time, I emphasize the urgency for Alice to agree to my terms. 
* **Polite but Firm:** I'm maintaining a respectful tone, but I'm also being firm about my budget and what I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're running out of time, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $110. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $110, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadlock:** Alice is firm at $110, and I'm not willing to go above $100. We've reached an impasse. 
* **Time's Up:** With only one round left, there's little chance of significantly changing Alice's mind.  
* **Acceptable Alternative:** John's offer of $150 is only $40 more than my target, and it guarantees I get the product. It's better to secure the item now than risk losing it entirely."
