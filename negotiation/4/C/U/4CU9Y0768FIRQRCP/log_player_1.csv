"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product with tremendous potential. My asking price is $1,500,000.  This is a significant investment, but I believe the value I'm offering will far exceed your expectations.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you're providing, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $900000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value.  Selling to John at this point would secure a safe and guaranteed $1,000,000, but I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls below my minimum acceptable price. I understand your budget constraints, but I believe this product holds immense potential. Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This offer reflects the significant value I'm bringing to the table and provides room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. This offer reflects a compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer guarantees a sale that is above my minimum threshold.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John at this point would secure $1,000,000, but Bob's offer is slightly better and lessens the chance of losing the deal."
