"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price of $1,500,000 as possible.  We'll see if Bob bites, or if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is still a good amount for Bob, as it's within his perceived value.  It's also closer to my minimum, and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now too low, and I'm getting concerned about time. It's still below my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing too much.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount, while keeping in mind that I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,550,000. This is just a little bit above my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping this is close enough to entice Bob, but still gives me a good profit. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John as the rounds are running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now well below my minimum, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my desired amount.  It's time to secure the deal with John and sell the product for $1,500,000."
