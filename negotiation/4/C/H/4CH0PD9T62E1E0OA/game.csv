"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Could you consider that price?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $155? ",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $155, which would be $147.50. Could you consider that price?",147.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue the conversation, but $147.50 is still a little lower than I'd like.  Let's compromise at $150.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets the deal done.",150.0,Alice,5,
