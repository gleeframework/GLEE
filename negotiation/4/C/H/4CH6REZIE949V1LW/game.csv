"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $108. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted rate.",108.0,Alice,3,
