"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer that is still within his budget, but also significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also leaves room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $108. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $108, which is within Bob's budget and a good price for a product worth $100 to Alice.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and losing time. Accepting this offer gives Bob a good deal and secures the product without risking going over his budget."
