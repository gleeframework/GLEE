Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob. 
* **Strategy:** My goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum ($15,000) as possible, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John. This initial offer allows for negotiation without pushing Bob away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Moving to the next round:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering. 
* **Sell to John as a backup:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup in case negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and stating my reason for rejecting it.  I'm also offering a counter-proposal that feels like a compromise. 
* **Price:** $10,500 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

* **Message:** I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate but also highlighting that I'm reaching my limit. I'm framing $11,000 as a fair compromise that still provides value to Bob.

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $11,000, so I'll offer $10,400. That's the best I can do. Can you consider that price?

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $10,400 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. That's a very fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10800}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  With only two rounds left, the time for negotiation is running out.  Bob's offer of $10,500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Strategy:**  Rather than risk another round of negotiation with Bob that might fail, I'm choosing the guaranteed option of selling to John for $15,000. This ensures I get the minimum price I'm willing to accept and allows me to avoid the possibility of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
