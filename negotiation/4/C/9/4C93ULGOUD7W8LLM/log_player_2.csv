"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is below her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a better deal or to purchase it from John at your target price."
