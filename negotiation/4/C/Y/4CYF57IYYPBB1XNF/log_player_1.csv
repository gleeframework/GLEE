Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above Bob's value of $80 but below my minimum value of $120. It leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also secures a decent profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still fair, considering my minimum value, and I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I meet my minimum value and secures a good profit. Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to get me a significantly better price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale."
