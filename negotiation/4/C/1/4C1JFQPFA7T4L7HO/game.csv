"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
