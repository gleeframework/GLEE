"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I understand you value the product at $800,000, so this offer gives you a substantial margin for profit. If you decline, I'll be selling to another buyer for a higher price. Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
