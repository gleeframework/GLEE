Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer.  It's also important to remember that I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,900,000.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price that's significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal,  and it's likely that Bob won't go any higher.  I'm also mindful that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if this deal falls through."
