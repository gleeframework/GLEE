""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,199,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 (your minimum acceptable price) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so any offer below this is likely to be accepted.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,199,999 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly, but still secures a massive profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position. This means Alice doesn't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no pressing need to sell the product immediately. If time is a critical factor, she might need to lower the price to ensure a quick sale to Bob."
