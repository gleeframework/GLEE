"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's important to start strong and see how Bob reacts.  This also allows me to gauge if he's genuinely interested and potentially willing to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'll proceed to the next round and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,300,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to my minimum price and provides room for further negotiation. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum but shows further willingness to compromise. With only five rounds left, I need to be more strategic and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I'm running out of time. With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a better deal. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is my minimum price.  It's a guaranteed deal and the safest option at this point."
