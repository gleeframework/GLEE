# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.

Alice has come down to $1,050,000.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's still a significant savings compared to John's price, and it's closer to my target.  I'll accept the offer."
