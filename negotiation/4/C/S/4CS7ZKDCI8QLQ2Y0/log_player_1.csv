{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob's valuation of the product is $80, so we have a bit of wiggle room. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but it's close. I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95, which is still above my minimum and also a fair compromise. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum and a reasonable compromise. Accepting his offer will secure me a sale and allow me to move on."
