"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of your product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000? ",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go while still making a decent profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
