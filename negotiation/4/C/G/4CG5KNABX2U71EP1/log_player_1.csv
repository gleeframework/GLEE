Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below John's offer ($11,999) leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Appear Confident:** The message implies the value of the product and presents the price confidently, potentially persuading Bob to accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes no further information about Bob's negotiation style or how badly he wants the product.
* It's a risk as Bob might outright reject the offer, forcing you to settle for $12,000 from John."
