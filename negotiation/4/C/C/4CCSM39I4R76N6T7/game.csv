"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This gives us both a fair price.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $90?  This is a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
