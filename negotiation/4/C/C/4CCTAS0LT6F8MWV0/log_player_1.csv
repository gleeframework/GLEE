Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe the product is worth more than $80. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 3 rounds left, and Bob still unwilling to budge much, I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob."
