Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for this product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents fair value for both of us.

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $800,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. It's time to cut losses and secure a guaranteed sale with John at your minimum acceptable price."
