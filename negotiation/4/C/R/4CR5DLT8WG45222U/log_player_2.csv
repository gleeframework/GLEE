"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to try and gauge Alice's flexibility. It's unlikely she'll accept this outright, but it gives us room to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $100 is still above our maximum budget. We should continue negotiating and try to get the price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $100 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

We're now proposing our target price of $80. This lets Alice know our limit while still leaving some room for negotiation if she's absolutely unwilling to go that low.  It also conveys that we're serious about buying at the right price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to our target price, but we're only $10 away from our backup option with John.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further, even if it's just a small amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting close, Alice!  I can tell this is a great product.  Would you be willing to do $85? That's about as high as I can go."",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, demonstrating our flexibility.
* **Sets a firm but polite boundary:** We reiterate that this is our maximum budget, emphasizing our commitment to $85.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** By offering a specific price, we encourage Alice to respond and hopefully close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad to hear that you're interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems unlikely Alice will come down to our price. She went up from $90 to $92, indicating she might be trying to push the price higher.  At this point, we're better off taking John's guaranteed offer of $80."
