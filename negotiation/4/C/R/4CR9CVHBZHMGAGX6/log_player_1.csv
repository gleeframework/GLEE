"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's below what the product is worth to him, but still leaves me with a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from his previous offer. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  It's likely he won't budge further. I'm not confident I can get a higher price with more rounds.  I'd rather guarantee the sale to John and avoid further risk."
