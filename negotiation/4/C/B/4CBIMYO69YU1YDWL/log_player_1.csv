Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm looking to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price.  $8,500 is still below my minimum value, and I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking for $9,500.  This is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $9,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and I'm running out of time. It's better to close the deal now than to risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to sell to John."
