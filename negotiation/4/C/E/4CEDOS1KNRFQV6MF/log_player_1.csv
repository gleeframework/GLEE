Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $950,000 for it. This price takes into account market conditions and my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've given it careful consideration, and I am still only willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I understand that this might not be the price you're hoping for, but I truly believe this is the best I can offer based on my current financial situation. I hope we can find a way to agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is being stubborn and I've already gone down a significant amount from my initial offer.  There's a risk of continuing the negotiation and getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum and saves time."
