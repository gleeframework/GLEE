Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $950,000. It's a great deal that's still below the product's value to you, but closer to my minimum price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not getting the price I want, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $975,000. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her starting price.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $975,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John."
