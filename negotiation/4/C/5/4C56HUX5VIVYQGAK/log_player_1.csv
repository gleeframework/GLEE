Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $12,500 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000). 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth to potentially reach a higher price.

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is above your minimum, it's far below what you'd like to get for the product. It's worth pushing for a higher price. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price that is more favorable for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still leaves some room for profit for me.  How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is above your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting a profit.
* **Counteroffer is below Bob's initial offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise.
* **Message is encouraging:** It focuses on finding a middle ground and keeps the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,250. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away completely. 

Accepting his offer ensures you secure a sale and a profit."
