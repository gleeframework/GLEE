Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price of $19,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly mention the product's worth to you, it implies value by using phrases like ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment.""

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer outright, knowing his maximum valuation is $10,000. However, it's a calculated risk to see if you can secure a higher profit margin before resorting to your guaranteed sale."
