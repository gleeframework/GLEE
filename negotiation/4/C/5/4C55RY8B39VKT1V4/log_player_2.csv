Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, but $900,000 is still too far off from what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant increase from your last offer and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
