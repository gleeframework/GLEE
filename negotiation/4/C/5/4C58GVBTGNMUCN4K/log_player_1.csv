Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $14,000 is really the lowest I can go at this time. I believe this product will bring you significant value, even at that price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4

Round 6

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for moving a bit on the price.  While $13,500 is getting closer, it's still a touch too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000?  That would work for me.
