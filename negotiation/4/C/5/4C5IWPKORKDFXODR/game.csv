"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, my initial offer was already a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest I can go.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. I need to make a profit, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",14000.0,Alice,5,
