Round 3
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems pretty firm on a price above our budget. We've tried negotiating down twice, and she's moved very little. It's unlikely she'll meet our needs before we run out of rounds.  We have a guaranteed option with John at $12,000, which is our maximum. It's better to take the sure thing than risk Alice not budging further."
