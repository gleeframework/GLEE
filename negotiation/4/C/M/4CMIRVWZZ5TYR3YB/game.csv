"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  To make this work, I can offer $9,000. Let me know if that's something you can work with.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $10,500. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting into this negotiation.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to pay $9,750.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate the offer, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to consider your last offer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price that's just $250 more than your last offer. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,7,
