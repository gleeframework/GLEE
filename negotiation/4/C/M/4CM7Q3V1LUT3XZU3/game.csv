"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable in your hands. My initial offer is $1,200,000. This reflects the product's true worth and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $800,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I've placed on it and also acknowledges your budget constraints.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, to make this work on my end, I'd need to see the price closer to $925,000.  What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. $925,000 is a more reasonable price, but I'm still slightly higher. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $975,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let me know if you're interested.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. I'm ready to close this deal, but $975,000 is just a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? That's my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
