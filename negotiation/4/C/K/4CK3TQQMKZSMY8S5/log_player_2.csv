Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can do $12,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great price for a product that's worth $15,000 to you, if I do say so myself. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is steadily coming down, and we're getting closer to her value. There's still room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $12,500 is still a touch too high for me. How about we split the difference and call it $12,000 even? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're now in the later stages of negotiation. Offering $12,000 accomplishes a few things:

* **It's Alice's value:**  She's unlikely to go lower, and this might be our chance to secure the best possible price.
* **Shows flexibility:** We've come up slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Time constraint:**  We don't want to run out of rounds and risk getting stuck with John's higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I think you're still underestimating the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Alice went back up on her price, indicating she's unlikely to budge from this point forward. 
* **Limited Time:** We're running out of rounds, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price than John's offer. 
* **Guaranteed Price:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $15,000. While not ideal, it's better to secure the product now than risk ending up with nothing after Round 10."
