"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at $115? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really like the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
