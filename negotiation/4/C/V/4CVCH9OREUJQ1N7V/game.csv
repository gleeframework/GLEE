"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further if needed.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $950000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1100000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1100000. I would like to propose $1000000 as a potential price for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued negotiation, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budgetary constraints. I would like to propose a final offer of $980000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $980000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give away the product for less than its true value. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price that reflects the product's worth. I'm willing to offer the product for $1050000 one last time. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
