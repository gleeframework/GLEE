{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It's also important to express a belief in the fairness of the price to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate further to get closer to my desired value."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1600000. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can close the gap further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I can offer $1620000, which is the lowest I can go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,620,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,620,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price,  $1,620,000 is a decent compromise, and it's getting close to my minimum. It's better to secure a deal at a slightly lower price than risk losing the sale entirely and needing to sell to John for a lower price."
