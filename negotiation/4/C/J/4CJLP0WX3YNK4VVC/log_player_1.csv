Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price of $150, giving me some room to negotiate. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming for a price that is potentially attractive to him while still being beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum price, it's too low for me to consider. I believe I can get a better price, especially since I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $150. I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $200 and Bob's offer of $150. It shows flexibility on my part while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum price. I hope this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer of $160.  While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise.  It's significantly higher than John's offer of $150, making it the most profitable option for me at this point.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the sale to Bob or having to settle for John's offer is too high."
