"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is my best compromise at this point. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you a little closer to the middle and offer $800000. This seems like a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $825000 again. I think this is the best price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,5,
