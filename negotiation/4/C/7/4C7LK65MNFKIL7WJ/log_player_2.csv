"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum limit. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still above your limit of $1,000,000.  It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,200,000 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is back to her original price of $1,200,000.  This means further negotiation is unlikely to get you a lower price. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further haggling."
