"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still significantly less than my minimum ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond with a counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that is still above his initial counteroffer, but lower than my first offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to accept it.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm adding a sentence suggesting we ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8750. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a little higher.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John.  I believe I can still reach a price that's both profitable for me and acceptable to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900 as a final compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product, and it would allow us to both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm framing this counteroffer as a ""final compromise"" to put pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Value and Happiness:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and emphasizing that we can both be happy with this deal.
* **Direct Question:** I'm ending with a direct question to encourage Bob to respond and make a decision."
