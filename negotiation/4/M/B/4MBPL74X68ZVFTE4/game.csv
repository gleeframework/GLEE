"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $20,000 represents the value I see in this product, I'm willing to meet you closer to your range. How about we settle on $17,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500? I feel this is a reasonable offer considering the market value.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's wrap this up. I'm willing to come down to $14,000 as my final offer. This is a great price considering the value you'll gain from this product.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your efforts in trying to reach a compromise.  $14,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer a final price of $13,250. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal now.",13250.0,Bob,8,
