Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your efforts in trying to reach a compromise.  $14,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer a final price of $13,250. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal now.

While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, his offers are increasing in smaller increments.  At this stage, it's unlikely he'll meet the minimum price I need. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
