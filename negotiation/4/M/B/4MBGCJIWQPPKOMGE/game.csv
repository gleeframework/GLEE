"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that is significantly lower than its worth to me. I understand the product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a significant savings for you, and a mutually beneficial transaction for both of us.  Consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident you won't find this opportunity elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
