"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I believe in its value and think it's worth more than $150, but I understand everyone has their own valuation. Let's start with an offer of $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the pitch, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I'd like to respectfully decline your offer. I believe the true value of this product is closer to $80, which is more in line with your perceived value. Let's aim for a fair compromise at $75. Looking forward to your response.",75.0,Alice,3,
