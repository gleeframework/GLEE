{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This offer starts with a moderate markup, giving Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially earn more than selling to John.  I'll continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a decent price, it's lower than my minimum threshold. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for you considering its value. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
