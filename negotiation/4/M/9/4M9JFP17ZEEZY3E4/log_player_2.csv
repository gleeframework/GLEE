"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, it's still above your desired maximum of $150.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the initial offer gives you leverage to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $130, which is still within my budget and represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This should encourage Alice to consider my offer, while still leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within my budget and represents a good compromise. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise, and I could end up paying more. It's also worth considering the time factor: the longer the negotiation drags on, the greater the risk of losing out on the product to another buyer."
