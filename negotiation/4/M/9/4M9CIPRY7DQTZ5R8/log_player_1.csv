Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $130 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate or counteroffer, while still ensuring I'm well above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100. This gives me leverage during the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is above my minimum, I believe I have room to negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm willing to counter his offer to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a compromise by suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer ($130) and Bob's counteroffer ($110).
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** $120 still provides a healthy profit margin above my minimum acceptable price ($100). 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This counteroffer will help me understand how serious Bob is about the product and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, can you meet me at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:**  $115 is a reasonable profit margin, exceeding my minimum acceptable price by $15. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Bob away, risking a sale altogether. Accepting his offer secures the sale and a good profit.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming. Accepting now allows me to move on to other potential deals."
