""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant returns you'll see from it."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a premium. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique advantages, but I still think the price is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk he might lower his offer. Accepting now secures a good deal."
