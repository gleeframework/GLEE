 I am starting the negotiation at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value to leave room for bargaining while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

I am lowering my price slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price well above Bob's initial offer and my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $105. Can you meet me in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $105 is a reasonable profit above my minimum. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away and having to settle for John's offer."
