Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $10500. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I have 10 rounds to work with, and Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate. It's worth continuing to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10750 for the product. This would be a fair compromise that allows us to reach a deal while still respecting each other's needs. Let's see if we can agree on this figure.
