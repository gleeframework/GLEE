"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than $10000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring if a lower price is possible. Buying from John immediately would be the safest option, but Bob might be able to get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500, which reflects the value I'm placing on this product.  Let's find a middle ground. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for improvement.  $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum, so it's worthwhile to continue negotiating. Bob can likely secure a better price by continuing the dialogue with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  I'm happy to offer $11,000 for the product.  Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11000 just doesn't cover my costs for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $11250? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's maximum is $10,000. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial asking price, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's worth exploring if they can agree on a price closer to Bob's limit, but he needs to be prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750 for the product. This would be a fair compromise that allows us to reach a deal while still respecting each other's needs. Let's see if we can agree on this figure."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that.  $10750 is still not enough for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, but she hasn't moved low enough for Bob to be comfortable.  $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum. With only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob won't be able to secure a price within his budget.  Rather than risk continuing to negotiate and potentially lose the opportunity to buy from John, Bob should accept the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000."
