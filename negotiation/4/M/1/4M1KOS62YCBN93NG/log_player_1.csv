Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 9500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than the product's worth to Bob, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives him some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is still a good profit for me and hopefully a fair price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even result in a lower price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
