Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll counter with a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still a bit high.  You have a few more rounds and John's offer as a safety net, so it's worth trying to negotiate further for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $980,000.  Let's split the difference and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 980000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $980,000. I'm still confident in the product's value, and I think we can find a better middle ground. I'll counter with a price of $1,015,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price that is above your maximum.  While you could continue negotiating, you only have a few rounds left and the risk of not closing a deal. At this point, it's more advantageous to take the guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000.  You're saving time and ensuring you get the product within your budget."
