"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll counter with a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $980,000.  Let's split the difference and close this deal.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $980,000. I'm still confident in the product's value, and I think we can find a better middle ground. I'll counter with a price of $1,015,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
