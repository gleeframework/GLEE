"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though I haven't provided specifics (this is common in initial negotiation phases).
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John, getting a deal closer to my initial ask would be ideal. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I am interested in purchasing the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I have room to negotiate and will try to steer him closer to my range. Selling to John at this point would be accepting a loss compared to what I could potentially get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While I understand your position, the value this product brings is substantial, and $1,200,000 falls short of that. I'm willing to meet you partway - how about we settle at $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer ($2,300,000 to $1,900,000) to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm still holding firm well above both his offer and my minimum. This leaves room for further negotiation while making it clear I'm not desperate.
* **Justification:** I'm vaguely referencing the ""value"" again, aiming to keep Bob focused on the potential benefits rather than just the price tag."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob would be willing to go higher. Accepting this offer ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
