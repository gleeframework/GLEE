# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You are already close to your goal of $1,000,000."

Alice has made it clear that she won't go lower than $1,050,000.  Since your maximum budget is $1,000,000, it's best to buy the product from John at that price. You'll save $50,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
