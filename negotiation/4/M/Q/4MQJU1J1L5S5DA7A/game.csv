"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
