"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,800. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9,800 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could we settle at $8,750? I believe that's a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,750. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and land at $9,000? This would be my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to accept $9,000. I've already gone above my minimum value of $8,000, and I'm not willing to go any further. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,250, but that's my final offer.",9250.0,Alice,7,
