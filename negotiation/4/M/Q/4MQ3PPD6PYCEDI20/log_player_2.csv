"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's offer.  Since Bob wants to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option open to potentially find a better deal. There's no immediate advantage to buying from Alice."
