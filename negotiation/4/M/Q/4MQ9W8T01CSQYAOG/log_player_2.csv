**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering the product at your maximum perceived value, there's no harm in seeing if you can get it for a lower price. Rejecting her offer allows you to counter-propose or see if she'll come down to avoid losing the sale. You can always buy from John for $800,000 if needed."
