**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently staying below $1,000,000 and incrementing his offers in small amounts.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly more appealing than John's guaranteed $1,200,000 offer.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob short and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
