"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product, but $20,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
