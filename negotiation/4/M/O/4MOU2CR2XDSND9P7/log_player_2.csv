"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. He has 10 rounds and knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so he has room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I'm interested, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal. It's closer to his desired price of $9,000, and he's already saved $500 compared to buying from John. While he could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject his offer and he'll be left with only the option of buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a solid deal and saves time in the negotiation."
