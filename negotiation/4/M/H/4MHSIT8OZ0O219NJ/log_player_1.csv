I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $12,000, giving me a profit if he accepts. It's also a price that could be attractive to Bob, especially if he values the product higher than $14,000.  If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for $12,000."
