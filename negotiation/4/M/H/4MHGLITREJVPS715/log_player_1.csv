Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant amount and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
