"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant amount and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,
