Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm asking for $925,000."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $800,000.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price of $925,000 leaves a significant portion of the potential value for Bob ($75,000) while still securing a substantial profit for you ($125,000 above your minimum). 
* **First Refusal Advantage:** By offering it to Bob first at this attractive price, you create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, increasing the likelihood he'll accept.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring Bob finds the offer too good to refuse."
