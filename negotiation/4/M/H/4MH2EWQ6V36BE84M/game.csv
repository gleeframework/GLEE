,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is significantly below my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I think that's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
