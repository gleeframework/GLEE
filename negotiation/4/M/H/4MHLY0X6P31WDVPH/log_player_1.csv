"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my desired range of $14,500. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget, I can't go as low as $13,500. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows you to get the product at a great value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your response. Given your last offer of $14000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13750. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $13,750 is a good price, and while I could potentially squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $12,000 is too high.  I'm confident this is a good outcome for me."
