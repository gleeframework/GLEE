Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment. Please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Room for negotiation:** The offered price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Value proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" aiming to influence Bob's perception of its worth.

By setting a high initial offer, you aim to anchor the negotiation in your favor. If Bob negotiates, you have room to decrease the price while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects the offer, you can confidently sell to John at your desired price."
