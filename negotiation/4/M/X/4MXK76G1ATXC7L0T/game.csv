"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original price.  How about $10,500? This is still a great deal for you as you value the product at $10,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,250? I think that's a fair compromise",10250.0,Bob,4,
