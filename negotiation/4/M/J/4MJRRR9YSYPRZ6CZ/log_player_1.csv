Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valued at $10,000, and I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My primary goal is to make the highest profit. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I can aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential benefit, subtly justifying the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:** This strategy assumes Bob perceives the product's value to be at least $10,000. If he doesn't, the offer might be rejected outright.
* **Negotiation Skills:**  I need to be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters my initial offer. I'll need to balance my desire for profit with the risk of losing him as a buyer."
