"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, as the product is worth that much to you.  I'm confident that this is a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know if you'd like to proceed! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product, and John is selling it for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. Rejecting her offer means you can still get the product for the same price from John."
