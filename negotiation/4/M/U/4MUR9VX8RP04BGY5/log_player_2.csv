"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. He knows he can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, so he has a benchmark to work with."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects our mutual interests."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,325,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  While Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate, especially since he knows he can purchase the product from John for $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I can go down to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute final offer.  It's a fair deal that avoids us going back and forth further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,300,000 is still too high for Bob. He knows he can purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a significantly better deal.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice, Bob should take the guaranteed lower price from John."
