"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects our mutual interests.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,325,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still above my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value to me and allows us to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I can go down to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute final offer.  It's a fair deal that avoids us going back and forth further. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,
