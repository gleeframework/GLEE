Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives Bob a potential ""deal"" while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting the exclusivity of the offer adds perceived value and might encourage Bob to act quickly."
