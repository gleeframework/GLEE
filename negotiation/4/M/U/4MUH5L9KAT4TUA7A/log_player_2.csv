"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting a valuable product at a price significantly lower than its worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000.  This still gives you a substantial discount while allowing me to recover a significant portion of the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution.
