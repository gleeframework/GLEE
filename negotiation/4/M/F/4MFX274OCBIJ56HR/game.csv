"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for $100. ",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet at $102? It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
