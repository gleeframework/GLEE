Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price will still yield a significant profit.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 is a high price, but it allows for a  substantial profit margin while still being potentially appealing to Bob. He gains a $300,000 advantage over the product's actual worth to him.
* **Exclusivity:** Emphasizing an ""exclusive opportunity"" might make the offer more enticing and encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no further information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond the given values."
