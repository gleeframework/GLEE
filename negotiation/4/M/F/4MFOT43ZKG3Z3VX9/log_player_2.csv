The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $120. That's still a good deal for her, but it's not the best for Bob. Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $130 is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $150.  There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate will just lead to more rejections and ultimately a higher price. It's better to accept and move on."
