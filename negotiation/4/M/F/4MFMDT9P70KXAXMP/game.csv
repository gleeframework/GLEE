"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still represents a significant savings for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting the sense we're not too far apart.  How about we split the difference again and go with $887,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.  Let me know what you think.",887500.0,Alice,5,
