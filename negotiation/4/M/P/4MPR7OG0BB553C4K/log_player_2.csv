"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He knows Alice's minimum is likely around $12,000, so he's offering a price that's a bit higher than that, but still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but is also trying to be fair and save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,250, which is a reasonable price for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'll end up paying John's higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase within Bob's budget and saves him money compared to buying from John."
