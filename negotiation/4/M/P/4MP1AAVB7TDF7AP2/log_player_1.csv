"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a price of $110. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  It's still above my minimum of $100, but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can secure a price closer to my goal of $100 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $105. This is a significant concession from my previous offer and is only $5 above my minimum acceptable price.  It shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal but still maintains a profitable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $98 is very close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get to $100 with just a few more rounds. There's still room for a small compromise from Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $100 if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm offering $102.  This is a small concession from my last offer but still above my minimum.  It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate and makes it more likely he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great deal for me.  I've reached my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It would be a waste of time to keep negotiating and risk losing Bob as a buyer."
