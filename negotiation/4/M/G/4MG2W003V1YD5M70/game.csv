"I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $75 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $85? That's closer to the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'd be willing to meet you at $78. Can you consider that?",78.0,Bob,4,
