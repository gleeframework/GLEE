Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $12,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down.  Even if he negotiates, you're likely to land a price higher than your guaranteed $10,000.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A slightly higher initial price might make Bob perceive the product as even more valuable. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** You know the product is worth $8,000 to him. Offering a price too far above that might make him walk away without attempting to negotiate.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Having John as a backup ensures you won't be left with an unsold product. This gives you leverage in your negotiation with Bob."
