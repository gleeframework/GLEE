Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1100000 at this time.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly below that.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This represents a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $1150000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can bridge the gap."
