Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'd love the quick sale, $110 is below my minimum threshold. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and see if he's willing to compromise. $115 is still a decent profit for me, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's better than selling to John for $120. It's worth closing the deal rather than risking a further decrease in price with another round of negotiations."
