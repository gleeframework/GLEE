Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is still higher than your initial target of $800,000, it's getting closer. It's important to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal. It's likely that Alice won't go much lower than this, and continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to her rejecting further offers or even withdrawing from the deal altogether.  Since this offer is within your budget, accepting it ensures you get the product and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely."
