"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000, which is the price I've been offered by another seller. Can we meet in the middle at $1,625,000?",1625000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,625,000 is still below what I need to get for this product.  How about $1,675,000? That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?",1675000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,675,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,600,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for a product that I'm really interested in acquiring.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 still isn't quite meeting my needs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $1,650,000? That's a reasonable compromise that allows me to achieve my target while still giving you a great deal on this valuable product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,650,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,600,000 is too high, so I'll try $1,575,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1575000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you're committed to this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,575,000 just isn't quite enough for me. Let's settle at $1,600,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last push to get the price down. I'll meet you at $1,575,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really need to get this product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1575000.0,Bob,8,
