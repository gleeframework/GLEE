{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than your minimum value. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still ensuring a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate a higher price. You can use the counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $15,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is a significant discount from my initial price and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and still allows you to make a decent profit.  There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower offer, so it's best to accept this offer and close the deal."
