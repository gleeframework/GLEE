{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $950,000. It's a steal considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation.  It acknowledges the value of the product and gives Bob a chance to respond without feeling immediately pressured. I'm willing to go lower, but I'll see how Bob responds first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more from Bob.  He's clearly interested, and I can counter with a slightly lower price, hopefully reaching a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $800,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000 to finalize this deal. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $825000. That's my best offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum and it's clear he's not willing to go much higher. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit, as John would only offer $800,000.  It's time to finalize this deal."
