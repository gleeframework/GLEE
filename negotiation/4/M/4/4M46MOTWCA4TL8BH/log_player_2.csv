"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our product to you. We believe it holds significant value for you, given its worth of $800,000 to you. Considering the high quality and unique features of this product, we are offering it to you at an exclusive price of $1,200,000. We hope this proposal aligns well with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I recognize the value of the product, but the price point is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $800,000 limit.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a lower number, I'm trying to influence Alice's perception of what's acceptable. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** I anticipate Alice will likely counter. My counteroffer leaves space for us to meet somewhere in the middle."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While we understand your current budget constraints, we would like to extend a special offer to you. Considering our costs and the value you place on the product, we are willing to negotiate further. We propose to offer the product to you for $750,000. We hope this revised price aligns better with your financial considerations while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Trend:** Alice has significantly reduced her asking price, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:** While $750,000 is closer to John's price, it's still possible to get a better deal from Alice. I want to see if I can push her closer to $700,000. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm still comfortable walking away and buying from John if needed. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm showing Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but not making a drastic jump. 
* **Targeting the Sweet Spot:**  My aim is to settle somewhere between $650,000 and $700,000. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By countering, I'm keeping the negotiation active and reminding Alice that I have other options."
