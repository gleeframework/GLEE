Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above my maximum value for the product. I'm aiming to save as much as possible, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer you $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it leaves room for both of us to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
