"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit your needs. I am willing to sell it to you for $95, which is a great value considering its quality and the benefits it provides. Let me know if this works for you!",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $90 for the product. This still represents a great value, considering the product's quality and benefits. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we split the difference and I pay $87.50? This would still be a good deal for both of us and help us close the deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
