"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $17,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $17,000 is significantly higher than both your $10,000 limit and John's $10,000 offer. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save the most money."
