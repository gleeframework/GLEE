"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, as it aligns better with my budget.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
