Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, as it aligns better with my budget.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
