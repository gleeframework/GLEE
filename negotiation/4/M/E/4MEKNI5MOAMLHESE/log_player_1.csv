I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't go below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still keeps me above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I won't settle for anything less than what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from him.  While selling to John would ensure a guaranteed $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer nets me an extra $25,000.  It's a small but worthwhile gain."
