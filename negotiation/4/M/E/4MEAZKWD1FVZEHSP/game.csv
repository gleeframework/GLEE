"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is a fair price, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $9000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $7500 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7000 just isn't enough for me to consider. However, I'm still open to working with you. Would you be willing to go up to $7800? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",7800.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $7800 is getting close to my limit. I'm willing to pay $7200 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",7200.0,Bob,8,
