Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $920,000 is still a good deal and significantly higher than my minimum value. Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility that Bob will walk away or I'll have to sell to John for a lower price."
