Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)"":**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 would be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message starts by highlighting the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000, which is a strong incentive.
* **Confidence:**  Phrasing like ""fair deal"" and ""significant return on investment"" projects confidence in your offer.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but always keep your minimum in mind.
* **Relationship Matters:** While getting the best price is key, consider the long-term benefits of a positive relationship with Bob."
