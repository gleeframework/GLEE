Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $2,250,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both parties, starting with a significantly higher price ($2,250,000) creates room for negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" we encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 
* **Justification:** While we don't explicitly state why the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, the wording implies that we believe it's worth more than the baseline.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** We don't know how likely Bob is to walk away from a deal. This offer assumes he might be willing to pay a premium to secure the product.
* **Negotiation:** This is just an opening offer.  We should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Having John as a backup buyer gives us leverage."
