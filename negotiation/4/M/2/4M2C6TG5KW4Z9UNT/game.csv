"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to consider that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is a bit too low, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
