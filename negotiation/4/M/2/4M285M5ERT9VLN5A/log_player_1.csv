Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $1,500,000, but you're also showing flexibility.
* **It's a strong opening:**  This shows you're confident in the product's value and are willing to negotiate but not give it away for a song.

Remember, this is just a starting point.  You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your assessment of his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true value to me while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than your minimum desired price.  You should try to push for a higher price.  By rejecting his offer, you open the door for a counteroffer that could bring you closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've given it careful consideration, and I would like to counter with an offer of $1,125,000. This price respects the value of the product to me while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has come up slightly, it's still below your desired price. At this point, the negotiations are getting quite lengthy and the potential for further concessions from Bob is unclear. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price and a swift transaction."
