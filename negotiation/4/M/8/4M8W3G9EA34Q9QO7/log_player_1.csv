Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob, while still ensuring you make a significant profit above his perceived value. 
* **Strike a Balance:** This price aims to be attractive to Bob (saving him $50,000 compared to your alternative) while still netting you a $150,000 profit above your minimum."
