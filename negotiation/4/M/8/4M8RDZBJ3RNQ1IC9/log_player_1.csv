Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us.

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,550,000 is a good price, and it's worth closing the deal rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for the same amount."
