Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is below the product's worth to Bob, giving him a reason to negotiate. 
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you are confident in your product's value and aren't willing to give it away cheaply. 

By offering a slightly higher price, you increase your chances of getting a good deal while still leaving room for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still a bit low, and there's potential to get a better price.  You're willing to negotiate, but it's not worth settling for the lower price just yet.  

By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you can try to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to potentially get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and I accept $11,000 for the product?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Middle ground:** This offer is a compromise, meeting halfway between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but still want a fair price.
* **Highlighting the value:** Reminding Bob that $11,000 is still a good deal for him emphasizes the product's worth.
* **Clear and concise:** The message is direct and straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand your position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,750 is still lower than your ideal price, it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer. It's also very close to your minimum, and continuing to negotiate might not yield much more. 

Here's why accepting is the best option at this point:

* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you keep rejecting Bob's offers, there's a chance he'll walk away.  
* **Opportunity cost:** If you reject and then sell to John, you'll get $10,000, which is only $250 more than Bob's current offer.
* **Time:**  Negotiating further might take more time, which you might not have.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures you get a decent price for the product, minimizes risk, and saves time."
