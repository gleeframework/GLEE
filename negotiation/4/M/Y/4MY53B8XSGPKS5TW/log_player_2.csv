"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can still save money by negotiating with Alice.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but you can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be very valuable to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is a good compromise.  It's still within your budget and significantly cheaper than buying from John. It's likely that further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and the potential of needing to buy from John at a higher price make accepting the offer the best option at this point."
