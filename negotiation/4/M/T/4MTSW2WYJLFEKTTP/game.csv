"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than $10,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be possible?",11000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you want, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession, so I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,,
