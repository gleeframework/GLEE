"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly better than Bob's offer and higher than my minimum."
