I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build a rapport with Bob by expressing confidence in the product and suggesting he'd enjoy it."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $100 is my minimum, Bob is offering my minimum and I can potentially get a better price from him. I will counter-offer in the next round."
