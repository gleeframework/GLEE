"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your initial price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.  How about we settle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $950,000. Would you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  Let's find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $987,500?",987500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate the movement. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $968,750?",968750.0,Bob,6,
