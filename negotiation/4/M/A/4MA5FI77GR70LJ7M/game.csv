"Alice,  $999000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $700000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can agree on this price, we have a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.
