While $850,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

While $825,000 is getting closer to my maximum, I'm not willing to risk going any higher. John is offering a guaranteed price of $800,000, so I'll go with that option to ensure I stay within budget."
