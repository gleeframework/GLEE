""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $18,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Anchoring Bias:** By offering a high initial price, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if you started low.
* **Fallback Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, he might have a higher limit. This offer tests that possibility.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This strategy relies on your ability to negotiate effectively if Bob counters. Be prepared to justify the value and potentially lower the price during negotiations."
