"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you while remaining fair to me.  I'm confident this product will bring you great value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
