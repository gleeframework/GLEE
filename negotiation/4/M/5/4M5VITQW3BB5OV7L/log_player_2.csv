"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Unknown:**  I don't know the true value of the product to Alice, so a $10,000 offer could be a great deal or it could be too high. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's room for negotiation. I can try to get a lower price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting and making a counteroffer is a calculated risk. If I can get a better price, I save money. If Alice walks away, I can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in your product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to test Alice's willingness to negotiate. This shows I'm serious about a deal but also emphasizes my budget.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""higher than I'm comfortable with""). This adds a touch of professionalism and shows I'm considering her offer.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I end with a question to keep the conversation open and see where she stands."
