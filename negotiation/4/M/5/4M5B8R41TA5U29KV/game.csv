"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and quality.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,200. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value and my costs.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,800 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us and ensure a successful deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,5,
