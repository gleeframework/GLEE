Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me some room to negotiate. However, I'm also aware that I can get $100 from John, so I won't go too low.  I'm aiming for a price that's fair but still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my ideal of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105.  This is still a good price for Bob, as he's willing to pay $95. It's also closer to my desired price of $100, and I'm hoping he'll accept. If he doesn't, I'm still happy to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is too low for me, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's better for me to sell to John and get $100, which is closer to my desired price and still guarantees me a profit."
