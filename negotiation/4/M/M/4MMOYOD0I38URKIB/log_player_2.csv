"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a budget.  While I can't go down to $10,500, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and closer to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price of $10,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my budget of $10,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I value our negotiation and appreciate your persistence.  However, I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the value of my product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is a final offer, as I'm also considering other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or Bob could end up spending more than his budget.  Given the option to buy from John for $10,000, it's the most sensible decision to buy from John and avoid any further risk or negotiation."
