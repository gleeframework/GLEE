"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $17,000 right now. What do you think?",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $19,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $18,000, but that's my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I might have to look at other options.",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle for $18,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about it. How about $18,500? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit on this sale.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,500 is still outside my budget. I can offer you $17,500, which is a fair compromise for both of us. If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to consider other options.",17500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $17,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can meet you at $18,000, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. If you're willing to commit to the sale at this price, I'll make it happen. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,7,
