"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $15,000 from John. Alice's offer is better, but there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price that still gives you a profit, and it's a significant saving for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice to try and reach a price closer to your target."

{""message"": ""I understand you want to make a profit, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. While you could keep negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will come down to your desired price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to purchase from John for $15,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product."
