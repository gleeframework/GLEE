"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* You can do better by rejecting the offer and either making a counteroffer or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. I can't go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures that I can still make a decent profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* You can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. 
* Rejecting allows you to potentially get a better deal with Alice or simply buy from John."
