"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. I can't go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures that I can still make a decent profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll be happy with in the long run.",9500.0,Bob,4,
