Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. While I'd prefer a bit more, the risk of him walking away and me having to settle for John's offer outweighs the potential gain from further negotiation.  $1,250,000 is a decent profit and I'll take it."
