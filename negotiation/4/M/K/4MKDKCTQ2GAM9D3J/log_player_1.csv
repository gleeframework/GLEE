Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for a significant profit margin is reasonable.
* **Justification for price:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at its potential, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The message invites Bob's thoughts, leaving room for potential counter-offers and negotiations. 

This strategy maximizes potential profit while acknowledging Bob might try to negotiate a lower price."
