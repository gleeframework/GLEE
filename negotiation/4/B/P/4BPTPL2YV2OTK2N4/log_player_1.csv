Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price and negotiate down if needed. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product's value might even be higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (""limited time,"" ""fair price"") makes it seem less arbitrary and more palatable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests a willingness to discuss the price further, making Bob more likely to engage rather than just rejecting the offer outright. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can then propose a slightly lower price, still aiming to maximize profit while staying above her minimum."
