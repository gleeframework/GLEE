"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the product's value.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
