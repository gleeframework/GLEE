Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $12,000, I'm aiming to set a high anchor point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffer might be closer to my desired price than if I had started lower.
* **Preserving Value:** It's important to convey the product's value to Bob. By highlighting its benefits, I'm aiming to justify the higher price tag.

It's important to note:

* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me a strong bargaining position. I'm not desperate to sell below $10,000.
* **Flexibility:** While I have a target price, I'm open to negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I initially aimed for a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 matches the amount John is willing to pay. 

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I receive the minimum value I've placed on the product.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Prolonging the negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. There's a risk Bob might lower his offer, or the negotiation might stall altogether.
* **Time Value of Money:** A sale today is generally preferable to a potentially uncertain sale in the future."
