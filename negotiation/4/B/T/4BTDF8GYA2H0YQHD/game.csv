"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe $1,800,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $2,100,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work. However, $1,600,000 is cutting it too close. I'm willing to accept $1,750,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This offer reflects the significant value you're getting and represents a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
