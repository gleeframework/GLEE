"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to negotiate closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,750,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,400,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get closer to $1,500,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I see your commitment to making a deal. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1,450,000. This gives us both a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, let me know if you can accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $1,300,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum desired price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already made several concessions.  It's time to cut my losses and move on.  I'm confident I can secure the full $1,500,000 from John."
