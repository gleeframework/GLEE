"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,750,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,400,000. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I see your commitment to making a deal. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1,450,000. This gives us both a fair deal. What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, let me know if you can accept it.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
