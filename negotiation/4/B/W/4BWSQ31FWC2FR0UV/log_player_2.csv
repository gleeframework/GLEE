"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm seeing your price range, but I need to get at least $85 for this to make sense for me.  How about we split the difference on your last offer and call it a deal?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to come down slightly to $82, but that's my absolute final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $82, and it's not worth the risk of her sticking to that price. Buying from John for $80 guarantees the best price."
