"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price.  While $90 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would you consider that?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm seeing your price range, but I need to get at least $85 for this to make sense for me.  How about we split the difference on your last offer and call it a deal?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $75? It's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to come down slightly to $82, but that's my absolute final offer.  Take it or leave it.",82.0,Alice,7,
