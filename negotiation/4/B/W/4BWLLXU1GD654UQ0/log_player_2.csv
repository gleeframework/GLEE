"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  While my offer is low, I'm maintaining a polite and reasonable tone to keep the negotiation going smoothly.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $60. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $90? It's a great deal for you, and I'm still making a good profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $90 is closer to my budget, but it's still more than I want to pay, especially knowing I can get it for $80 from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, so I'll try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $70? That's a fair price, and I'd be ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my limit by suggesting $70, which splits the difference between her last offer ($90) and my previous one ($60).
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning I'm ""ready to close the deal today,"" I'm adding a bit of urgency, hoping Alice might be more inclined to accept.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John's offer of $80, so I won't go higher than that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached My Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, which is still more than John's offer.
* **No More Room to Negotiate:** Alice framed her last offer as a final compromise.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** I'm confident I can get the product for $80 from John without further negotiation."
