"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $60. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $90? It's a great deal for you, and I'm still making a good profit.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $70? That's a fair price, and I'd be ready to close the deal today.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make it work.",85.0,Alice,5,
