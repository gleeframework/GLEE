"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,400,000 vs. $1,200,000). 
* This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, rejecting the offer allows for a potential counteroffer that could save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us both, that price point undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This reflects the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point, but is still higher than Bob's ideal.
* At this stage, accepting the offer is the best strategy for Bob:
    * The price ($1,375,000) is within Bob's budget and is a significant saving compared to buying from John.
    * Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it's not guaranteed. There's a risk that Alice might reject future counteroffers, leading to a stalemate.
    * The cost of further negotiation (time and effort) may outweigh the potential gains in price reduction."
