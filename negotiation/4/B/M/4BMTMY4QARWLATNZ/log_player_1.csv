Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $500,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I know we're both looking for a deal that makes sense.  $650,000 is closer, but to be honest, I can't go higher than $620,000.  That's truly the most I can afford, and I think it's very fair given the market value.
