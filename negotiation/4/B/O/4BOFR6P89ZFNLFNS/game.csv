"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this under $110.  Would you be willing to do $108? ",108.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $112. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
