Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message to build rapport with Bob, and then proposes a price that is higher than his perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to keep in mind that while John offers a guaranteed $150, the goal is to maximize earnings. It's possible to get closer to that figure with Bob by starting with a high offer and then seeing how the negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below the product's worth to Alice. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potential for a better price. There's still a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $140 was a bit high.  $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
