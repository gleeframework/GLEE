"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more money by counteroffering.  There's no information about the value of the product to Alice, so there's a chance she'll be willing to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to accept $10,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm happy to consider your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down a bit, but Bob can still potentially save more money.  Since John is offering the product for $15,000, Bob has room to negotiate with Alice and try to get closer to his $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That way, we both can walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal on this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's target of $10,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best option as it's a significant discount from John's price and avoids further negotiation."
