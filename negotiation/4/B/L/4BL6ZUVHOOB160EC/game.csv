"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth in the current market.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still quite a ways off from what I have in mind. This product has the potential to generate substantial returns, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $2,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the potential of this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,950,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1925000.0,Bob,6,
