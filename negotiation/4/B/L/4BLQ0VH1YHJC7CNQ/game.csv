"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value of the product,  $800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $500000,  given my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $650000. It's a fair compromise, considering the unique benefits this product offers. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $650000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $575000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",575000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $700000.
