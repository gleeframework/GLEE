"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price for this valuable product. Let's meet halfway and close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still not enough to cover my expenses.  To show good faith, I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
