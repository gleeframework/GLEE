Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
