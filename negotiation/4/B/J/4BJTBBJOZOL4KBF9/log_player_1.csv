Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm looking for a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to accept. I believe there's still room for a better price.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target by countering Bob's offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it would bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product would bring to my business. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but it's getting late in the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the safest option."
