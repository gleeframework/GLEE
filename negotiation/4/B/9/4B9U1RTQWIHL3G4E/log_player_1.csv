This offer starts at a price that gives you some room to negotiate while still ensuring you make more than your minimum.  It also sets a positive tone by acknowledging Bob's potential interest."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the recommendation. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and appreciate the adjustment. I would like to counter with an offer of $125 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's a reasonable compromise. Selling to John would only net me $100, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
