"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. It's still a great product, but I'm on a tight budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $1300000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1375000?  It's a fair price that still allows you a significant profit margin. What do you say?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $1375000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1325000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my limits.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
