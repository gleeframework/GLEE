"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a significantly lower price to maximize savings.  We have plenty of rounds left to work towards a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, $1,100,000 is considerably higher than I'm willing to pay. I value this product at a maximum of $800,000.  To be fair, I'd be willing to offer $650,000.  This leaves room for negotiation and a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account your valuation of the product, while also allowing me to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, $900,000 is still too high. We're getting closer to my fallback option of buying from John. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. To be completely transparent, I can purchase the product from another seller for $800,000. I'm willing to offer you $725,000 as a show of good faith and my genuine interest in making a deal with you. "",
""product_price"": 725000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** I'm revealing my fallback option to Alice. This adds a level of urgency and emphasizes my desire to negotiate a fair deal with her specifically.
* **Strategic Offer:** Offering $725,000 is a significant jump from my previous offer. It demonstrates willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Time Pressure:** By revealing my alternative, I subtly introduce a time constraint. Alice needs to decide if she'd rather make a deal with me now or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to show good faith. However, $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. My next counteroffer is $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $875,000 is her bottom line.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Buying from John for $800,000 makes more sense at this point to secure the best possible price and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations."
