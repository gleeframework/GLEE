"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects the product's worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $825,000. Can you consider that?",825000.0,Bob,4,
