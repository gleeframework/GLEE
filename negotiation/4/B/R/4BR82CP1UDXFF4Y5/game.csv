"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to counter with $950,000. This price is still well within your desired range and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This price still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. I believe the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer for now.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000.  This would be a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm not willing to meet you at $1,025,000. I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $1,080,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  Let's reach a deal on this.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1,090,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider selling to John.",1090000.0,Alice,9,
