Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to counter with $950,000. This price is still well within your desired range and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can work something out.
