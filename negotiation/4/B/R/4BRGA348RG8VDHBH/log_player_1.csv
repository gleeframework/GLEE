Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the valuation.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $2,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 2050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $2,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the next round."
