"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I'm looking to get the best deal possible. Can we meet in the middle?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price is fair considering the product's value and your potential gain.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can we meet at this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
