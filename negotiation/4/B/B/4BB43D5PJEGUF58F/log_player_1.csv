Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to still get a good return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $900,000, Bob is still getting a good deal compared to his own valuation of $800,000. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're leaving room for negotiation, but you're not giving away too much.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without forcing you to immediately sell to John for $1,000,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer:

While it's tempting to continue negotiating with Bob, his final offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk further negotiations with Bob that might not result in a better offer."
