Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations.  To be honest, anything under $1,800,000 isn't going to be worth my time.  That's my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her $1,800,000 offer. It's better to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $1,000,000."
