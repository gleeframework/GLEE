Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is beneficial for both parties is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA. Bob has a strong incentive to negotiate since he's getting a good deal compared to its actual worth to him.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering what you could gain from it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Justifiable:** $1,450,000 leaves you room to negotiate while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:** The message focuses on the ""unique value and potential"" to nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone encourages discussion, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer without feeling pressured.

**Important Note:**  This is just one offer strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style (e.g., if he's known to be very price-sensitive), you might adjust your starting price."
