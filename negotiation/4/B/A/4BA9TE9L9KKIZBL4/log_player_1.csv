{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is a price that is still potentially appealing to Bob while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition of the product.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I am not starting at the maximum I would accept ($120) to allow for potential counteroffers and a successful negotiation. 
* **Always ready to sell to John:**  The threat of selling to John for $120 acts as a safety net and ensures I won't accept offers below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While his offer is low, it's still possible to negotiate a higher price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup option gives me the leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110? This is a fair price considering the quality of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $115 offer. 
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and implying that my offer is still a good deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm expressing willingness to continue negotiating to find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly and professional tone to encourage continued conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to counter with an offer of $105 for the product. This is the highest amount I can reasonably offer given my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** While his offer is close, it's worth exploring if he's willing to go a little higher.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm not in a rush to sell, and John's offer of $120 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer, hoping to close the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing that we are very close to an agreement, hoping to increase the pressure on Bob to accept."
