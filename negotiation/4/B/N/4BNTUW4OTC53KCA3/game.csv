"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $900,000.  Would that be agreeable to you?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
