"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's very fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $950,000.  This gives you a significant advantage, and it ensures I get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,1,
