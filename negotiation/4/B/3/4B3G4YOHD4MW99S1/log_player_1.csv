Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a good starting point. It's a price higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the conversation.

By starting with a relatively high price, I can potentially maximize my earnings.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can then assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  He has already demonstrated his interest in the product, and I'm confident that with a counteroffer, I can reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $105:** This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some profit margin. 
* **Friendly Tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** It highlights the ""great deal"" Bob would still be getting and acknowledges the need for a price that works for both of us.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially seal the deal with Bob, who has already shown interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can meet in the middle 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $105, Bob's offer of $95 is a good compromise.  It's significantly better than selling to John for $80, and it seems like Bob is firm on his offer.  It's time to secure the deal and avoid risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
