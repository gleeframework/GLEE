"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1400000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. My revised offer is $1350000. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a move in the right direction, but still above Bob's desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,325,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $1325000. My revised offer is $1320000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is very close to Bob's previous counteroffer of $1,325,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor price adjustments.  Accepting the offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting future counteroffers or the need to buy from John at a higher price."
