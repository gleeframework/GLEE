"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now.  I'm willing to offer $1300000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. My revised offer is $1350000. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $1325000. My revised offer is $1320000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
