Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.  It also provides a buffer in case Bob makes a counteroffer that's too low.  

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's valuation.  I hope this encourages him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm worried that the back-and-forth might drag on and I could end up with a price that's too low. I'd rather secure the sale with John for my desired $1,200,000."
