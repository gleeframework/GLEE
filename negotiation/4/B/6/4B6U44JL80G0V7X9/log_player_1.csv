Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $9,500 is above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for him to counter-offer and for you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** If you offer a price too close to $10,000, Bob might feel he doesn't need to negotiate.  

By starting at $9,500, you leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit."
