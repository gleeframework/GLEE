"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1200000. Let me know if you're interested!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1200000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1350000 and $1250000, which is $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.
