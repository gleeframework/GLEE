Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're ensuring you get at least $1,000,000, your minimum acceptable price. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** Leaving room for negotiation and potential for Bob to accept. 
* **It signals you're serious:** You're not just throwing out a lowball offer, showing you're open to a deal.

**Important:** This is just the first step. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses and the potential of John's offer becoming more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $1,350,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price:** While it's closer to your goal than his initial rejection, you are still leaving $50,000 on the table.
* **You have room to negotiate:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, evidenced by his counteroffer. This gives you leverage to push for a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you have a guaranteed fallback option.

**Next Steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer. Aim for a price closer to your initial offer of $1,400,000. You might try a counteroffer of $1,380,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,380,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1380000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  Your counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between your previous offer and Bob's.
* **Maintaining leverage:** You're not giving in completely. You're still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasizing value:** You're reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making it clear that $1,380,000 is still a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Be prepared for a potential negotiation:** Bob might accept, reject, or counter your offer. 
* **Keep John's offer in mind:**  If the negotiation stalls or you feel like you're not getting a good enough price, you have the option to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my financial constraints, I can only consider $1,360,000 for your product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  While $1,360,000 is still below your ideal price, it's only $40,000 away from your minimum acceptable price of $1,320,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and you might be able to get a slightly better price in future rounds. However, there's no guarantee of this.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer might lead to a stalemate or a lower offer in the next round. There's also the chance that Bob might withdraw his offer altogether.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If you're unhappy with the final price, you can always sell to John. 

**Conclusion:**

At this point, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most prudent decision. You're getting a good price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome. You're also mitigating the risk of losing the deal entirely."
