"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still below the market value of similar products. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
