"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you a chance to own this unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a time-sensitive opportunity, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we settle on $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,025,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about $950,000? I think that's a fair price that allows me to benefit from the product while recognizing its true value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $985,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",985000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come up a bit to $970,000. I believe this reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your position.  Do we have a deal?",970000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're a tough negotiator, I'll give you that!  Let's wrap this up. What if we split the difference and call it $975,000?  It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can both move on to other things.",975000.0,Alice,7,
