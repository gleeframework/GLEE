Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that Bob will find this offer appealing given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, and I believe Bob will be more willing to accept it after rejecting my initial offer."
