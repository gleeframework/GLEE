"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal. He values the product at $1,200,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $800,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's minimum, but still leaves some room for further negotiation. This is a reasonable starting point for the counteroffer, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's desired price of $1,200,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away or increase her price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price that is within his budget and significantly cheaper than John's offer."
