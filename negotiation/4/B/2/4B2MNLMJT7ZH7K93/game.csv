"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $15000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $12000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $15000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $12000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $15000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13250.0,Alice,5,
