"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $1,200,000. It's worth rejecting and seeing if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. Given my budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant potential and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,700,000 is still above my budget.  While it's closer to my limit, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll continue negotiating and try to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
