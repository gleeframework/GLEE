# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I want to be upfront with you - it's worth at least $1000000 to me. With that in mind, I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm looking for a serious buyer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
