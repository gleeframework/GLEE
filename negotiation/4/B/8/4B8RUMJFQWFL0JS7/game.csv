"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $8000 is a significant price difference. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12000 is my absolute minimum. Would you be open to considering a price closer to the middle ground, say $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11000, but I'm still a bit shy of that. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $9500. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $10250 is the absolute lowest I can go at this point.  Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
