"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This achieves a few things:
    * **Anchoring:** It sets a high reference point for the negotiation.
    * **Room to Negotiate:** Provides ample space to come down during the subsequent rounds.
    * **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  His reaction to this initial price will give me insight into his eagerness and potential flexibility.

* **Justifying the Price:** While the number is high, I'm framing it around the ""unique value and potential"" of the product. This subtly suggests there's more to the product's worth than Bob might currently realize.

* **Openness to Discussion:** I want to avoid coming across as inflexible.  The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" signals my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant move from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than my target.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Continue Negotiating:** There's room to work towards a more favorable price.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** Accepting too quickly might signal desperation, potentially leading Bob to undervalue the product further.

I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob over the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,800,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a figure closer to my initial proposal.  Would you be willing to consider $2,000,000?  I believe this represents a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone by recognizing his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $200,000 from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Holding Firm (For Now):** I'm not ready to drop below $2,000,000 yet. This price still provides a substantial buffer above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Framing as Compromise:**  By using the word ""compromise,"" I'm subtly suggesting that this revised offer is already accounting for his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John is an option, I believe there's room for negotiation with Bob.  I'm willing to counter-offer again to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're serious about this purchase.  To be completely transparent, $1,600,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Fairness:** I'm being more direct now, indicating his offer is too low while also emphasizing fairness to encourage a similar approach from him.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This tactic is often perceived as a balanced solution. By suggesting $1,850,000, I'm splitting the difference between his last offer and my previous counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, time is a factor. Moving closer to Bob's price implies a willingness to close the deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,850,000. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While still below my initial target, $1,700,000 represents a significant profit over my minimum and is a reasonable compromise. Here's why accepting now makes sense: 

* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller concessions from Bob.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now brings in a substantial sum that I can invest or utilize elsewhere. Waiting longer has an opportunity cost.
* **Relationship Preservation:**  Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to make a deal and can foster goodwill for potential future interactions.

While I could push for more, the potential gains are likely outweighed by the risks of alienating Bob and potentially losing the sale altogether."
