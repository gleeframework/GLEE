"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",10800.0,Alice,5,
