Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my maximum limit is $1000000, I'm happy to offer you $800000 for the product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into finding a buyer like you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
