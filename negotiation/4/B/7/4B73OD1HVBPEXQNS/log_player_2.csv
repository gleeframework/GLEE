"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. My initial offer is $2000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is far outside of Bob's budget, so it makes sense to immediately reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my maximum limit is $1,000,000, I'm happy to offer you $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if you're open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1200000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is a significant improvement from her initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal target. There's room for further negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to lower the price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a more substantial discount.  I'm ready to offer $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $1000000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into finding a buyer like you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is the same price as John's offer. Since Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, he should choose to buy from John and avoid the potential risk of further negotiation with Alice."
