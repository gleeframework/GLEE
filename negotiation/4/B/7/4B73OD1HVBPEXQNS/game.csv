"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. My initial offer is $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my maximum limit is $1000000, I'm happy to offer you $800000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if you're open to negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1200000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1200000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a more substantial discount.  I'm ready to offer $900000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $1000000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into finding a buyer like you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
