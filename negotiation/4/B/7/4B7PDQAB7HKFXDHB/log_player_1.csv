{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still below my minimum asking price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him a sense of urgency and makes him more likely to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you don't undervalue the product.
* **It's a round number:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not desperate.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but not so low that it's a bad deal for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** By lowering the price from my initial offer, it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintains a strong position:**  $11,000 is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum value.
* **Provides a clear and concise message:**  It makes it easy for Bob to understand my position and respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, $10,750 is still too far below my minimum.  I'll counter one more time, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,750 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Sets a firm deadline:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Maintains a strong stance:**  I'm not budging from my position any further.
* **Reiterates my value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than his offer. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to move on to John."
