{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's much closer to my maximum than it is to her minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a little high for me, would you consider $70?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'll hold firm for now and see if she's willing to go lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your target, but I'm still a bit above it. I can do $82.50, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $82.50 saves me a decent amount compared to John's price."
