# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's room to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm proposing $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers you a good deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget.  It's worth rejecting her offer and continuing to negotiate.  You've already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice seems open to further negotiation. There's still a good chance you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair offer that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial limits.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm proposing $1,550,000. This is a fair offer that considers both our needs.  Let's reach an agreement and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, $1,550,000 is still slightly above your limit. You have a few rounds left, and it's worth pushing for a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price further to close the deal.  You also have the option of buying from John at $1,500,000 if you can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
