{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident this offer is attractive to Bob, but I'm also prepared to accept a lower price if he's insistent on getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get closer to its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I've lowered my offer to show flexibility.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired range.  I'm willing to accept $8,750 to secure the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
