Let's start with a realistic price.  $1,000,000 is my absolute maximum, but I'm open to discussing a price closer to that number."

Alice is still asking too much. While her offer is better than the initial one, I'm still not willing to pay more than $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can get closer to that price."
