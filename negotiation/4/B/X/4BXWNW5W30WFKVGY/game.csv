"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to start with an offer of $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I could potentially do $9,000, but that's really pushing my budget.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250 was a bit too high, but I can do $9,125. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",9125.0,Alice,7,
