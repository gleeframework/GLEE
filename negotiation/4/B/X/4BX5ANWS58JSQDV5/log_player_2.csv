"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $115 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $122 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to push for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $122 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's try $118. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can agree on a price."", ""product_price"": 118}
