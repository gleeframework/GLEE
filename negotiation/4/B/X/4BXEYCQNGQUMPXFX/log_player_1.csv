Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, I want to leave him some room to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **My Value:** This price still gives me a significant profit above my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves space for potential counteroffers and negotiation without risking a deal that's too low for me.

**Important Note:** I'm setting a high initial offer to see if Bob is truly serious about buying and what his negotiation style is. I'm also keeping in mind the ""John"" alternative, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, but it's still closer to my target than selling to John. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob's initial offer and my minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want it to be. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more time to get closer to my goal.  There's a good chance that Bob might increase his offer if he really wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is my last attempt to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John. I believe this price is still fair, considering Bob's initial offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge further. I've reached my limit in terms of lowering my price and I don't want to risk further negotiation that could result in a lower offer.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 is still a decent outcome,  ensuring I get my minimum value and avoid any further potential losses."
