I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a comfortable margin above my minimum value of $12,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. It still gives me a good profit margin and hopefully encourages Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,050 is just above my minimum acceptable price, and  further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.  It's better to accept and close the deal now than risk losing him completely and having to settle with John for a lower price."
