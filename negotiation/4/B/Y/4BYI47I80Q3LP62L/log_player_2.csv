"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness about buying the product while also pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Since he has already rejected a higher price and made a counteroffer, he can continue to negotiate. Rejecting again shows Alice he is serious about getting a better deal and might prompt her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is now $8,750. This is a slight increase from his previous offer, but still within his budget. It shows that he is willing to compromise but is still pushing for a fair price. This strategy aims to find a middle ground between their positions and encourage Alice to accept a price closer to his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has come down significantly, $8,875 is still above Bob's maximum budget. He has shown willingness to negotiate and has only 5 rounds left. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been consistent in his negotiation, demonstrating his willingness to pay slightly above $8,000 but staying firm on his budget.  He now goes slightly below his desired price. This counteroffer is risky but might push Alice into accepting, especially as she has shown some flexibility.  This strategy uses the pressure of limited rounds to potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's not ideal, accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product without exceeding his limit.  He has only 3 rounds left, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a worse outcome.  Accepting ensures he gets the product at a price that is acceptable, albeit slightly higher than he hoped for."
