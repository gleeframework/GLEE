"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to discuss the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What are your thoughts on this?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a significant gap from what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive offer, considering its potential and unique value proposition.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still feel that the price is too high. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market conditions and the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts on this?",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
