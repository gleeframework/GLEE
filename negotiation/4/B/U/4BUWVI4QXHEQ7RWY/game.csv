"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,500. This price still leaves some room for profit for me and it's closer to what I value the product at.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $15,500 is still a bit more than I want to spend.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy.",15000.0,Bob,4,
