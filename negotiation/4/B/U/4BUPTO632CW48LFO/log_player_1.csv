Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum value:**  You're asking for more than your minimum, aiming to maximize your profits.
* **It's not too high:** You don't want to scare Bob off with an outrageous price right away.

Keep in mind that this is just an initial offer.  You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and how much you believe the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price. You can use the information from his message to inform your next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand you're working within a budget. While $100 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about $125?  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal, and while I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $110 for the product? This would allow me to purchase it without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation with Bob will only lead to more back and forth.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum desired price of $120, which is a more secure and efficient option."
