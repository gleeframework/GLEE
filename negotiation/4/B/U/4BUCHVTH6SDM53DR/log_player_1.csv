{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum but leaves room for potential bargaining.  I chose $1,300,000 because:

* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's a significant markup from your minimum but still within a range that might be acceptable to Bob.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you have room to adjust the price down without compromising your minimum. 
* **It highlights the value:** Stating the price upfront establishes the product's worth. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings, but also be prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low or the negotiation becomes too time-consuming."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it doesn't leave any room for profit.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher.  We'll send a counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $1,200,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a small profit while still being within your budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 
This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You're not holding out for your original price but offering a reduction.
* **Offers a clear reason:** You justify the price by stating it allows for a small profit, which aligns with your goals.
* **Maintains the negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the conversation going and increases the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to pay $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1225000 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum,  it's still not ideal. There's a good chance you could get a higher price from John if this negotiation continues to drag on. Let's see if we can get Bob to move a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll accept $1,237,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my desire to work with you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1237500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows compromise:**  It's a clear compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and your previous one.
* **Reinforces value:** It subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth.
* **Creates urgency:** By focusing on ""working with you"" it subtly implies that if Bob doesn't accept, you might be more inclined to sell to John."

It's time to cut our losses. Bob has been firm on his price, and we're at a stalemate. We've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely that Bob will budge further. Since we can secure our minimum price of $1,200,000 from John, it's more efficient to move forward with the sale to him."
