"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000.  I believe this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a significantly higher price ($2,300,000) than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confidence:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, justifying the high asking price. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, the message implies a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is far below both my minimum and his own stated valuation.  This suggests he's either:

* **Not serious:**  The lowball offer could be a tactic to see how desperate I am to sell.
* **Underestimating:** Bob might be trying to undervalue the product, hoping I'm unaware of its true worth. 

It's too early to sell to John. I'll counteroffer and try to bring the negotiation closer to a realistic price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. How about $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** I'm politely explaining why Bob's initial offer was unacceptable, emphasizing the disparity between his offer and the product's value.
* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:** I've reduced my asking price by $300,000, demonstrating flexibility while remaining well above my minimum and closer to Bob's stated valuation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's seriousness and willingness to engage in a meaningful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still substantially below his own valuation of the product.  There's room for negotiation. Here's why I'm rejecting and countering:

* **Strategic Bargaining:**  Accepting now would leave a significant amount of money on the table. Bob's mention of a ""budget"" could be a negotiation tactic.
* **Aiming Higher:** My goal is to close a deal as close to $1,500,000 as possible, and I believe there's a reasonable chance of achieving that with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to make a deal happen."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I'm recognizing Bob's movement towards a more reasonable price, which helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Significant Concession:** I've made a substantial drop in my asking price ($250,000), demonstrating serious intent to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Positioning:** This counteroffer still provides a buffer above my minimum, allowing for potential concessions in later rounds while keeping the pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a tough negotiation, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob is still incrementing his offers in relatively small amounts. This suggests there's more room for him to move. Here's why I'm rejecting and countering:

* **Maintaining Pressure:**  Accepting at $1,350,000 would be leaving a significant portion of potential profit on the table. By continuing to negotiate, I maintain pressure on Bob to improve his offer.
* **Confidence in Value:** My willingness to reject his offer reinforces the idea that the product is truly valuable and I'm not desperate to sell it at any price. 
* **Deadline Awareness:** We are getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Bob might be more willing to concede as we get closer to the end."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, at this point I need to see a more significant move to reach a deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my bottom line."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm setting a firm stance by stating my ""bottom line,"" creating a sense of urgency. However, the offer is still fair, leaving room for a small concession from Bob to close the deal.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm not just stating a number; I'm emphasizing that this is a significant step for me, implying the value of the deal. 
* **Shifting Pressure:**  By putting my final offer on the table, I shift the pressure to Bob to either accept a reasonable price or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me.  I can offer $1,425,000 - this is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:**  While not ideal, $1,425,000 is reasonably close to my $1,500,000 goal and significantly above my minimum. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer. Pushing further might lead to him walking away.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  We're down to the last few rounds.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob not reaching an acceptable price before time runs out.

It's a tough call, but taking the sure thing at this point seems like the most strategic move."
