Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer stands as a testament to my desire to see it in your capable hands."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a profit above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the offer as beneficial to Bob, potentially increasing his willingness to accept.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines."
