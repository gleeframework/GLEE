"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $150, hoping to get as much as possible from Bob. This is a high initial offer, but I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than my minimum value of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for a price that low this early in the process. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still above my minimum value and closer to the middle ground between our valuations. This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also sets a clear lower limit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for that low, even though I'm in the middle of negotiations. It's better to keep pushing for a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, showing flexibility, but still staying above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, while still securing a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value and we are already halfway through the rounds. I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $150 by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further potential negotiation headaches."
