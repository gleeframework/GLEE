It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $85 is a good starting point, but I can likely get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to come down."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down a bit, and $80 is a reasonable price for the product.  It's better than what John is offering, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal from Alice."
