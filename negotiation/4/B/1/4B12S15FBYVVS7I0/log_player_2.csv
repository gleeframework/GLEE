"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation of the product. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone helps keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Justification:** While not essential, hinting at your budget can sometimes encourage the seller to move closer to your range. 

It's important to note that this is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate further and potentially increase your offer if Alice is unwilling to go this low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, $12,000 is still above your maximum budget and her own valuation of the product. There's room for further negotiation. Let's see if we can nudge her closer to the $10,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $12,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm eager to make a deal, and I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** By offering $9,500, we're showing willingness to move closer to Alice's price but in smaller increments. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Expressing eagerness to close the deal might encourage Alice to accept, especially if she's motivated to sell.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** It's important to stay below John's $10,000 offer to ensure we're getting a better deal if Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now at $11,000, and while she says that's her ""final offer,"" it's still above your maximum budget and John's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price."
