(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can potentially get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  You have a significant difference between your maximum value and Alice's minimum value, making further negotiation worthwhile."

Alice's offer is still higher than what you are willing to pay. Even though she offered a compromise, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer could potentially lead to a price closer to your target."
