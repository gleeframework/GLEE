Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The price range where a deal can happen is between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer. You can aim high, knowing you have John as a safety net. However, pushing Bob too close to his maximum might make him walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting significantly above Bob's perceived value, signaling the product's worth.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates urgency for Bob to decide.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While you're aiming high, the $100,000 difference between your offer and your guaranteed price leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
