"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
