"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  However, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but the $600,000 offer is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This reflects the unique advantages it offers and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to make a substantial move to bridge this gap, but I need to see some flexibility from your side as well.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This price reflects the true value and potential of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
