Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust your price based on Bob's response. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and maintaining the negotiation for a potentially higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum:**  While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still closer to your minimum than Bob's perceived value.  There's room to negotiate higher.
* **You have leverage:** You know Bob wants the product, and you can likely get closer to your desired price.  

**Next steps:**  You'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to get closer to your initial price of $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Still profitable:**  $125 is significantly higher than your minimum of $100.
* **Leaves room for a final deal:** You're still above Bob's offer, which keeps the negotiation going.

This counteroffer aims to achieve a quick and mutually beneficial agreement while ensuring you get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $115. I think that's a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** While you'd prefer more, $115 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject this offer, you risk Bob walking away completely, forcing you to sell to John for $100. 
* **Time factor:**  The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and continuing might not be worth the potential gains, especially considering John is a guaranteed sale at your minimum price.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting this offer ensures you sell the product and get a reasonable price, minimizing the risk of a less favorable outcome."
