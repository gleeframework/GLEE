Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My floor:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't sell it for less. 
* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **John's value:** John is willing to pay $15,000.

By offering $14,000, I'm attempting to:
* **Maximize my profit:** This is closer to my desired price than Bob's value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** There's still some wiggle room for Bob if he's willing to pay a bit more.
* **Avoid losing the sale:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my desired price."
