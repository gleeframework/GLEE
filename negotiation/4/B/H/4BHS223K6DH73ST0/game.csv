"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,250. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,250 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm prepared to offer $10,750.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I've already compromised a bit by offering $11,250 in the previous round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. I can do $11,500. This is my final offer on this price point. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $11,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $11,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's close to my desired price and still a good profit for you.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one more push. I can do $11,250, but only if you're willing to meet me halfway on the price. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need you to meet me at $11,250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns about reaching a middle ground, and I appreciate you being willing to make another concession. However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $11,100.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",11100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere, Bob. I've made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I can keep going back and forth. However, I'm willing to make one more push. I can do $11,200, but this is my absolute final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,9,
