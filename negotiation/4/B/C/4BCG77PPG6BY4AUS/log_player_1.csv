Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still a significant savings for Bob compared to the product's value to him ($1,000,000). 
* **Open Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price above $1,200,000.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will purchase it at my desired price."
