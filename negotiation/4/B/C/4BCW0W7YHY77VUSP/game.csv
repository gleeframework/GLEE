"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a little too low for me. How about $1,087,500?  That's closer to what I need, and I think it's still a good deal for you.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,087,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
