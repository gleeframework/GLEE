Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this opportunity.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to recoup my investment while giving you a substantial discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that be workable for you?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't cover the investment I've made in this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,175,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good deal and me to recover my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to reach a fair middle ground.  $1,175,000 is a reasonable compromise, well below your maximum budget, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome."
