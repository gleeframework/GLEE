"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this opportunity.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to recoup my investment while giving you a substantial discount.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that be workable for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't cover the investment I've made in this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,175,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good deal and me to recover my investment.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
