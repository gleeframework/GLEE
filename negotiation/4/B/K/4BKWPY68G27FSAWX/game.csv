"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see the value of this product to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $950,000. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go below $950,000. Let's try $920,000. It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,5,
