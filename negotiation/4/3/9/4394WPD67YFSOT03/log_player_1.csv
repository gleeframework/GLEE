Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, so you have leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's appealing to Bob (meaning it's less than his perceived value) but maximizes your profit. Aiming slightly below his maximum value increases your chances of a successful deal.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I've carefully assessed its value, and given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this price represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's framed positively, highlighting the product's value and your careful consideration of the price.
* **The Price:**  $1,150,000  leaves a $50,000 buffer from Bob's maximum value, making it likely he'll see it as a good deal. It also nets you a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed sale to John. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer. You could adjust it slightly higher or lower depending on your risk tolerance and how confident you feel in Bob's willingness to pay."
