Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit. This will likely be rejected, but it allows me to gauge Bob's interest and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than my floor price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,000,000.  This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I hope this will encourage him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $950,000 is a good compromise and a significant profit.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Bob walking away or me needing to sell to John for a lower price."
