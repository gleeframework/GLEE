"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'd like to propose a price of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'd be willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still not quite where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle again and settle at $10,000? I'm willing to do this to finalize a deal today.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've already made a counteroffer of $9,750 and you've rejected it. I'm not willing to go back to $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but I need you to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options",9750.0,Bob,8,
