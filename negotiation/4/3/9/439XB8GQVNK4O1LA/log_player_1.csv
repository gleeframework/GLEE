"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By starting at $12,000, there's a potential for Bob to counter with a lower price, while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Establishing a baseline:** This sets the starting point for the negotiation and demonstrates my expectation of a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $9,000 is significantly below my desired profit margin. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have 10 rounds to reach an agreement, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not desperate to sell at his price and that I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $10,500 is still well above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I'm highlighting the value the product brings to Bob, reinforcing the potential benefit of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'd like to propose a price of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable offer. 
* **More room for negotiation:**  We still have 6 rounds left, which gives me the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my commitment to achieving a price that reflects the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:**  I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and reach a fair agreement.
* **Increased pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing the mutual satisfaction of a deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'd be willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better offer:** We have 4 rounds left.  There's still potential to negotiate a higher price, especially as Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my commitment to getting a better price and my confidence that I can achieve it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still not quite where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle again and settle at $10,000? I'm willing to do this to finalize a deal today.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterate compromise:** By suggesting the middle ground again, I'm showing a continued willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Time pressure:**  With only 3 rounds left, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to reach an agreement.
* **Incentivize closing:** I'm emphasizing a desire to finalize the deal today, adding a sense of urgency and potentially making Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already made a counteroffer of $9,750 and you've rejected it. I'm not willing to go back to $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but I need you to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds remaining, the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob is diminishing.
* **Bob's stubbornness:** Bob is not showing any willingness to increase his offer further, even with the limited time remaining.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than anything Bob is offering.  

While I'd prefer to make a profit closer to my ideal price, the risk of not closing the deal with Bob and losing the opportunity to sell to John outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
