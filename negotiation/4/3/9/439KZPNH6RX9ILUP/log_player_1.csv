{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that you value the product and are not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$70 is below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $78? That's a decent compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum. While I could counteroffer again, the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection is not worth it.  I'd rather sell to John for $80 and avoid the hassle."
