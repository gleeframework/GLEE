Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below my target price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a better deal. I'm confident that I can persuade Bob to pay a higher price, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but it's not clear if he'll go any higher. I've only got 4 rounds left, and it's risky to keep negotiating with Bob. I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
