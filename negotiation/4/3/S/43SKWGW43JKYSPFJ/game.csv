"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm willing to wait for the right buyer if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
