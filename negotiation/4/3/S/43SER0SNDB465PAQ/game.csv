"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What do you think?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $2,250,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,950,000. This is a more than fair offer considering the potential return on investment.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,950,000 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
