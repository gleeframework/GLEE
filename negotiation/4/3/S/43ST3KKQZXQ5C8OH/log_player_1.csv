"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and gauge his initial reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I don't want to settle too quickly.  I'm going to try and get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counter offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting more aggressive, but I'm still not willing to settle for $14,000.  I'm going to counter again, but this time I'll offer $16,000.  I'm getting closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm offering $16,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal with Bob before I risk losing him to another buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I've already made several concessions and am getting close to my minimum price.  However, I'm starting to run out of time and the risk of further negotiation is too high. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
