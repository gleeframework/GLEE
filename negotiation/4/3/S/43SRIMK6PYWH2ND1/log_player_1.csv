{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling for anything above $1,200,000 (John's offer) is a win for Alice."
