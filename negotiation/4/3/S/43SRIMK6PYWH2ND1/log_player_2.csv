"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above her valuation, it's still less than your maximum price of $1,500,000 and better than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to John's price."
