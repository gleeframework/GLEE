"I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $14,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
