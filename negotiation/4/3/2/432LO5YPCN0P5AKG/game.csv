"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $15000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $9000. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000, and I'm making a serious commitment to purchase it. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $12500. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more counteroffer, but $12500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,6,
