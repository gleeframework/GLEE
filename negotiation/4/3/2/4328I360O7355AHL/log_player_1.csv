I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a significant profit.  I believe this is a good starting point, but I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the potential of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still a good amount for me.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will find it acceptable. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to consider selling to John, but I'm still optimistic about reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still not enough. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $1,000,000, which is a better deal than accepting Bob's latest offer.  I'm choosing to sell to John to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000."
