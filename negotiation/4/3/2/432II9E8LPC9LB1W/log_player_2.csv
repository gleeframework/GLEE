Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $720,000. This is the best I can do without losing money on the deal. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make it work. What do you think?

It seems like we've reached a stalemate.  Alice is unlikely to go below $720,000, and while I could counter again, there's a risk she'll hold firm or I'll waste more time haggling.  It's a decent price compared to John's offer, so I'll accept."
