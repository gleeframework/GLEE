"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product to me. However, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. Would you be willing to consider $850,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the product's worth to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I have to consider my own minimum requirements. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'd hoped for. Would you be willing to meet me at $875,000? This would split the difference between our last offers and allow for a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to keep the conversation going. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",900000.0,Alice,5,
