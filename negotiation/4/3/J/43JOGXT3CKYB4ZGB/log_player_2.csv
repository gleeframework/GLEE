"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation and shows I'm serious about buying the product at a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways away from a price I'm happy with. It's worth seeing if she'll move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $95? That's a fair offer, considering the value I place on it."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Show progress:** We're increasing our offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate and move closer to a deal.
* **Stay below budget:**  The offer is still well within the $100 budget, leaving some room for a potential final compromise. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the offer (""fair offer, considering the value..."") can make Alice more receptive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than what I'd like to get for the product. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting close, but Alice is still significantly above my budget. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our prices is still too wide. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, but I also have the option to buy it elsewhere for that price. If you're not able to meet me at $100, I'll have to consider that alternative."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Final offer:**  This is my final offer, matching John's price. 
* **Introduce competition:** By mentioning the alternative, we create urgency and a reason for Alice to seriously consider our offer.
* **Polite but firm:**  The tone remains respectful while making it clear that this is my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you have other options, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $120. It's clear she's trying to meet me ""halfway,"" but that still puts the price above my budget and John's offer.  I've been firm with my $100 limit, and it's time to walk away and take advantage of the guaranteed good deal with John."
