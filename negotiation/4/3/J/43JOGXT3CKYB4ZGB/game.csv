"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $95? That's a fair offer, considering the value I place on it.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than what I'd like to get for the product. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our prices is still too wide. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, but I also have the option to buy it elsewhere for that price. If you're not able to meet me at $100, I'll have to consider that alternative.",100.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you have other options, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,7,
