"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is based on the fact that I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, we'll adjust the price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that immediately. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm confident that I can get more than $8,000, especially since I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a decent profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me. If he rejects again, we'll need to negotiate further, but I'm confident I can secure a good price within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting late in the game. It's  better to secure a profit of $500 than risk getting nothing if Bob rejects my next counteroffer and I'm forced to sell to John for $8,000."
