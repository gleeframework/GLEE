"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product, valued at $12,000 to you, Bob. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John if necessary. There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
