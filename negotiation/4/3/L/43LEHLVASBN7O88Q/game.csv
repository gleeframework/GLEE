"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to do $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $115 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a great deal for you, and it's close to my bottom line.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $122?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",122.0,Bob,4,
