"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us. ",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,750, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $8,250.  This price is closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable profit.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $8,250. How about we meet at $7,500 again, but I'll throw in an additional $100 to sweeten the deal? That way, we can both benefit from the sale.",6600.0,Bob,6,
