"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his budget as possible.  Offering $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. He wants to continue negotiating with Alice to try and reach a price closer to $800,000. There are still rounds left, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if he doesn't get a better offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of trying to get as close to $800,000 as possible. By offering $875,000, he's demonstrating his willingness to negotiate, but also showing that he's not willing to go much higher. He's hoping that Alice will be willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still holding out for a higher price.  While $925,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he's still holding firm to get a price as close to $800,000 as possible. He's willing to continue negotiating with Alice, as he has more rounds left and can always opt to buy from John if a deal with Alice isn't reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to stay persistent and show Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal.  By offering $880,000, he's only slightly increasing his offer, while still staying within his budget. This indicates to Alice that he's willing to compromise, but also that he won't budge much further. He hopes that Alice will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  He wants to continue negotiating to see if he can push Alice further.  There are still a few rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John if a better deal with Alice isn't reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the deal and get the best possible price. He's slightly increased his offer from the previous round to show Alice that he's willing to be flexible but he's not going to go much higher. He hopes that Alice will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer. He's also mindful of the fact that time is running out and he can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $905,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $905,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not willing to meet Bob's target price. With only one round remaining, Bob's chances of negotiating a better price are slim.  He's already been through several rounds of negotiation and has come close to his budget, but not quite there. Rather than risk getting stuck with a deal that's above his limit, Bob decides it's more prudent to buy the product from John for his target price of $800,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of a last-minute deal with Alice that could be unfavorable."
