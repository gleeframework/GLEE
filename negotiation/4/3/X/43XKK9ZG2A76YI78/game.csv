"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not ready to let go of the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the market price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
