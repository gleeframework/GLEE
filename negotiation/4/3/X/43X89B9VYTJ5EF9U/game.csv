"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings to you, and it's a good starting point for us to find common ground.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can we do $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
