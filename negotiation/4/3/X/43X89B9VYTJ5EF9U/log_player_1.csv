"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Highlighting value:**  I mention the product's value to Bob to emphasize the potential gain he'll get by buying it.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I end with an invitation for Bob to respond, making it clear I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and there's still room to negotiate further.
* **Higher potential:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000 by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 
* **Potential to meet in the middle:**  Bob is already willing to pay a significant amount, and a counteroffer might lead to a mutually agreeable price. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings to you, and it's a good starting point for us to find common ground.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob to reinforce the justification for the price.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can we do $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will become less willing to negotiate, and we might end up with a lower final price.
* **Time constraint:** With 10 rounds remaining, I need to be mindful of the time limit and the possibility that I might not reach a higher price with Bob.

While $925,000 is not my ideal price, it's a good compromise considering the potential risk of further negotiation."
