"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to us both. This product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and I am excited to offer it to you at a special price tailored to reflect its true worth and your appreciation for it. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This offer not only ensures that you secure this valuable asset at a premium but also allows me to maximize the return on this unique item. I look forward to discussing the details further and hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she claims the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, I know my upper limit is $1,200,000.  By rejecting her offer, I can see if she'll come down further.  If not, I can always buy from John at my maximum price."
