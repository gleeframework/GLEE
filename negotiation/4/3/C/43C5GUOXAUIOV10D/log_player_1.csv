Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's a fair starting point to gauge Bob's interest. 

I'm confident that I can negotiate further if he counters, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to avoid selling to John at the minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for $8,000. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $12,000. This is my absolute minimum, as it's the same price I can get from John. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm not willing to negotiate further, so I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
