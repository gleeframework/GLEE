Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you know the product is worth $100 to Bob, aiming for a price close to that maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
