"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  The product looks promising, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think that's a fair price.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,200. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,300. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11300.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,300 is closer, but to make this work on my end, I need to be at $11,000.  Let me know if that's doable for you.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,400. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,350.
