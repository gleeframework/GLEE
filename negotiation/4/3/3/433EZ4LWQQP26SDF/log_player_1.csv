Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth at least $10,000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $500 gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value allows for a comfortable negotiation range. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value. This will allow for further negotiation and potentially lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, Thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9,250?  That's still a good deal for both of us, right? Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm counteroffering with a price that is closer to my desired value but still acknowledges Bob's position. This keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Compromise & Fairness:** I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This demonstrates willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,250. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a loss.
* **Selling to John is Safe:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would guarantee my desired outcome and avoid any further negotiation with Bob.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There is a risk that further negotiation with Bob could lead to a stalemate or a lower price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I also recognize the value of a guaranteed sale.

**However, I will make one more counteroffer to Bob before considering selling to John. I want to see if there's any possibility of reaching an agreement with Bob without accepting a loss.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position,  $8,800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,000, which is a good compromise.  If you're serious about buying this product, let's make this deal happen! Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final compromise, representing a significant concession from my previous offer but still remaining above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Urgency & Finality:** The message emphasizes the need for a decision and portrays this as a final offer,  increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to maintain a constructive negotiation environment. 

**If Bob rejects this offer, I will proceed with selling the product to John for $10,000. The risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high, as it could lead to a lower price or a stalemate.**"
