"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its features and benefits, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to secure a good deal. It's also a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise without going too low too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can still try to get a better deal. Alice is already willing to negotiate, so there's a chance she'll come down further.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal. He's increased his offer slightly, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway, but he's still pushing for a lower price. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving while showing Bob is determined to get the best price possible."
