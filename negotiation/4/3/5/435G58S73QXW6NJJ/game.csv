"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit steep for my current budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go, I'm willing to meet you at $975000. This offer is close to your counteroffer, and I think it reflects the value of the product fairly. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $975000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. I'm offering the product to you for $1025000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1025000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your last offer and the value we both recognize in this product. I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1000000, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1075000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
