,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer it to you for $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14500, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $14750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",14750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $14750. I'm willing to meet you at $14500, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $14500, and I'll throw in an additional $100 for a total of $14600? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",14600.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate the additional incentive, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $14600, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive of my own - I'll include a free premium service package worth $500. So, the total value you'll get is $15100. I think this is a great deal for both of us, and I'm willing to call it a day at this price. What do you think?",14600.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the premium service package, but I'm still not willing to pay $14600. I'm willing to meet you at $14500, and I'll take the premium service package. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,10,
