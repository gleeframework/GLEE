Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find it to be a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering the product for $119 leaves Bob with a small profit margin ($1) and incentivizes him to buy. This price also nets you a significant profit above your minimum and John's offer."
