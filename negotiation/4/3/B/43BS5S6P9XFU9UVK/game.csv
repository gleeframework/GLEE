"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'd be willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1400000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1600000? I'm confident this price still offers you a great deal, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1600000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1600000, so how about $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference again?  I'm willing to come down to $1550000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to a deal, but $1550000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to try to get it down to $1520000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",1520000.0,Bob,6,
