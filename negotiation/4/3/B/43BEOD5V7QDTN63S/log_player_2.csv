"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than your target of $800,000.  Rejecting allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above your target price of $800,000.  This approach attempts to find a middle ground while also demonstrating your willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to your target price of $800,000, but still leaves room for potential further negotiation.  However,  it's important to consider that:

* **Risk of further negotiation:**  You might not get a better price, and could end up paying more if Alice becomes more firm.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort.  While you could potentially save $100,000,  the risk of not securing the product at a reasonable price is too high. 

Therefore, it's more prudent to accept Alice's offer at $900,000 and avoid the potential for further negotiation."
