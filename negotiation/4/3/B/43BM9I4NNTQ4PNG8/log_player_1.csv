Round 2

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly,  $950,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great price for the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite enough. I'm going to hold out for a better offer in the next round.  I still have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I can afford to be patient."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still too far below my bottom line.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,012,500.
