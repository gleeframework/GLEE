"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your guns. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,
