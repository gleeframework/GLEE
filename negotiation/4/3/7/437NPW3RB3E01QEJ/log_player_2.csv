"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there is room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

You're still willing to pay more than Alice's minimum, but there's room to negotiate a bit lower.  Let's try to get closer to your target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction quickly.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
