"Alice, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for your product. This reflects the value I see in it and offers a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is simply too low. I understand you have a budget, but this product is worth significantly more. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1750000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and reflects a reasonable compromise for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1750000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1250000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1250000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1600000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and provides us both with a reasonable deal. Let's find common ground and make this happen.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $1600000 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1250000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope we can reach a conclusion soon.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
