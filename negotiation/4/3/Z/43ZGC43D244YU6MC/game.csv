"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $75? I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than that.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's try $80.  That's my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
