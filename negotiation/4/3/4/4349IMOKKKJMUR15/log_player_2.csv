"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring counteroffers to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, and I believe that's a fair price considering my maximum spending limit."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above it. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $1,025,000? This would be a good compromise, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $1,030,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been diligently negotiating with Alice, but it seems she's unwilling to go below $1,030,000.  While this is closer to his budget, it's still a bit higher than his maximum limit.  Given the option to purchase from John for $1,000,000, Bob should take advantage of this opportunity to save an additional $30,000."
