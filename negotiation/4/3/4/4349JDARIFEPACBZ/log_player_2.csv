"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above my desired price. I want to try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I can only go down to $13,500. If you're serious about buying, this is my final offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $13,500 is still within my budget and is a better price than John's offer of $15,000.  It's also closer to my desired price than my last counteroffer. It's worth accepting this offer to get the product."
