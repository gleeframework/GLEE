``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's a fair price that's lower than the product's value to him ($150), but still higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
