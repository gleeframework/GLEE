Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to potentially earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $119 is just below my guaranteed sale price. This makes the offer attractive to Bob while still securing a significant profit for me if he accepts.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  By mentioning a ""limited time,"" I create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
