Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our initial positions. I hope this aligns better with your budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's goal, but it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. I've considered your offer carefully and am willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $887,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you place on it and the value it holds for me. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating,  accepting this offer is a good compromise.  It saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable price considering Alice's minimum value for the product."
