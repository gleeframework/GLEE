(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still outside your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price.  There's still room for a counteroffer before you have to consider John's offer."

You are getting closer to your budget, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  This counteroffer is a significant step towards your goal of buying the product at a price that works for you."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and while you could try another counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll accept. It's better to secure the product from John at a price that's within your budget and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
