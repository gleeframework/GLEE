Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $16,000 is a solid deal. It surpasses his initial valuation and provides a significant profit over John's offer."
