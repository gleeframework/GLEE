"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1500000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1100000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.**  
* **You can buy the product from John for $1,500,000**, which is still within your budget and better than Alice's offer.

While rejecting Alice's offer might seem like a loss, it's strategically the better choice in this scenario as you can secure the product for a lower price with John."
