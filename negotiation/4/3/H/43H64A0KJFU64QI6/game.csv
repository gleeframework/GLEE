"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my minimum.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That way, we can both be happy.",10000.0,Bob,4,
