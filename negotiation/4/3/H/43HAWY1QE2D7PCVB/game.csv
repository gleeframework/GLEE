"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $900000 is a good start, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about $950000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the deal with you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $940000? This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to accept your offer while still ensuring I get a fair price for my product.",940000.0,Alice,5,
