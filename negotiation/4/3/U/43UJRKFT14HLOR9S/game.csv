"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your life.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, though, and I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. This is the absolute maximum I can afford at the moment.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that I can find a similar product for a lower price elsewhere. However, I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but this is my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
