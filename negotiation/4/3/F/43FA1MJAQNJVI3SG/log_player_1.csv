``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a starting point, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $80 while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $85. This is a compromise between his offer and my minimum desired price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. While Bob's offer of $78 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $80, I'm not going to risk further negotiation with Bob."
