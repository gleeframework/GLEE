Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves him room for a ""good deal"" feeling. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy balances securing a deal with maximizing the potential profit from the sale."
