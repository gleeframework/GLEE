"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a good compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $9,300. This is really my absolute bottom line, as I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",9300.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $9,300 is your bottom line, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $9,150. This is the absolute maximum I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",9150.0,Bob,6,
