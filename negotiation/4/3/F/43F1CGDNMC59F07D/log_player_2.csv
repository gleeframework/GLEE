{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting further away from Bob's target price, and he's running out of time. With only 3 rounds left, Bob realizes it's becoming increasingly unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a price lower than $10,200.  He's better off buying from John at $12,000, as this is still within his budget, and he avoids the risk of being unable to secure the product at all."
