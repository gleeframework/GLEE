"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which still gives you a great deal. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't come closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still not a price I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're willing to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a price closer to $10,000, but I'm starting to get a bit nervous that Bob might not be willing to go that high. I'll make one more counteroffer, but if he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,400.  This is my final offer - if you're not willing to go this high, I'll have to sell to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9400}
