Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he won't pay more than that.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The price range where a deal can happen is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still staying within a realistic range for Bob.  

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting high gives you room to negotiate and signals the product's value.
* **Within Reason:** While above Bob's valuation, the price is within the ZOPA, making it a potential deal if he's motivated. 
* **Alternative Implied:** By not mentioning John, you subtly convey you have other options, strengthening your position.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive starting point might be preferable.
 
Remember, this is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response!"
