Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $10,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at $15,000.  Starting with a high offer of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, Alice can still likely negotiate a price higher than $15,000. This strategy maximizes her potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language to emphasize the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Alice could choose different approaches depending on her negotiation style and how much she wants to prioritize a deal with Bob over a guaranteed sale to John."
