# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it would be highly valuable to your business. My initial offer is $900,000.  This price reflects the product's true worth and potential for growth. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to compromise. I propose a price of $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That would be a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $740,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my minimum price. This reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer of $740,000 is a good deal. It's below your maximum budget and significantly less than John's offer. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better price and risks Alice withdrawing the offer altogether."
