"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $140. I think it would be perfect for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $140 is close to your maximum budget but still leaves room for negotiation. You might be able to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:** Offering $110 is a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but it's still above her perceived value of the product ($120). This leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:**  The message is framed in a way that shows you're interested but want a fairer price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original price.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to her value of $120, but still saves you $25 compared to John's offer. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
