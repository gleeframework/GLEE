"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
