Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for negotiation without immediately hitting my minimum threshold. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to incentivize him to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject based on my minimum acceptable price and the potential for further negotiation. I'll also keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to go down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point and see if Bob is willing to compromise.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer of $12,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet. There's a chance I can secure a better deal with Bob through further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer of $8,000 and my desired price point. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, hoping to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  I've left some room for further negotiation in case Bob still wants to negotiate further. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm still keeping John's offer of $12,000 in mind as a backup option.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer. I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm also ready to accept John's offer if Bob continues to reject my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That seems like a fair compromise given where we both are. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a smaller profit, but it's still a decent outcome.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While $9,000 is close to my limit, there's still a possibility that I could negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round. However, the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and walking away is also high.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially take more time, and I might ultimately end up accepting John's offer of $12,000 anyway.  It's better to lock in a guaranteed $9,000 now and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and proceed with the sale. I'll be happy with the outcome, but I'll also keep an eye out for other potential buyers in the future who might be willing to pay closer to my desired price."
