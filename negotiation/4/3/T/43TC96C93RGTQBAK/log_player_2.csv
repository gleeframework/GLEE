"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $110. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is only $10 less than what you're willing to pay from John.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $100.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $105, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $105, which is $15 less than what you'd pay from John. This is a good deal for you, considering you were hoping to pay around $100.  There's always a chance you could get a slightly better price, but it's risky to keep negotiating with the risk of Alice walking away or you running out of rounds."
