"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. My goal is to see how high he's willing to go, and to establish a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000, my minimum acceptable price. This signals that I'm serious about getting this price, while also leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure,  I'm still holding out for a better price.  $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can get him to increase it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,400,000.  I believe this is still a fair price, given the value of the product to both of us.  I'm hoping that by showing flexibility, I can get Bob to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a better price from Bob, it's clear that he's unwilling to meet my minimum price.  I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation with Bob, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John."
