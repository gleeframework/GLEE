Explanation:  

Bob has made it clear he won't go much higher. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better offer than his last one ($1,225,000). John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000.  At this point, the certainty of selling to John for $1,200,000 outweighs the potential for slightly more profit from Bob."
