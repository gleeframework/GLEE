"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it can offer you.  I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to come down to $1,100,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,400,000.  This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on your price, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need a price that works for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000, but that's really my absolute lowest point.  I believe this still represents a great deal for you, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I can agree to.  How about we settle on $1,225,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value will be worth it.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you almost halfway.  How about we settle on $1,275,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a good profit while still giving you a great deal on the product.  Let's close this deal!",1275000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to look at other options. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,9,
