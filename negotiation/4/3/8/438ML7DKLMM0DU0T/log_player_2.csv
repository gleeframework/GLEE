Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer, and I'm not willing to sell to John for $800,000. I'm going to have to stand firm at $795,000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid we won't be able to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $795,000. While you could continue negotiating, you risk her sticking to her price and you losing out on a better deal. Buying from John would cost you $1,000,000, a significantly worse outcome than accepting Alice's offer. 

At this point, accepting the $795,000 offer represents a good balance between getting a fair price and securing the deal."
