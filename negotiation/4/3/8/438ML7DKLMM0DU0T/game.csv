"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer, and I'm not willing to sell to John for $800,000. I'm going to have to stand firm at $795,000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid we won't be able to come to an agreement.",795000.0,Alice,7,,
