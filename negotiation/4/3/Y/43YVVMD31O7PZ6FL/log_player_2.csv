Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is far above his budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $13,000?

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."
