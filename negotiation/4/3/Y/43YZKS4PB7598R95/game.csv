"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",10500.0,Bob,4,
