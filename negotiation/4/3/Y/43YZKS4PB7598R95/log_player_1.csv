{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's worth it considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is too low for me, especially since the product is worth $10,000 to me. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'll take it."
