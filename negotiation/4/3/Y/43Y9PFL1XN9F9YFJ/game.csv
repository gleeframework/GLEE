"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $22,000 is far too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $19,000. This is a serious offer, and I think it reflects the value this product will bring you.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $19,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This offer stands as a sign of good faith, but I'm afraid I can't go any lower.",16000.0,Alice,5,
