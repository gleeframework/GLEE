"I'm interested in the product, but I think $17,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $15,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? That's the best I can do.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $14,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",14250.0,Alice,5,
