"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount, and I'm confident it could be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a price that reflects the potential value of the product, but also leaves room for negotiation.  I understand this is a substantial investment, so I encourage you to ask any questions you may have. If you're not interested at this price, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $1000000. So, the choice is yours.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
