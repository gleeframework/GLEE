# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think this is a great deal, and I'm open to negotiating further if you're interested. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
