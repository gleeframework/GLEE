"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset for you.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is still a tough pill to swallow. How about we compromise at $14,000? This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,6,
