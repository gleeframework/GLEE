"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

Reasoning: Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much better final price. Offering $600,000 is still a significant sum, showing serious interest while aiming for a substantial discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning: Alice is moving towards a more agreeable price, but we still have room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a price closer to our initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we possibly settle on $650,000? That would be a comfortable price point for me."", 
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

Reasoning:  We are moving closer to a potential agreement.  This counteroffer:

* **Acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate.**
* **Reiterates our budget constraints (even if somewhat exaggerated) to encourage a lower price.** 
* **Offers a specific price that is a reasonable increment from our previous offer.**

We're aiming for a price that benefits both parties, but we're also mindful of our alternative option (buying from John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $700,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:  Alice has signaled this is her final concession, and the price of $700,000 represents a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,000,000. Continuing to negotiate at this point risks losing the deal altogether, and $700,000 is a reasonable price for both parties."
