"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $750,000?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we possibly settle on $650,000? That would be a comfortable price point for me.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $700,000?",700000.0,Alice,5,
