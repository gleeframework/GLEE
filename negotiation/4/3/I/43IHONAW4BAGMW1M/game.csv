"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $105 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a good deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my means.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $108 just doesn't quite work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is my final offer, I really don't want to lose out on this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $110, which would be $109. Would you be willing to consider this?",109.0,Bob,6,
