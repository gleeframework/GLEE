Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll be prepared to counter his offers and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than $1,500,000. I will counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This should encourage Bob to continue negotiating while ensuring I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
