"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower.  I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it.  This is the highest I'm able to go at this time.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
