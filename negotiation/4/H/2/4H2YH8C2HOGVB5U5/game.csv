"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which is worth a great deal to me, for $1000000. This is a very competitive price, but I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the value it holds.  Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $600000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and a good opportunity for you to acquire a very valuable asset.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $700000. I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $700000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $750000. This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair compromise. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $725000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",725000.0,Bob,6,
