{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but below my minimum desired value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price.
* **Offering a reason:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to create a sense of urgency and make the offer more appealing.
* **Open for negotiation:**  I'm phrasing the message in a way that encourages Bob to counter-offer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll counter-offer to try and bridge the gap, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** By offering $11,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to reiterate why my offer is fair. 
* **Seeking agreement:** The message encourages Bob to respond and hopefully reach an agreement.

This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable price point to consider while still allowing me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my ideal selling price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my desired earnings. I'll make one final counteroffer, hoping to bridge the gap, but if Bob isn't willing to come up, I'll sell to John and secure my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $12,000. This is a final offer, as I'm prepared to sell to another buyer if this doesn't work out. It's a fair price for the value of the product, and I believe it's worth considering."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This message establishes that this is my last counteroffer. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob and encourages him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value again to justify my price.
* **Alternative buyer:** Mentioning the alternative buyer (John) adds pressure and highlights that I have options. 

By offering $12,000, I'm giving Bob one last chance to make a deal that is still profitable for me, but if he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to move on and sell to John."
