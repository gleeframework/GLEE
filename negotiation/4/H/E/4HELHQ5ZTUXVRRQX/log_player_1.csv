Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for the maximum profit, but you're not being unreasonable.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows he can get it for less, but he also knows it's worth more to him than your offer. 
* **It positions you as a strong seller:** Starting high shows you're confident in the value of your product.

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000). There's room for negotiation, and I want to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm confident in the product's value. It's a strong counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving forward without being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is now only $25,000 less than my previous counteroffer.  It's a reasonable offer, and I'm confident I can make a good profit while also securing the sale.  It's not worth risking the sale to John by trying to squeeze out more from Bob at this point."
