"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $8,200 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $8,600? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",8600.0,Alice,5,
