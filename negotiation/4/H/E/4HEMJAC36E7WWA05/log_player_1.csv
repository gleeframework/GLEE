Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $8,000 floor price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob's value is $10,000, so there's a range for both of you to work with. 
* **It's a reasonable first offer:**  It doesn't start the negotiation aggressively, leaving room for a positive conversation.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a slightly higher price.  You've established that he's interested, and you can likely negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It shows flexibility:**  You're willing to lower your price from your initial offer.
* **It still leaves room for a deal:**  There's still a $500 gap between your offer and Bob's value. 
* **It reinforces your value:** You're not giving away the product too cheaply, which can make Bob value it more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, you're still within range of a better deal.  You've shown flexibility, but you need to hold firm on your value to avoid giving away too much profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $8,200 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $8,600? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 8600}
``` 
This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** You're acknowledging Bob's budget while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Offer a final compromise:** This price is close to Bob's offer and closer to your minimum, suggesting it's a final attempt at a deal.
* **Maintain your value:** You're still not giving away the product too cheaply, even though you've come down in price."
