Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering what you could gain from it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value exceeding the asking price, potentially making Bob more receptive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, but still ensures you make a significant profit even if you need to come down slightly.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while still offering Bob a chance to purchase the product."
