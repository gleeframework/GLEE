"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider $1,150,000? ",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. My next counteroffer is $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. My next counteroffer is $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good price for this valuable product.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
