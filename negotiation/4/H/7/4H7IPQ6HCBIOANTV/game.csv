"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be worth even more to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's potential for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price point.  While I agree it's a valuable product, $1,050,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. Let's try $1,025,000. This offer is a good compromise, and it allows us to both benefit from this deal.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,000,000 even? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
