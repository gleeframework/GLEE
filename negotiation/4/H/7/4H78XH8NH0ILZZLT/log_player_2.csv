# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm happy to start the price at $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is way above your budget. You're aiming to spend no more than $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to your budget, it's still above your target of $10,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a lower price.  You have more rounds to play, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can afford, and I truly believe it's a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
