Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can afford, and I truly believe it's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and doesn't seem willing to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable to me. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
