,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $65 for it. What do you think?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $80 to you. Let's try to reach an agreement. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $75 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",85.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",80.0,Bob,6,
