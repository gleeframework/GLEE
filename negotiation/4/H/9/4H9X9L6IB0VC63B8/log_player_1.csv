"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you might be interested in! I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate and how much he's willing to pay.  This sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $65 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm not willing to sell the product for $65. I will counteroffer and try to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $80 to you. Let's try to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show that I'm open to negotiating, but I'm still holding firm to a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round, but if Bob doesn't budge, I may consider selling to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $75 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm trying to stay above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that I'm being flexible and agree to this price. If not, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $80, which is my minimum acceptable value. I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
