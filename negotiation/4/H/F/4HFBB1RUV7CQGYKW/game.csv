"Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  How about $14,000? I'm serious about buying this product and this is the highest I can go. ",14000.0,Bob,4,
