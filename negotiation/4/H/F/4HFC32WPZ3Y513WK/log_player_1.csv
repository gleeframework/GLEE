Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:**  Offering it at $800,000 (your minimum) might make Bob think it's worth less or you're desperate to sell. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring the deal goes through."
