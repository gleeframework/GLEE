"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $115. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He's willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good compromise.  It's lower than her original offer and closer to Bob's preferred price of $105.  Since Bob's maximum price is $120,  accepting this offer is a good choice, saving him money compared to buying from John."
