"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a little higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'll be willing to negotiate, but I want to see where he's at first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll try to counter and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,500.  This is still above Bob's initial offer but is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle yet, and I'll try to push for a better deal.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet either, as I think I can still get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12200}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $12,200. This is a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation has stalled, and Bob is not willing to come up to my minimum price. I've already rejected his offer for $11,600, and while I could counter-offer again, I'm concerned I'll just be going back and forth without making progress.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
