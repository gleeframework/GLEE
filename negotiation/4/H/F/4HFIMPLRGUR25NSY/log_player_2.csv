"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and providing your perspective on the value. While $700,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible.  Could you consider a price point around $1,900,000?  I believe that reflects the product's true worth and opens room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're still quite far apart on the price. I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is not feasible for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a fair offer considering I have other options."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand $800,000 is your current limit, I'm confident the product's true value is significantly higher.  To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,600,000.  This reflects a considerable compromise on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate but is still far from a reasonable price.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price that makes sense for you.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, which is your maximum budget. It's better to secure the product at a price you know is acceptable than risk further negotiation with Alice."
