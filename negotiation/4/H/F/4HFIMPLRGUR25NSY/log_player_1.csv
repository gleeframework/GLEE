Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense.  How about we bring it down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While we have time, it's worth negotiating further to see if we can get closer to a price that makes sense for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and providing your perspective on the value. While $700,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible.  Could you consider a price point around $1,900,000?  I believe that reflects the product's true worth and opens room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on the price. I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is not feasible for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a fair offer considering I have other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now at his maximum valuation.  However, it's still too low to accept.  Let's see if we can get him to move from his stated limit with a counter offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand $800,000 is your current limit, I'm confident the product's true value is significantly higher.  To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,600,000.  This reflects a considerable compromise on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
