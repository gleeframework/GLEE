"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe it's a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $850000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $920000?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from your maximum offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and my previous offer of $920000. How about we settle at $910000?",910000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, but I'm not going any higher than that. Can you accept this price?",900000.0,Bob,6,
