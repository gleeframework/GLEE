"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,250,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is closer to a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
