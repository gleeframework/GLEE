"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,250,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is closer to a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is closer to his desired price, there's still a chance to negotiate further and get a lower price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
