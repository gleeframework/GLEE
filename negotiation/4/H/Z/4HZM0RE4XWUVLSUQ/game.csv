"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,400,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
