"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is my final offer for now.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap things up here.",850000.0,Alice,5,
