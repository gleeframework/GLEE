Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,075,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his goal, there's still room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $1,000,000. Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and see if he can get Alice to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're eager to close this deal, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a valuable asset. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob.  He's already made a counteroffer at that price, and while he could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal is high.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that's within his budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial price."
