"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  My price is $115. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $115 is a bit high for me. How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we split the difference at $107.50?  I'm really eager to get this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible, but $107.50 is still a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $108.75? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",108.75,Alice,5,
