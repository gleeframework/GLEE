"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,600,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, your offer is quite far from where we'd need to be. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget.  To be realistic, I can offer up to $950,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I see its potential for you. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
