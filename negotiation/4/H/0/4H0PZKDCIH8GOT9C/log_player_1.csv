"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it can make a real difference. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always wise to start negotiations higher than your absolute bottom line. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By emphasizing the product's value and potential benefits to Bob's business, we aim to frame the price as justified.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The significant difference between the offer and Bob's perceived value leaves ample room for negotiation and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,600,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own perceived value. Accepting would be a substantial loss.  It's important to demonstrate that you're serious about a fair price. We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, your offer is quite far from where we'd need to be. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the Counter:** Showing respect for Bob's offer, even if far off, helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Firm but Flexible:** While we've lowered the price, the decrease is relatively small, signaling we're serious about the product's value.
* **Focus on Value:** Reiterating the product's potential benefits to Bob reinforces the justification for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget.  To be realistic, I can offer up to $950,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly below your minimum and John's standing offer. Accepting now would be leaving money on the table. We need to show firmness and guide Bob towards a more acceptable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I see its potential for you. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduction of Competition:**  Subtly mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. 
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you signal seriousness and limit further lowballing.
* **Justification and Urgency:**  Combining a clear justification with a firm deadline encourages Bob to make a decision quickly."
