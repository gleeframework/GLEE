Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this offer reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have strong leverage. Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum allows you to negotiate from a position of strength. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high price leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than your $1,000,000 minimum while still remaining attractive to him.
* **Confident Language:**  The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value and justify the high price.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, be prepared to negotiate. You can gradually lower the price, but always keep your $1,000,000 minimum in mind."
