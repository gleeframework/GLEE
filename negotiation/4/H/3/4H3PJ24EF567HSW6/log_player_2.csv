"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($800,000 vs. $1,200,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  your initial offer is quite a bit lower than I expected. I'm willing to consider a price closer to the product's true value.  I'm offering $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer Strategy:** Bob's counter-offer is a significant increase from Alice's offer, demonstrating his willingness to pay closer to the product's value. This encourages Alice to negotiate further.
* **Middle Ground:**  The offer of $1,000,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, creating a potential middle ground between Bob's and Alice's ideal prices.
* **Message Tone:** The message is polite but firm, indicating Bob's seriousness about the negotiation while leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $950000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Alice has moved from $800,000 to $950,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential Savings:**  While $950,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it represents a significant saving compared to buying from John at $1,200,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get a lower price, but there's also a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further or the negotiations dragging on. Accepting the offer secures a good deal with a lower price."
