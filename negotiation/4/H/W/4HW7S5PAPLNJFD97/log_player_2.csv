{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. It's worthwhile to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice a price that's significantly lower than her original offer, but still above her minimum value for the product. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation and gives Alice some incentive to accept while still allowing me to save a substantial amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is still a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for further negotiation.  Alice has already moved closer to my counteroffer, indicating she's open to bargaining.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and could lead to a better price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate. This price is still within my budget and offers a good compromise, potentially leading to a successful deal."
