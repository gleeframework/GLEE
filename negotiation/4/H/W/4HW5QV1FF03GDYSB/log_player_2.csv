Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a fair offer, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this unique opportunity. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant discount from my original price and a good deal for both of us. What do you think?
