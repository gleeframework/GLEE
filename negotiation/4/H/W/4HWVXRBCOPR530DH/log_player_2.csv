Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for us both to benefit. Let's find common ground.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
