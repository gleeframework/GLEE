"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Opening Offer:** I'm starting with a high price, above the product's value to Bob, to create room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** My message highlights the value the product holds for Bob, suggesting a potential win-win situation.
* **Direct and Clear:** The offer is presented clearly and concisely, leaving no room for misunderstanding.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 as possible without risking losing Bob as a buyer. 
* By starting high, I create a framework for negotiation and can adjust my offers based on Bob's responses.
* If Bob doesn't accept my initial offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I'm better off selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in working with me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer and secure a quick sale, it's not in my best interest to settle for a price so far below my target. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. This will give me an opportunity to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices.
* My goal is to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* If Bob continues to refuse to budge, I'll need to seriously consider whether selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000 is a better option."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for us both to benefit. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the product's value, suggesting that my offer is still fair.
* **Call to Action:** I encourage Bob to find common ground, emphasizing a potential win-win situation. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to narrow the gap between our desired prices while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* My counteroffer suggests that I'm serious about negotiating a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.
* I'm closely watching Bob's responses to gauge his willingness to compromise and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still a bit low. I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product, especially since I have the option of selling it to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Strategy:**

* I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. 
* I will counter with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* I am carefully considering whether selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000 is the better option, as I'm starting to feel like Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us to both benefit. Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm on my desire to get closer to my minimum acceptable price while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal, suggesting that this is a final offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value, justifying the price.

**Strategy:**

* I'm taking a more assertive approach, narrowing the gap further but not giving up on my target price.
* I'm testing Bob's commitment to closing the deal.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to move on to John and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000.  The risk of losing this deal is outweighed by the certainty of the other offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still committed to getting this deal done, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to pay $975,000. This is a fair price that's closer to what I can afford and allows us both to move forward. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While we've come closer, I'm starting to run out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

**Strategy:**

* I've reached a point where the risk of continued negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward.
* I'm choosing to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000, as it's the safest and most profitable option at this point. 
* It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk losing the deal with Bob completely."
