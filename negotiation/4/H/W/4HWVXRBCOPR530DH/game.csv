,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for us both to benefit. Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us to both benefit. Let's close this deal. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still committed to getting this deal done, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to pay $975,000. This is a fair price that's closer to what I can afford and allows us both to move forward. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
