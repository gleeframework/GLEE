Round 7
Alice's offer:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, her ""final offer"" of $81.50 is still above your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and you risk losing out on a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
