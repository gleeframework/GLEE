"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great price considering the potential return on your investment. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. How about $1050000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you considering the potential benefits. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1000000. How about $980000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",980000.0,Bob,4,
