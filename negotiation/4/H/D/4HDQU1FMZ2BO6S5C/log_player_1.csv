This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $10,000 is my minimum, Bob's immediate counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility. I believe $12,000 is a fair price, considering my minimum and Bob's interest."

Bob is not willing to budge from his initial offer. It seems he's only interested in paying my absolute minimum. While I would prefer to sell for a higher price, I don't want to risk going through multiple rounds of counteroffers with no guarantee of a better deal. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, which is my priority at this point."
