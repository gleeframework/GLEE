"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $120.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. It's still a great deal for a product like this! What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $127.50? This would allow us both to come to a mutually agreeable price.",127.5,Bob,4,
