Since your maximum budget is $120, I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will hopefully encourage Alice to negotiate, and we can find a price that works for both of us."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget but is still above my desired price point. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm running out of rounds. To avoid risking a deal breaking down completely, it's more prudent to buy from John. It's less risky than potentially ending the negotiation without securing the product. While I'm saving less money this way, it guarantees I get the product within my budget."
