"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,100,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $1,200,000. Would you be open to $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
