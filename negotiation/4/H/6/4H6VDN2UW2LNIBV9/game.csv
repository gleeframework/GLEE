"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do better than $800,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth considering.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
