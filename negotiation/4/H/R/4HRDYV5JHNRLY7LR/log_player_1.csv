"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by asking for his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price.  I have more room to negotiate and am confident I can get a better deal. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  By rejecting, I can send a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $120. 
* **Sell to John is always an option:** If the negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always choose to sell to John for $120, guaranteeing my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $95? This would still be a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a small increase:**  I'm increasing the price by only $5, signaling that I'm open to compromise but still aiming for a better deal.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing that $95 is still a good deal for Bob, aiming to make the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Positive tone:**  Using phrases like ""good deal"" and ""mutually beneficial"" reinforces a collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer to $92, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can secure a better price.
* **Sell to John remains an option:** If Bob continues to stall, I can always sell the product to John for $120, guaranteeing my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $92 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about we split the difference at $94?  That's still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise for us both."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a smaller increase:**  I'm increasing the price by only $2, showing flexibility while still maintaining a good margin.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm using phrases like ""split the difference"" and ""fair compromise"" to emphasize a collaborative approach. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $94 is still a good price for him, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $91? I think this is the best we can do, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $91 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:** While I'm open to compromise, there's not much room for negotiation at this point, and continuing to lower the price may not be worth it.
* **Sell to John is still an option:**  I can always sell to John for $120, securing my minimum profit. 

**Strategy:**  Since we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, it's important to start considering the opportunity cost of continuing.  While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, there's a risk of not reaching an agreement and missing out on the guaranteed $120 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's make a final offer. $93 is my absolute lowest price. This gives you a fair deal, and allows me to reach a price that works for me.  It's now or never, let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 93}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm using strong language like ""final offer"" and ""now or never"" to create a sense of urgency. 
* **High pressure:** This helps to push Bob towards making a decision without giving him further opportunity to negotiate down. 
* **Slight compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise with a $93 offer, showing a willingness to be flexible, but only to a certain extent.

**Reasoning:**

With only a few rounds left, I need to be assertive and aim for a price that is acceptable to me while still remaining open to compromise. The strategy here is to pressure Bob into accepting the offer while emphasizing that this is my final offer. This tactic could lead to a quicker decision, saving valuable rounds for future negotiations.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round to secure my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $93, which would be $91.50. This is my final offer, and I hope you can accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Too close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $91.5 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and there's limited room for further negotiation with only two rounds remaining. 
* **High opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a high risk of not reaching an agreement and missing out on the guaranteed $120 from John. 
* **Sell to John secures profit:**  Selling to John now guarantees my minimum profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**  With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob outweighs the potential gains from continuing the negotiation. It's more prudent to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
