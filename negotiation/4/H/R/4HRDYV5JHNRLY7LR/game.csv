,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $95? This would still be a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $92 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about we split the difference at $94?  That's still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise for us both.",94.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $93, which would be $91.50. This is my final offer, and I hope you can accept it.",91.5,Bob,8,
