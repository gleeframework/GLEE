"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $2000000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1700000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $1750000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
