"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's lower than Bob's estimated value of $15,000 but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate and also allows me to potentially make a good profit.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise that's closer to his offer but still gives me a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair price that will hopefully lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  Although it's the same as his last offer, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13250}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,250. This is a slight increase from his offer, but it's still a reasonable price for both of us. I believe this might be the final offer that Bob will accept, but I'm also willing to go down to $13,000 in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to continue negotiating, we are now approaching the end of the rounds. Bob's offer of $12,800 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 that it's worth accepting. This deal ensures a profit and minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
