Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This allows for a potential middle ground to be reached, satisfying both of our needs. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage to be firm but also open to a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000.  
* **I have leverage with John:**  Knowing I can get $1,200,000 from John gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product and also gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  $1,075,000 is still above my minimum, and I can still fall back on John's offer if needed.
* **Fair Compromise:**  This price represents a fair compromise between our initial positions, potentially leading to a quick deal."
