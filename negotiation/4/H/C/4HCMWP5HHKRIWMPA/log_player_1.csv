{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to compromise if necessary.

By offering a price slightly lower than your minimum, you are showing good faith and willingness to negotiate. This increases the chances of reaching an agreement with Bob, while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This would allow us both to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
