"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This would allow us both to make a fair profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.  How about $1,037,500?  This is a compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
