Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm framing the price as fair, considering its value to both of us. This emphasizes that the price is not arbitrary but based on the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, signaling I'm open to discussion.

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiation range. 
* If he counters with a lower price, I'll assess his offer and counter again, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer as a safety net. 
* If Bob rejects my initial offer outright, I'll consider moving to John immediately, as I know I can secure a better price with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:**  $650,000 is far below my $1,000,000 floor and even below Bob's estimated value of $800,000.
* **John offers a better deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

*  I will reject Bob's offer and immediately move to selling to John, as it's the most advantageous option for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $800,000. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:**  $850,000 is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value for Bob:**  Reminding him of the product's worth to him (even if I'm not accepting his offer) keeps the negotiation focused on the product's true value.
* **Opening for a final deal:**  By stating ""Let's find a middle ground,"" I'm suggesting a potential for a final agreement.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer aims to test Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I'll likely move to John, as I'm closer to my minimum and the risk of further negotiation is high.
* If he accepts, I'll secure a good price while avoiding the risk of a long negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  I could go up to $700,000.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:**  Bob's ""tight budget"" suggests he's unlikely to go much higher, and further negotiation would likely be time-consuming with no guarantee of a good outcome.
* **John offers a secure and profitable option:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids the risk of a prolonged and potentially unsuccessful negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:** 

I'm choosing to maximize my profit by selling to John. While I'm disappointed I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, John's offer provides a certain and profitable solution."
