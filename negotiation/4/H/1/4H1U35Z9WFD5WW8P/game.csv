"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen! ",13500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you meet me halfway?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $12,500? That's still a good price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,500. How about $11,750? Can you consider that?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  $11,750 is a good offer, but I'm going to need a bit more to make this work for me. How about $12,250? It's a small step closer to my asking price, and I think it's still a fair deal for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. ",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $12,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $11,900? It's the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $11,900 is a very fair offer, but I'm just a bit short of my target. How about $12,000?  It's the bare minimum I can accept. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you. ",12000.0,Alice,7,
