Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum values:** You know you can sell the product to John for $1,200,000, and Bob values it at $1,000,000. This gives you a bargaining range.
* **Aiming high, but reasonably:**  Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,200,000) gives you the best chance to maximize your profit. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept your offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his valuation of the product."
