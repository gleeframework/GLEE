Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $150 to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also including a positive message to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject it and try to get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it for $145.  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $145 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $150.  I'll reject it and try to get a better offer from him in the next round.  It's getting close to the point where I might consider selling to John, but I'll see if I can get Bob to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  Let's try one more time. I'm willing to drop down to $135. If this isn't acceptable to you, I'll have to consider selling to someone else."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $135 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $125 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still not quite there. I'll reject it and try one more time to get a higher price from him. It's getting risky, as I have fewer rounds left, but I'm hoping I can convince him to pay a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time here. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130.  This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum price of $150 and we are running out of time.  I've made several concessions, but he's not budging.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150.  This will ensure I get my minimum price and don't waste any more time."
