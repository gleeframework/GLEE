Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120} 
 
**Reasoning:** 

Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($80) allows room for negotiation. It also tests Bob's eagerness and potentially lets you secure a much higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own stated value. This suggests he's willing to negotiate further. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to the product's actual worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $60 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties and can facilitate a quicker agreement.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $90 ensures you make a profit while remaining within a reasonable range of Bob's perceived value.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Bob's flexibility and willingness to move closer to your desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $70 is still below your initial target, it's now a reasonable compromise. 

* **Profitable:** You're still making a profit over your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Further negotiation might alienate Bob. Accepting ensures a sale and avoids the risk of him walking away. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Holding out for a slightly higher price from Bob might not be worth the time and effort, especially since you have a guaranteed $80 offer from John."
