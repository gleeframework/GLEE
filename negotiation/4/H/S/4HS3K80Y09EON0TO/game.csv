,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on this product.  While I'm interested,  $110 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $105. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit above my target price.  Would you consider $102?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to make the purchase.",102.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to compromise. I'm still a bit away from your target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $104. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",104.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $104 is still a little too high.  Let's split the difference - how about $103?  That's a fair price for both of us.",103.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $108. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,7,
