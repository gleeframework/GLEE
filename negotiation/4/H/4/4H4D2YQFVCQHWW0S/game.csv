"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $9,500? This is a great deal for you, and it leaves some room for me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. While $9,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $9,250? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal! ",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,6,
