"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, knowing that it's more than what the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for some room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like I'm willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $9,500? This is a great deal for you, and it leaves some room for me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob by highlighting the ""great deal"" he's getting.
* **Appeal to Reason:** I'm reminding Bob that I need to make a profit while still being open to finding a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $9,500 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can push for a higher price. There's still potential to get a better deal, and I have time on my side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. While $9,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $9,250? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing the offer by a small amount ($250) to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in too quickly.
* **Framing the Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this is a ""fair compromise"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is an opportunity to ""close the deal."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price. It's better for me to take John's offer of $12,000 and ensure a profitable sale."
