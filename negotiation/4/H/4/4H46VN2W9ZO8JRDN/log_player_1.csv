Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your fallback offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Zone:**  $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that profit zone as possible, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain, which is a strong incentive for him to accept. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong starting point, it allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. If he's more agreeable, this offer is a good balance.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, you might adjust the price slightly lower to encourage a fast decision."
