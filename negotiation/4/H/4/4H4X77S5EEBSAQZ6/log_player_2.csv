Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. Let's try $1,225,000. This is a bit above your latest offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and closer to Bob's target price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving Bob with no other option than to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
