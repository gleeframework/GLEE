"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price.  $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for both of us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice. While $1,150,000 is closer to Bob's target, there's still room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating. While $1,125,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, there is still potential to save more money. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to offer $1,110,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1110000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,110,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1,120,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits for both of us.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue negotiating with Alice. While $1,120,000 is getting close to his target, it's still worth trying to get Alice to drop the price a little further.  There are a few rounds left, and he has the option to buy from John if he can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up to $1,115,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1115000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,115,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1,130,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,130,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

With only one round left, and Alice not budging significantly, Bob should buy from John.  The potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of not reaching a deal.  John's price of $1,000,000 is Bob's best option at this point."
