Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is more than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value.  I'll counter Bob's offer."

While I'd prefer a higher price, $875,000 is a good compromise and still significantly higher than John's offer. It's time to close the deal and secure the sale."
