"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to be careful with my finances.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're being cautious with your finances, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $9500. I've already stretched my budget as far as I can, and I'm worried that if I go any higher, I'll be cutting into my savings. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,6,
