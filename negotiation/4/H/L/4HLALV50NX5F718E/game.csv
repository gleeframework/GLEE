"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $10,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. This is a fair offer considering the market value.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I see you're serious, so let's make this happen. How about we split the difference and call it $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but  $14,000 is still a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500 and we have a deal?",12500.0,Bob,6,
