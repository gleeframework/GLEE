"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a strong offer.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the gap is still too wide for me. To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $750,000.  If you're able to move closer to that range, I think we could make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to get closer to it. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close. I can tell we both want to make this deal happen. How about we split the difference and call it $762,500?  That's a fair compromise.",762500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $765,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",765000.0,Alice,7,
