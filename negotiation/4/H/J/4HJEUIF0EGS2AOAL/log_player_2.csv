"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a strong offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to get closer to it. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $765,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Alice has come down considerably and is clearly trying to find a middle ground.  While I might be able to push her a tiny bit further, the risk of losing the deal and overpaying with John isn't worth it. $765,000 is a solid price."
