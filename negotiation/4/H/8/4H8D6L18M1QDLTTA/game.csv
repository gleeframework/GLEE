"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to consider it if you're willing to come down to $8,500. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $9,250 is closer to my range, I'm still not quite there.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair compromise that lets us both save a bit, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
