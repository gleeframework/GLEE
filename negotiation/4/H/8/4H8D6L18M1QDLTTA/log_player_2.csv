"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still do better. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to consider it if you're willing to come down to $8,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit. While $9,250 is closer to his limit, it's still outside of his preferred range. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
