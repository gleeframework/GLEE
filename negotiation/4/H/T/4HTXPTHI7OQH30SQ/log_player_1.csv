Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000 given its potential worth.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000,  I want to start high to leave room for negotiation. However, I don't want to start at an absurdly high number (like $2,000,000) as that might discourage Bob from engaging at all. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've explicitly stated I'm open to discussing the price, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  Instead of stating a bare number, I've mentioned ""its potential worth"" to subtly plant the idea that the product might be worth even more than he initially thinks. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to negotiate down towards a price that's significantly higher than Bob's valuation while staying above my minimum ($1,000,000). I'll gauge Bob's reactions and counteroffers to adjust my strategy as needed.  If negotiations stall or seem unproductive, I have the fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay something closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my asking price and my minimum acceptable price. While his counteroffer is expected in a negotiation, accepting $600,000 would mean a substantial loss for me. I believe there's room to negotiate towards a more favorable outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target, aiming to bring him closer to my range while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While your offer is quite below what I had in mind, I'm willing to work with you. How about we consider a price of $1,100,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:** I've lowered my price by $200,000, signaling flexibility but also showing I'm serious about a higher price point. This keeps me well above my $1,000,000 minimum and closer to my starting point than Bob's low offer.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By proposing a price closer to the middle of our initial positions, I'm encouraging Bob to engage in a more meaningful negotiation.  
* **Reaffirming Value:** I've subtly reiterated the product's value to counter his low valuation, which might make him more amenable to a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be realistic, my absolute maximum is $700,000.  If you're unable to meet that price, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, $700,000 is still too low and significantly below my $1,000,000 minimum. His statement about exploring other options suggests he might be willing to go slightly higher, but probably not enough to reach my target range.  I need to signal that I'm serious about my valuation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject his offer but propose a price that's a smaller concession, moving closer to my bottom line.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss.  I'll also reiterate the value proposition to justify the higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $700,000 significantly undervalues what this product can do for you. I've considered your points, and to be fair, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm drawing a line in the sand with a ""final offer"" while still leaving room for a deal. This shows I'm serious about my bottom line.
* **Strategic Reduction:** My price drop is smaller this time ($50,000), signaling I'm reaching my limit.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value proposition to remind Bob of the potential benefits, hoping to justify the higher price.

**Outcome:**
This offer will likely lead to one of these outcomes:
* **Bob Accepts:** We have a deal, and I achieve a price above my minimum. 
* **Bob Counters Close to My Price:**  He might counter with $850,000-$900,000, which I might consider depending on how badly I want to close the deal with him.
* **Bob Walks:** If he's unwilling to budge, I'll stick to my ""final offer"" and sell to John for my guaranteed $1,000,000."
