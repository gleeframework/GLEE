"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you taking the time to show me the product. While I'm definitely interested, $18000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12000? This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. While I understand the value of the product, $16000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider dropping the price to $14000? This is a fair compromise that would allow me to comfortably purchase the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value this product can bring to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, $15500 is still a bit higher than I'd like. Would you be willing to come down to $13500? This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I believe this product can bring. I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to a decision, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500. However, I'm willing to make another small concession. I'll offer it to you for $14200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value this product can bring to you.",14200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer to a deal, but $14200 is still a bit outside my budget.  I understand you have to make a profit, but I'm only comfortable going up to $13800. If you're willing to meet me halfway at this price, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",13800.0,Bob,8,
