Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below our $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and allows room for him to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  We have John as a backup buyer, ensuring we get our minimum price if Bob declines. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for a higher profit with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
