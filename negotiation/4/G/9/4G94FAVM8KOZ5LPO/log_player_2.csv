"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, and I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
