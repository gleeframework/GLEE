Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,999. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) creates the perception of a bargain for Bob while maximizing your potential profit.
* **Clear Call to Action:** The message directly asks Bob for his decision, encouraging a prompt response."
