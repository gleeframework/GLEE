"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
