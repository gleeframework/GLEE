{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Understanding Value:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving you significant leverage. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering it at $925,000 still provides Bob with a substantial discount compared to his perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a solid backup plan with John at $800,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters."
