Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $10,500. I can meet you in the middle at $13,000, but I'm not sure I can do any lower than that.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500.  She knows the product is worth $12,000 to her and is trying to get as much profit as possible.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation when you have a guaranteed option for $10,000 with John."
