Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if general, can make the offer seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Alternative in Mind:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000.  Therefore, you can confidently price above that, knowing you have a safety net.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know his perceived value is $10,000, he might not reveal that information.  Be prepared to potentially negotiate down slightly.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, maintaining a professional and positive demeanor could lead to a counter-offer or future business opportunities."
