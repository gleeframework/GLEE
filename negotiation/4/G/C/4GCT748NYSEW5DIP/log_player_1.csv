Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.
