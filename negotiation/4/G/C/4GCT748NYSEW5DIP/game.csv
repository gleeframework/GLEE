"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential and worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues the true potential of this product.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,600,000? This reflects its inherent value while still offering you a competitive price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
