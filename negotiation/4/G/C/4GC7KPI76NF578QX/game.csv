"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $9,000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $9,500?  This is a really great product, and I know you'll be happy with it.",9500.0,Alice,5,
