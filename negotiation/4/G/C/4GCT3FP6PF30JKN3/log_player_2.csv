"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  $140 is close to your maximum, but there's still room to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

``` 

$135 is a good price. It's still below your maximum, and Alice is likely to be happy with the deal as well.  It's not worth risking a further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a failed deal, especially with John offering the product for $150."
