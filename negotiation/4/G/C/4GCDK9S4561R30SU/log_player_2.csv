{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's way too early to accept Alice's offer.  The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is offering it at $15,000. There's a lot of room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $13,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my target price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to try and get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a deal. However, $10,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,000, but I'd like to propose a price of $11,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,750 is closer to my ideal price, it's still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a lower price.  There's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'd like to propose a price of $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,250 is tempting, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm only a few rounds away from getting the product from John for $8,000, so it's worth pushing Alice a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I hear you. $11,250 is still a little high for me, but I'm feeling generous. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I'd like to propose a price of $11,375. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's the best we can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is at her lowest price, and it's still above my target price. I've been negotiating for a while, and I'm getting close to my limit.  It's time to take the deal with John."
