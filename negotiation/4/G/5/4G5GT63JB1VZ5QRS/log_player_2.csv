"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for under $120. Alice's initial offer of $170 is far too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $170 is a bit out of my budget.  How about we start at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still too high for Bob, who is aiming for under $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  I'm still looking to spend less than $120 though. How about we try $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. While it's getting closer, Bob can likely still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're getting closer to your minimum, Alice, but I'm really trying to stay under $120.  Would you be willing to do $128? That's a good middle ground for us both."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm really close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $145? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $145 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  While they are getting closer, Bob has only two rounds left to negotiate.  At this point, it's more likely that Alice will not come down further, and buying from John for $120 is a guaranteed deal within Bob's budget."
