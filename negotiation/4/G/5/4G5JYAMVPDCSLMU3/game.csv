"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of both our needs. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $825,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the potential of this product and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of $837,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",837500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my target price to make this deal work.  How about $850,000? This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  We're getting down to the wire, so let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal possible. However, with only one round left, I need to be close to my target price to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $840,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.  If we don't reach a deal, I will unfortunately have to accept John's offer for $800,000.",840000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your understanding, but I'm afraid I must stick to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to pay. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider John's offer for $800,000.",825000.0,Bob,10,
