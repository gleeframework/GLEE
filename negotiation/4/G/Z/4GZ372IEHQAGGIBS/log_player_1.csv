Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to make a deal that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$12,000 is a good compromise:** It's more than what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000), but significantly less than what I could get from John ($15,000).
* **The message is positive and persuasive:** I acknowledge the value of the product to me while emphasizing a potential benefit for Bob.
* **This approach increases my chances of a successful sale:**  Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his initial assessment, especially if I highlight the potential savings. 

**Important Note:** This is a strategic approach, but the actual outcome depends on Bob's willingness to negotiate."
