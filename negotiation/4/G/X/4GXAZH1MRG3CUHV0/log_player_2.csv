Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1050000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1100000? This would still represent a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a price that works for both of us.
