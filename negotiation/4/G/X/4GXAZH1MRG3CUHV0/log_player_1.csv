{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I'm aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $1,200,000.  By leaving some room for negotiation, I can potentially increase the final sale price. I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't accept a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my desired price and even below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues the product. I'll make a counteroffer and continue negotiating."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,100,000? This would still represent a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
