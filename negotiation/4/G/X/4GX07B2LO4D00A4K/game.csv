"Hi Bob, I understand you have a lower budget in mind, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $115. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it.",115.0,Alice,5,
