Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to compromise. After careful consideration, we're willing to make another concession to reach a deal.

**Reasoning:**  While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly set on staying above $610,000.  At $615,000, I'm saving a significant amount compared to John's offer ($800,000) and further haggling might irritate Alice and risk the deal."
