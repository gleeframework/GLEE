{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows me to maximize my earnings while still being attractive to Bob. Here's the logic behind it:

* **Above Bob's valuation:** $9,500 is above Bob's valuation of $8,000, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **Below my minimum:** It's below my minimum of $10,000, but it leaves room for potential negotiation and a higher final price. 
* **Strong opening:** It sets a clear price point and shows I'm serious about a deal, while leaving space for negotiation.

I will carefully assess Bob's response and counteroffers to determine if I should accept them or counter-offer again.  Ultimately, I want to secure the highest possible price while keeping the negotiation open and friendly. If Bob proves difficult or unwilling to meet my expectations, I can always fall back on John's offer for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial offer and also below my minimum value. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can initiate a counteroffer and explore the possibility of finding a middle ground that's more favorable to me. I'm confident that I can still reach a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to give in to his lowball offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering $9,000 as a counteroffer because:

* **Compromise:** It's a compromise between my initial offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500.
* **Fair Value:** $9,000 is still above Bob's valuation of $8,000, but it's a price I can reasonably accept. 
* **Clear Signal:** It shows I'm serious about negotiating but won't settle for a price that undervalues the product. 

By demonstrating flexibility while maintaining a firm stance, I'm aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob.  If he's unwilling to budge from his $8,500 offer, I'm ready to consider selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my limits. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm not willing to completely settle for a price that undervalues the product, even if it means potentially losing out on this deal.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore a final counteroffer that may allow us to reach a mutually agreeable price. However, if Bob remains inflexible, I'm prepared to sell the product to John for $10,000, ensuring I achieve my minimum desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $8,900. This is the absolute lowest I can go while still feeling comfortable with the deal. It's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that gives you a great value.  Let's make this happen. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

This is my final counteroffer, and it reflects a genuine attempt to bridge the gap with Bob.  Here's why:

* **Final Compromise:** $8,900 is a significant concession from my previous offer of $9,000, but it's still a reasonable price point considering the value of the product.
* **Close to Minimum:** It's very close to my minimum desired price of $8,750, showing a commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Clear Signal:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, and I'm prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me at this price.

This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to accept a price that's still favorable to him while ensuring I achieve a fair return. If Bob rejects, I will proceed with selling to John for $10,000."
