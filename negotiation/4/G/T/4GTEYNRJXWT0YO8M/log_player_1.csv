Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than the guaranteed value of $12,000. It leaves room for negotiation, potentially earning more than the minimum, but still offers a reasonable starting point for Bob.  

Here's why:

* **Higher than minimum:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. 
* **Not too high:** It's still within a range that Bob might consider, as he doesn't know the product's true value to you. 
* **Allows for negotiation:**  If Bob wants to haggle, there's room to compromise without losing too much.
