Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while ensuring a sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Creating Urgency:** Highlighting the limited-time nature of the offer adds pressure for Bob to accept before he potentially loses the opportunity.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing the sale with Bob, who offers a higher potential return than your guaranteed sale to John."
