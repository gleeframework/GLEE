"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to start the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you offering the product, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to consider $15,000, which is my maximum budget for this purchase."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $17,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his target price. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer will continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $15,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'm prepared to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 15000}
