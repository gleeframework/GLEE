"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, reflecting the significant savings I'm seeking. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also acknowledging your desire for a discount.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This offer demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I believe the product's value to you justifies this price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a new price of $862,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",862500.0,Alice,5,
