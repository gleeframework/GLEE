"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, reflecting the significant savings I'm seeking. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also acknowledging your desire for a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target price, I can still try to push for a lower price. $850,000 is still significantly above what I'm aiming for. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This offer demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I believe the product's value to you justifies this price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a new price of $862,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $862,500 is getting close to my target price, and it's likely she won't budge much further. While I could keep negotiating, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer or her lowering the price by a negligible amount is high. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price, considering I have limited rounds and the alternative is buying from John at a much higher price."
