Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get as close to my minimum price as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, allowing for a potential win-win situation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the perceived value to Bob, emphasizing it's a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **If negotiations stall:** I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'd like to sell, Bob's offer is $50 below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price closer to my minimum.
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer ensures I won't lose out completely if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer, aiming to find a price that is both acceptable to me and within Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential deal, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground price, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justify the Price:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Maintain a Profit Margin:**  $115 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, ensuring I maintain a decent profit margin.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! The deal is closed.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to carefully consider his next offer and potentially make another counteroffer, keeping my minimum price in mind.
* **If negotiations stall:** I still have the option to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still think $100 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his $100 offer, which is significantly below my minimum price. Further negotiations seem unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. It's a sure win, while continuing with Bob risks ending up with nothing.
* **Time is Money:**  Spending more time negotiating with Bob could lead to a missed opportunity to sell to another buyer.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd like to reach a deal with Bob, his stubbornness on price makes John the more reliable and profitable option."
