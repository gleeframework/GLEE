"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $140 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your product, $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $10.  He wants to show he's serious about buying the product but also signal that he won't settle for Alice's initial price. This strategy aims to establish a negotiating range early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $135 for the product. This still allows us to achieve a good profit while being fair to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is within Bob's acceptable range, as he's willing to pay up to $150. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $15 compared to buying from John and is only $5 more than his initial counteroffer. This is a good compromise and a reasonable deal for Bob."
