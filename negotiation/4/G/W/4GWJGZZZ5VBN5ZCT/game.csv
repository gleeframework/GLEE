"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $11,500 for it. Let me know if you're open to that price.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
