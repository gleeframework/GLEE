Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $90, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive language:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I ask for Bob's opinion to encourage him to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested in the product.  I can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for $80, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $85?  That's a good compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** My counter-offer is $85, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize the worth of the price.
* **Compromise language:** I use phrases like ""come down a little"" and ""good compromise"" to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to reason:**  I  frame the offer as a good deal for Bob, even with the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $78? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $78 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, it's still below it.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to more back-and-forth and potentially a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed sale to John:**  Selling to John for $80 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation.

Since I'm close to my minimum price and can guarantee a sale with John, selling to John now is the most logical choice."
