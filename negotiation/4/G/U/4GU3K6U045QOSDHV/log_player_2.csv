"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, it's still not within your desired range. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000 at this time. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget of $10,000. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a lower price again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price of $11200. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is still above my budget of $10,000.  While she's showing a willingness to negotiate, I'm starting to feel like we might be stuck in a cycle of small concessions. Since John is willing to sell the product for my maximum price, it makes more sense to just buy it from him and save the time and effort of further negotiations."
