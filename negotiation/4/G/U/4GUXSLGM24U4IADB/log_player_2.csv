"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $8,500. It's in great condition and worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $8,500. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $8,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  $8,000 is my absolute bottom line for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $8,250 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Since Bob can buy the product from John for $8,000, it's better to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
