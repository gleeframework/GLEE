# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, there's still room to negotiate. You can likely secure a price closer to $900,000 by making another counteroffer.  This is a better strategy than accepting her offer or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to sell it to you for $975000. This is a fair price, considering the profit I'll make. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price:** You've successfully negotiated the price down from $1,000,000 to $975,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be fruitful:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **The price is still within your budget:** While not the ideal price, it's still significantly lower than John's offer, making it a worthwhile purchase. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action in this scenario."
