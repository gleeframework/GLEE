"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to make a more economical purchase, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business or personal life.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $875000 is a fair price for this product. Considering its unique features and potential benefits, I'm willing to offer it to you for $925000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good value for the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
