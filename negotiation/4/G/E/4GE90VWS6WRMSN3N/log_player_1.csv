Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $750000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. This reflects its potential value and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
