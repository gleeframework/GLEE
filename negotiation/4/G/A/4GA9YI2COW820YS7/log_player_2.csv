{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This offer is significantly higher than my limit and what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I like it, $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's low but still gives room for Alice to counter and find a middle ground."

Alice is coming down, but the offer is still above my limit and what John is offering.  I'll try to negotiate a bit further."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice.  How about we settle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110

Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This price is close enough to John's offer and within my acceptable range. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and I'd rather secure the deal now than risk the price going up or missing out."
