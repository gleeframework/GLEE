"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? This gives you a great deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $92 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise.",92.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway with your last offer.  I'm still a bit too far from my target price, though. How about we go with $94?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",94.0,Alice,5,

"I see your reasoning, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $93 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",93.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference again â€“ $93.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  It's getting late in the negotiations, so let's make a final decision. What do you think?",93.5,Alice,7,
