Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'll counter with a higher offer, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to drop below my minimum value yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer a higher price,  it's likely we won't get much closer and accepting now is the best option to secure a profit."
