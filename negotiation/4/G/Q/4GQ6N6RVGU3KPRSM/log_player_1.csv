I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of this product.  How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and it'll give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This is the maximum I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his offer, and I've already made a counteroffer.  It's clear we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll take the $10,000 from John to avoid further negotiation."
