"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's true interest level.  
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" without being too specific, you create intrigue and justify the high price somewhat. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's feedback, setting the stage for a potentially successful negotiation. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** While you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he might not reveal that information easily.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you a strong fallback position. You don't need to settle for less than that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking something closer to  $1,000,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and what John is willing to pay.  While his counter was expected, accepting $1,000,000 would be a substantial loss. You have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we consider $1,750,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Meeting Bob ""halfway"" might seem like a big jump, but it's a strong anchoring tactic. It keeps the price significantly above Bob's offer while appearing reasonable. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Re-emphasizing the ""true potential"" reinforces the idea that Bob is getting a deal, even at this higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal how flexible Bob is willing to be and if a deal close to your target is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his true valuation, but you're still above it and have negotiating room. While $1,250,000 is tempting, you can likely get closer to $1,500,000, especially with John as your backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'd be willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe that represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This time, the price drop is smaller ($150,000) to signal that you're reaching your limit.
* **Finding a Solution:**  The language emphasizes a mutually beneficial outcome, maintaining a collaborative tone.
* **Justification:** The price is still framed as a compromise to manage Bob's expectations, but you remain firm on the product's worth. 

**Key Considerations:**

* You're getting closer to John's offer, so you'll need to decide how much more you're willing to concede before switching to that deal.
* Bob's response to this offer will be critical in gauging his willingness to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate the movement you've made.  To be honest with you, my absolute upper limit is $1,350,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has revealed his maximum price, and it's still significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a substantial increase. You've made significant concessions, and he's only moved up $100,000 from his previous offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John provides a certain sale at $1,500,000. There's no guarantee you can get Bob much closer to that price, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing both buyers.

**It's time to cut your losses with Bob and take the guaranteed deal with John. While you could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk outweighs the potential reward.**"
