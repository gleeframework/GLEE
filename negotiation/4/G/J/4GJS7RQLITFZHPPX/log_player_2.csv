"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it for $14,000. I'm confident you'll find this price fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to my maximum budget than her own valuation. I should counter with a significantly lower price to see how much wiggle room there is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a competitive price considering the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but $12,000 is still too high.  We're making progress, but I need to push her down further. I'll counteroffer with a smaller increase to show her I'm serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $10,500? That's a fair offer considering the current market."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $11,500 is my final offer - it's a fantastic deal considering the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is getting close. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, but I think there's still some room to negotiate. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I want to see if she'll budge from $11,500 first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
