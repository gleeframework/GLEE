"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd love to offer you this great product for a special price of $180. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own product valuation. It makes the most sense to go with your alternative option and buy from John for $100."
