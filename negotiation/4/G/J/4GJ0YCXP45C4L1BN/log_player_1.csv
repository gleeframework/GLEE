Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm emphasizing that the product is valuable to Bob, which might encourage him to accept a higher price. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm aware that I have a backup offer of $8,000 from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:**  While $9,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Negotiation power:**  I still have leverage because I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $8,000. This allows me to be more aggressive in my counteroffer.
* **Further negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to get closer to my desired price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer outright, but I'm also not rejecting it entirely. This shows flexibility while keeping the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Splitting the difference:** Offering $10,500 splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's, making it seem like a compromise.
* **Re-emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll gain from the product to justify my price. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, there's still room for Bob to make a counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:**  $9,750 is very close to my desired price of $10,500, and significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  There's always the risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, or we might get stuck in a prolonged negotiation. 
* **Balancing profit and certainty:** Accepting this offer guarantees a decent profit and minimizes the chances of losing the deal entirely."
