# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item for a one-time price of $950,000. This is a rare and exclusive product that I'm confident you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  While $950,000 is still more than Alice's value of $800,000, it's significantly less than the $1,000,000 Bob would pay John. 
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $50,000."
