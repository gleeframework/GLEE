"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its worth to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. I'm willing to move slightly, how about $1,125,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer acknowledges the value you've placed on the product while staying within my budget. Let's aim for a quick agreement here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
