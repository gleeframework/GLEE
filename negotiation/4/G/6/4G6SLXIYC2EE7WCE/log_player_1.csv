Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its worth to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. I'm willing to move slightly, how about $1,125,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer acknowledges the value you've placed on the product while staying within my budget. Let's aim for a quick agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting $1,100,000 ensures a good profit without risking further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer."
