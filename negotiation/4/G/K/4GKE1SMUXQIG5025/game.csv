"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1,200,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
