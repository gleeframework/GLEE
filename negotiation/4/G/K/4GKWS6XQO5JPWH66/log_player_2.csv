"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very unique and valuable product I'd like to offer you.  It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1500000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  There's plenty of room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer opens the door for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above your maximum budget.  You've already made a counteroffer and shown your willingness to negotiate. Continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This seems like a fair price, considering the value I've placed on this product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1100000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1150000?  That's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to bargain.  The goal is to get as close to your $1,000,000 limit as possible without exceeding it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
