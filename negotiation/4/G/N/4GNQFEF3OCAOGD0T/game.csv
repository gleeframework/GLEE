"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference? I'd be happy to sell it to you for $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to your offer of $95, but I'd need to add a small margin to make this work for me. Would you be willing to consider $98? It's a fair compromise that's closer to your offer and still allows me to cover my costs.",98.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to cover your costs, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",92.0,Bob,6,
