"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for the best possible price, so starting at $110 gives me room to negotiate.
* **Justifying the price:** Mentioning the product's value encourages Bob to consider the price in relation to the perceived worth. 
* **Open communication:** Encouraging Bob to share his thoughts keeps the negotiation open and avoids a quick rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I still have rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better price by counter-offering.
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Selling to John now would result in a lower profit than what I could potentially achieve with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference? I'd be happy to sell it to you for $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  This offer aligns with my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a middle ground to show willingness to negotiate but maintain my desired profit.
* **Reiterating value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value strengthens my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially secure a better price in the next round.
* **Avoiding a lower profit:**  Selling to John for $100 would be a good outcome, but I'm optimistic that I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to your offer of $95, but I'd need to add a small margin to make this work for me. Would you be willing to consider $98? It's a fair compromise that's closer to your offer and still allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm making a small concession by dropping my price to $98, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm highlighting the compromise aspect of the offer, making it seem reasonable.
* **Maintaining profit:**  $98 is still above my minimum acceptable price and allows me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to cover your costs, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:** We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Time constraint:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob is diminishing.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a $100 profit, which is my minimum acceptable price and provides a safe and secure outcome. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk further negotiations that might not lead to a successful outcome."
