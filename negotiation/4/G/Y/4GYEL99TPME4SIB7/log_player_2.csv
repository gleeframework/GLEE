# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to make a deal.  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.  Let's find common ground here.
