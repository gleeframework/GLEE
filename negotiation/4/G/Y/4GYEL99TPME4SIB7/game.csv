"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to make a deal.  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.  Let's find common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we go with $10,750? That's the highest I'm comfortable going.",10750.0,Bob,4,
