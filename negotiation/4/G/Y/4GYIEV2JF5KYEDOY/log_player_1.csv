"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but not so high as to be immediately rejected. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is still a decent amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $850,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I hope this will encourage him to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
