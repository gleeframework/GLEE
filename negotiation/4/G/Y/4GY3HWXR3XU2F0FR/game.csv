"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12500 is closer to what I was hoping for, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $13500. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13500. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
