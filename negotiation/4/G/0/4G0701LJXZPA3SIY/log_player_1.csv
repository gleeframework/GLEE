Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is only possible if you offer a price below your guaranteed amount, which wouldn't be in your best interest.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA that benefits you, the best strategy is to offer a price that Bob will almost certainly reject, allowing you to sell to John.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other potential buyers. I'm confident in its value, so I'm setting the price at $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Why This Works**

* **High Price:** The price is significantly above Bob's valuation, making rejection likely.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and implies strong demand, which might tempt Bob even though the price is unfavorable. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you are certain John will fulfill his offer of $1,500,000."
