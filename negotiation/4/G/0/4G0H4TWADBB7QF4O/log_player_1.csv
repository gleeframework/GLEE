Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interests:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob, highlighting the potential for him to acquire the product at a price below his perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I leave room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation process open.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The mention of John as an alternative buyer subtly increases the pressure on Bob to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for a quick sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is an improvement from his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob acknowledges the value of the product. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I want to try and meet somewhere in the middle, potentially at $950,000, to see if I can secure a better price than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price is fair considering the value of the product and our time. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $950,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and his offer of $850,000.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the time we've both invested in the negotiation. This adds some pressure and encourages Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm still open to further discussion and negotiation, keeping the door open for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to move forward quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $900,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, it's significantly closer. 
* **Potential for Quick Sale:** Bob's offer emphasizes a ""quick sale,"" which could be beneficial in terms of closing the deal and avoiding further negotiation. 
* **Risk of Losing a Sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away completely.  There's also no guarantee that John will still be interested in buying the product if we don't close a deal with Bob soon.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer at $900,000 provides a reasonable compromise and secures a sale without jeopardizing the possibility of selling to John."
