"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is my best offer, and it's the most I can afford at this time. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1000000.  However, I'm still capped at $850000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the market conditions.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
