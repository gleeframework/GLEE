Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe the price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This leaves room for you to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows that you're serious about selling to Bob, but not desperate.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  See if he's willing to negotiate or if he immediately rejects the offer. 
* **Potentially close the deal:**  Bob might accept your offer, especially if he values the product higher than he lets on.
* **Set the stage for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you have room to lower your price strategically in subsequent rounds.

Remember, it's crucial to analyze Bob's responses and adjust your strategy accordingly.  You can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is my best offer, and it's the most I can afford at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's important to remember your goal is to earn as much as possible. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your leverage:**  By not accepting his low offer, you demonstrate your willingness to walk away.
* **Explore potential for a better deal:**  You can counteroffer with a price that's closer to your minimum value, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Avoid settling for less than you deserve:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing a significant amount of money.

It's risky to accept Bob's offer at this point. By rejecting it, you keep the negotiation open and have the chance to achieve a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **It's a significant compromise:**  You're dropping your price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:**  You're not accepting Bob's offer outright, which keeps the negotiation open and allows for potential further compromises.
* **It's still above your minimum value:**  You're not giving away the product for less than your minimum acceptable price, which is crucial to achieving your goal.

By offering $1,000,000, you're showing Bob that you're serious about selling to him, but you're not willing to settle for an unreasonable price.  This counteroffer is a good balance between maintaining your leverage and exploring a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1000000.  However, I'm still capped at $850000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the market conditions.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer remains stubbornly at $850,000, which is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating and try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's becoming clear that we're at an impasse.  

Here's why selling to John is the best decision at this point:

* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag out the process and cost you valuable time.  You need to act decisively to maximize your earnings.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John is offering you a guaranteed $1,500,000 for the product, which meets your minimum value and provides a secure outcome.
* **No further risk:** You're not taking any chances with Bob's unwillingness to budge.  Selling to John eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation.

While you would have liked to get a higher price, selling to John is the most sensible and profitable choice given Bob's stubborn stance.  You can always revisit the possibility of selling to Bob in the future if his circumstances change."
