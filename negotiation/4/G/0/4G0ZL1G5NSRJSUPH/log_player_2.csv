"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As the current owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. I think this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save even more.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met Bob halfway, bringing the price down to $850,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's still significantly cheaper than buying from John.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but Alice has indicated this is her final offer. It's likely further negotiation won't lead to a significantly lower price, and Bob could risk losing the deal entirely."
