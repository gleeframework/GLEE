Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still allows for some negotiation room. I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that low.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While Bob has increased his offer to $90, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not confident that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a higher price.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with, so that's the best option for me."
