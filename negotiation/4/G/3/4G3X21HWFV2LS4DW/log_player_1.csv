"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiations to leave room for bargaining.  I'm also framing the message in a way that highlights the value of the product to Bob, which might make him more likely to accept a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll try to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a fair price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $90. This feels like a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $90 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and go with $91? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I can't get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  It's also important to keep in mind that continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $100."
