"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a fair price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $90. This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $90 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and go with $91? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",91.0,Bob,6,
