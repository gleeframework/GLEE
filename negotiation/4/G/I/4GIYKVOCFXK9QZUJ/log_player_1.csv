Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a steal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for the highest price Bob might accept to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $90 leaves a small window for Bob to haggle (if he's so inclined) while still ensuring a good profit margin for you. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him ($100) emphasizes the benefit of the deal.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated, the fact that you have another buyer (John) implies that this offer isn't open indefinitely, subtly encouraging a decision."
