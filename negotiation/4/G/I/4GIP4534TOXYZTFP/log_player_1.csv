Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a reasonable starting point considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit.  I'm eager to see what his response will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counter-offering with $135.  This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product more than $120.  Let's see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $125.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal considering my minimum value and the risk of further negotiation.  It's also better than selling to John for $100."
