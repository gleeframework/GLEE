"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the benefit for both of us to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I want to try and negotiate a better price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit.  How about $13,500? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a compromise price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to sell for significantly less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand your position, I believe we can find a middle ground. Would $13,000 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John.  $13,000 is a good compromise, and I'm confident I can make a profit."
