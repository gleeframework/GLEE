"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. I believe this reflects a fair balance between its value and your investment.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique advantages, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,700,000 is the highest I can go. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
