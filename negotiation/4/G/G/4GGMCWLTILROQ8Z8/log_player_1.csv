"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth even more than Bob initially thought. 
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason emphasizes the product's value, even without going into specifics.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's worth exploring if Bob might be willing to go higher, especially in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value. Accepting this would be a substantial loss. It's clear we have very different valuations, so I need to counter with a price that reflects my minimum while still encouraging further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth and still allows you a considerable return on investment."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer ($200,000 decrease) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still well above my $1,000,000 minimum and above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  I've reiterated the product's value and potential ROI for Bob, reinforcing why my price is justified.
* **Pressure:** By now, Bob should understand I'm serious about the product's value. My willingness to negotiate should encourage him to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so my counteroffer is $900,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has significantly increased his offer and is now offering $900,000.  While this is still below my ideal price, it's above my absolute minimum of $1,000,000.  

It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and continuing negotiations might risk losing him altogether. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for the minimum amount."
