Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to see if we can reach an agreement.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this compromise.
