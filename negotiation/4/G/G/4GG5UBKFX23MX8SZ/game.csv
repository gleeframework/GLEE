"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that could be extremely valuable to your business.  I've assessed its worth to be at least $1,000,000, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to see if we can reach an agreement.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about $900,000? That's a fair offer that gets us closer to a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
