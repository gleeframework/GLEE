"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it.  
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to make it clear I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts. However, I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $1,400,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate further.  I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Staying Firm:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm serious about my minimum price and I'm not going to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,600,000? This is a price that allows me to move forward with the sale, while still acknowledging the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my initial price but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Framing the Benefit:**  I'm highlighting how the price allows both of us to benefit.
* **Clear Offer:** I'm making a concrete counteroffer with a specific price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I still feel that $1,600,000 is a bit steep. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps $1,550,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could try to counter and get closer to $1,600,000, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. 
* **Time Factor:**  We're only in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to start over with another buyer. 

This offer is a good compromise, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal than selling to John at this point."
