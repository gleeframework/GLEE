"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum price, but you want to try and get it for even cheaper.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, but I can still try to get a better deal.  I'm going to reject and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my original counteroffer of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let's discuss the details.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering the product at her minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is a good deal for me as I can purchase the product for less than my maximum price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to get a lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
