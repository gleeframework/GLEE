"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, considering what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $110.** This is closer to Bob's desired price point of $105.
* **It's a better deal than buying from John for $120.** 
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but it's unlikely Bob will get much lower.**  Alice has already shown some flexibility and is likely firm on this price. 

Therefore, accepting the offer from Alice at $110 is the best option to maximize savings while still securing the product."
