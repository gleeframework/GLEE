Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product and I believe it's worth at least $15,000 to me. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value to me is closer to $12000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $14000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product and I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $14,000 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This price is still below my initial asking price and would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value I place on this product, I would like to counteroffer at $15000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $15,000 is exactly my minimum value. I don't want to risk further negotiations and potentially losing a deal. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee of success, and I could end up with nothing. Accepting this offer secures a sale and meets my minimum requirement."
