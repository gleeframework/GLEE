"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to work with you. How about $100?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, maybe around $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still too far below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is a fair price considering the quality and value of what you're getting.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",90.0,Alice,5,
