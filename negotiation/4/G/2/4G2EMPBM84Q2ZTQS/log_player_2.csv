Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to work with you. How about $100?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still too far below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is a fair price considering the quality and value of what you're getting.  Let me know if you're interested in that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90, and you have a guaranteed option at $80. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
