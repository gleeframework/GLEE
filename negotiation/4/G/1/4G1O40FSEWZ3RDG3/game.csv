"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $1,100,000, my budget is limited. I am currently looking for a product within my price range of $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
