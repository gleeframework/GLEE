"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of offering $120 for it. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $120 was a bit low, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140, which would be $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This is my final offer.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $130, but no higher. Can you meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
