Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it's worth $150. Would you be interested in purchasing it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's still within a reasonable range. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I can make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob!  $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price for such a great product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $130. Would you be open to a slightly lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer by pushing for a higher price."
