"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we try $115? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $100 is the most I'm willing to spend on this.  If you're able to do that, I'm ready to buy.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110? It's the best I can do.",110.0,Alice,7,
