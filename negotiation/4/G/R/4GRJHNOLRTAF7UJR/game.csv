"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
