"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  You should try to counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still within your budget and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, there is still room for negotiation. You're within your budget, and rejecting the offer gives you another chance to potentially get an even better deal.  It's worth seeing if you can get closer to $1,000,000 by countering again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting close to your ideal price, you are still within your budget.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to potentially push Alice further down in price.  It's worth seeing if you can get even closer to $1,000,000 by countering again. You're close to a good deal, and continuing to negotiate could save you more money."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're nearly there! I'm willing to accept $1,085,000. This is a small compromise on my end, and it allows us to finalize this deal. Let's close this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,085,000, which is only $85,000 above your target price of $1,000,000.  There are a few reasons to accept this offer:

* **You're close to your goal:** You've already made significant progress in negotiations, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.
* **Time is a factor:** You have limited rounds to negotiate, and continuing might not be worth the risk.  Accepting secures the deal.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Alice may not be willing to go any lower.  Continuing might risk losing the deal and forcing you to buy from John at $1,000,000.

While a lower price would be ideal, the potential benefits of securing the deal now outweigh the potential gains from further negotiation."
