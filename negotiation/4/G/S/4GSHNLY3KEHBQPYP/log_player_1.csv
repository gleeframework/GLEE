Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to sell the product to John. I've been through several rounds of negotiations with Bob, and it seems like we're at a stalemate.  While I'm close to my desired price, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is a good deal, and I don't want to risk getting less from Bob."
