Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a fortune, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. My asking price is $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, given the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's below the value to Bob but still significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to get him invested in the deal. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This price leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. 

**Next steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:**  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth negotiating further.
* **Consider John's offer:**  If negotiations with Bob stall or become too time-consuming, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is still above my minimum, it's significantly less than the $1,400,000 I initially offered, and leaves less room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better price:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and still have leverage in the negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Continue to monitor John's offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  I understand you have a budget to adhere to, but this product is truly special and offers incredible potential.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000.
* **Focus on value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's potential to highlight the value Bob will be getting.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** The counteroffer still leaves space for Bob to potentially make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

**Next steps:**

* **Assess Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response and whether he's willing to budge further.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:** If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  The gap between our positions is now very small, making it unlikely that I can significantly increase the price further.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he might walk away, and I'll be left with John's offer, which is significantly lower.

**Next steps:**

* **Accepting the offer:**  I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and maximize my earnings, given the current circumstances."
