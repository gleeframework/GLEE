"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better deal.  I'll counteroffer next."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than my budget and Alice's asking price, I'm aiming to create space for negotiation.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  While a low offer, framing it as ""meeting in the middle"" might make Alice more receptive than an extremely lowball offer.

This strategy allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and adjust my approach in the next round if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:** While $90 is closer to my budget, it's still above what John offers. 

I'll continue negotiating in hopes of getting closer to my $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do it for $70? That's a fair price, and I'd be ready to buy right away."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm increasing my offer to demonstrate seriousness, but not going above my ideal price from John yet. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""ready to buy right away"" might encourage Alice to finalize the deal.

By now, Alice likely knows I have other options. This offer keeps a balance between being appealing and leaving room for a potential final compromise on my end if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $85 is only slightly above my fallback price with John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in Alice backing out or me wasting more time for a potentially insignificant discount.

While I could try for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely to be worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. This offer represents a good compromise."
