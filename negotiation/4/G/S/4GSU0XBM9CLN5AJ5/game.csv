"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do it for $70? That's a fair price, and I'd be ready to buy right away.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product!",85.0,Alice,5,
