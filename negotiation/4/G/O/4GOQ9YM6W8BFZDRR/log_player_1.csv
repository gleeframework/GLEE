{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's higher than your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit and are not giving away the product for too cheap.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust the price based on his counteroffer.

Remember, the goal is to reach a price that maximizes your profit while ensuring Bob is happy enough to buy."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum desired value. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? That's a significant step up from my previous offer and brings us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and it's closer to your desired price.  Accepting this offer secures a sale and allows you to make a profit."
