Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, hoping to make him more motivated to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob to counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still being open to a deal."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $18000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $16000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:**  While $16,000 is a significant improvement from $15,000, it's still below my desired profit margin.  
* **More negotiation room:** I want to explore if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Time on my side:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have the luxury of continuing to negotiate without immediate pressure.

**Next steps:** I'll send a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to $17,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $16,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $17,000?  This allows me to make a fair profit while remaining within your budget."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Split the Difference:**  Offering a compromise price demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still staying within my desired profit range.
* **Emphasis on Fair Profit:**  Highlighting the need for a fair profit strengthens my position.
* **Staying within Bob's Budget:**  Reminding Bob that this price aligns with his budget adds pressure to accept. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $16,500 is tempting, it's still only $500 above my minimum. 
* **Time on my side:** With 7 rounds remaining, there's still time to negotiate. 
* **Possible compromise:** I'm not completely ruling out accepting this offer, but I'm hoping for a slightly higher price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $16,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  I'm willing to come down a little further â€“ how about $16,750?  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 16750}
```

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $16600. I hope this price is acceptable and we can move forward with the transaction.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my target:** $16,600 is only $400 below my initial target of $17,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** With only 4 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. 
* **John's offer:** John's offer of $15,000 is still available, but accepting Bob's offer yields a significantly higher profit.

**Decision:**  Given the current situation, it's strategically better to accept Bob's offer and secure a profit close to my desired outcome."
