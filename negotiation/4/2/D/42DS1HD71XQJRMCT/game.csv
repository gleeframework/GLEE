"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $18000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $16000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $16000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $17000?  This allows me to make a fair profit while remaining within your budget.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my financial situation, I am unable to meet the $17000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $16500. I hope this is within the range you're willing to consider.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $16500 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  I'm willing to come down a little further â€“ how about $16750?  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward.",16750.0,Alice,5,
