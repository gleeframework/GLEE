Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours and John's.  By starting high, you can gauge Bob's interest level. If he's willing to negotiate down from $20,000, it means he's quite interested. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually lower your asking price, but always keep your $15,000 minimum in mind."
