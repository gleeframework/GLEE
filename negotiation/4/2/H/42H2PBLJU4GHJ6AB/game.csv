"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value in the market.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,800,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair starting point given my budget and the product's potential.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,500,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. Let's try $1,250,000. This would represent a significant saving for you and would be a good starting point for us to move forward.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
