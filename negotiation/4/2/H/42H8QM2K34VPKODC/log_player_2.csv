Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $7,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is the highest you can go, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you at $7,250. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $7,000.  At this point, John's offer of $8,000 is a better deal, even if it means not getting a lower price from Alice."
