"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $7,500.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $7,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $7,000 is the highest you can go, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you at $7,250. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",7250.0,Alice,5,
