"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly more than the $8,000 it's worth to her. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, bringing you closer to your goal of saving money."
