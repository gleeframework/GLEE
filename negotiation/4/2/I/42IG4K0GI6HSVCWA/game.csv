,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make a deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
