"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? It's a fair price for a great product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $12,500? It's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to make a profit.",12500.0,Alice,5,
