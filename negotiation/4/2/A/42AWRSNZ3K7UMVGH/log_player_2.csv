"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $10,000, Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is too high.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for further compromise while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his maximum willingness to pay. Bob should continue to negotiate, hoping to get the price even lower. There's still potential for Alice to lower the price, especially since John is offering the product for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering $10,000, which is his maximum budget. He's essentially matching John's price. This puts pressure on Alice to either accept the offer or risk losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is only $200 lower than John's price. It's not a significant enough discount to justify continuing negotiations.  Bob should buy the product from John at his maximum budget of $10,000 to avoid further haggling."
