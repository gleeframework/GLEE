"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, making it clear that this is a good deal for him. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation Dynamics:** This is a starting point. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, keeping in mind the value of the product to me and the possibility of selling to John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by starting high, but it could pay off if Bob is willing to negotiate. 
* **Time Factor:**  I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to be patient and see how the negotiations play out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Given the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my ideal price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired $1,000,000.  By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm not ready to give up on potentially securing a higher price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price between Bob's offer of $950,000 and my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm aware of the 10-round limit, but I'm still early in the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective,  $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my investment in it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise price, halfway between Bob's offer of $950,000 and my minimum of $1,000,000. This shows that I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him and my own investment in it to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm hoping to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Time Management:** I'm still early in the negotiation process and have several rounds left.  
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still committed to finding a price that works for both of us. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $975,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is a slight improvement from his previous offer, but it's still below my desired price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $1,000,000. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation process and potentially push for a higher price in the next round.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm not ready to give up on potentially securing a higher price with Bob. The deal with John is still my fallback option.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price that is closer to my desired price of $1,000,000 but still reflects the negotiation progress made. 
* **Time Management:** I'm aware of the 10-round limit, but I still have several rounds to work with."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you coming up a little.  To be honest, I'm still pretty close to my minimum price point.  To make this work for me,  I need to be at $995,000. That's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm hopeful we can close the deal on this offer."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the price by a smaller amount than before, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying close to my minimum.
* **Urgency:** I'm suggesting that we're getting close to the ""minimum"" price point, subtly implying time pressure.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm focusing on a positive outcome and the ""fairness"" of the price, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Gradual Approach:**  I'm slowly increasing the price, hoping to find a point where Bob is willing to accept.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still holding on to John's offer as a safety net, but I'm trying to maximize my profits with Bob.
* **Time Management:** I have five rounds remaining, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'll try one last time to find common ground. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $980,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has made a final offer of $980,000, which is very close to my desired price.
* **Time Pressure:** With only four rounds remaining, the pressure is increasing to secure a deal.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer still allows me to earn a significant amount of money.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While I'd love to get $1,000,000, there's no guarantee that I can reach that price with Bob. 

**Decision:**

I've decided to accept Bob's offer of $980,000. This is a good deal considering the value of the product to me and the time constraints. It's important to balance my desire for the maximum price with the risk of not closing a deal at all."
