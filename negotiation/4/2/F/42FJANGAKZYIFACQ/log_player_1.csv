Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is positive and confident, aiming to create a sense of value and urgency.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially start a negotiation. 

This approach allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get as close to it as possible.
* **Test Bob's interest:** I'm gauging his willingness to pay a high price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I can adjust the price downwards if Bob's counteroffers are reasonable.

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is interested in the product, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if needed. This strengthens my position for future negotiation.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer that's more in line with my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $14,000, which is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Reasoning:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Open-ended question:** The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to continue the conversation.

By offering a counteroffer, I aim to:

* **Find a middle ground:** I'm trying to reach a price that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Show flexibility:** My counteroffer demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Maintain control:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but am also not walking away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go up to $12000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price for the product. 
* **No need for further negotiation:**  There's no point in rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate.  I've reached my target price.
* **Selling to Bob is the best option:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum desired price.

It's important to note that selling to John for $12,000 would be an equally acceptable outcome. However,  since Bob has offered my minimum price, accepting his offer is the more strategic choice in this scenario."
