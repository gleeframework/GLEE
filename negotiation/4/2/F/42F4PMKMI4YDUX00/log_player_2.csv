"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be of significant value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a little to $12,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet halfway! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $12,000.** This is a good price for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **It's better than John's offer of $15,000.** 
* **It's likely Alice won't go lower.** She already lowered her price from $13,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible option."
