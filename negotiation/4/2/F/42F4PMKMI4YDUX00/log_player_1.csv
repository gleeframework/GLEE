{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be of significant value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob, which might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $13,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a little to $12,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
