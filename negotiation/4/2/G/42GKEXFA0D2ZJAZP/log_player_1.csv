Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects the potential benefits you'll receive. I'm asking for $1,000,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Please consider my offer carefully."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This creates a potential win-win situation.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob and positions the price as a fair compromise. It encourages him to consider the offer carefully.

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Maximizes potential gain:** If Bob accepts the offer, I make a profit of $200,000. 
* **Minimizes risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable value.

By offering a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value, I increase the chance of a sale while still securing a substantial profit."
