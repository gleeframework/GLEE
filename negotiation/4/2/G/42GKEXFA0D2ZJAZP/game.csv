"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $800000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects the potential benefits you'll receive. I'm asking for $1000000. This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Please consider my offer carefully.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
