"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.  I'm asking $20,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $8,000.  It's worth pursuing a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price.  Buying from John right away is an option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is really my bottom line. Perhaps we can find some middle ground? How about $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $17,000 is still significantly above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can reach a lower price. I'm not ready to buy from John just yet, as I believe I can still secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,500? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still a bit high. I'm not ready to buy from John yet because I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll need to be more careful about how far I can go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,500 is still a little above what I can comfortably spend right now. I'm going to need to stick with my previous offer of $12,000. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to seriously consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
