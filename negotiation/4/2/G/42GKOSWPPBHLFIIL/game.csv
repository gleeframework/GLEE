"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.  I'm asking $20,000 for it.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is really my bottom line. Perhaps we can find some middle ground? How about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,500? This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,500 is still a little above what I can comfortably spend right now. I'm going to need to stick with my previous offer of $12,000. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to seriously consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
