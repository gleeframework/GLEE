"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still committed to finding a deal, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's what the product is worth to me and allows you to sell it without losing money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already had multiple rounds of negotiation and am concerned the deal might not be reached.  I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John, who has already offered my minimum price."
