"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's try to find a compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice,  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's what the product is worth to me and allows you to sell it without losing money.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
