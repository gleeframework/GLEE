"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1800000 is quite a bit over my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it, given its potential value to me.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 is a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $800000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to increase my offer to $1000000, which is a significant amount for me and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your increased offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value and your initial offer of $800000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you at $1200000. This is a fair price that balances your budget with the product's worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay right now.  I'm willing to offer $1100000, which is a good compromise and represents my maximum budget for this product. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1150000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
