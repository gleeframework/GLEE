Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the purchase."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,500 gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves a small margin for potential haggling.
* **Don't undervalue:**  We know Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it significantly lower than $14,500 might raise suspicion or undervalue the product.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the sale with Bob at a favorable price and ensuring you don't lose out on the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
