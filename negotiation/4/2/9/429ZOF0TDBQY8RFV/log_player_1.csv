Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum value of $8,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell it to John if his counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is the best option for maximizing profit in this situation."
