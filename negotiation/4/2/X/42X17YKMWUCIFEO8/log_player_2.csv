"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($12,000). There's room for negotiation, and I want to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I was hoping to get closer to the value it holds for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my desired price of $13,000 and still gives Alice a decent profit.  Accepting this offer saves me $1,500 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially sound decision at this point."
