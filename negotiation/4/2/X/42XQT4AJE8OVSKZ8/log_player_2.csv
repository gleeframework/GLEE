"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to work with you. After reviewing your budget, we're willing to offer you the product at a price of $9000. We believe this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is closer to his $8,000 limit, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm getting. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at a price of $8750. We believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is only $750 more than Bob's maximum budget from John.  While there is still room for negotiation, Bob's goal is to buy the product and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer exists. It's more advantageous to accept the offer now and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
