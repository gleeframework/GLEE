It's too expensive.  You're better off trying to negotiate with Alice or buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is the maximum you are willing to pay, as you can buy the product from John for that price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
