"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the market value of similar products, but I believe my product is truly unique and worth more.

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you believe your product is unique, but I still think $1400000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1350000. I understand this is still a compromise, but I believe the product's value is worth the extra $50000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to negotiating further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1325000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope you can understand that I need to stay within my budget. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1500000.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
