"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still outside my range.  Let's split the difference and go with $112.50. That's fair to both of us, and it would get us closer to a deal.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, so I can offer it to you for $117.50. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal soon.",117.5,Alice,5,
