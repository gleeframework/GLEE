Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is above my minimum of $120, leaving some room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point to see if Bob is interested in the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While I can accept his offer and secure a sale, it's too far below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $130. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. It shows flexibility while trying to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and while I would prefer to get more, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
