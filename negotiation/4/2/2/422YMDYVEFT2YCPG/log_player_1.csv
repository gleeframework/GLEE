Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you aim to get as much as possible from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 gives room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes value to Bob rather than focusing solely on price. 

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation.  In a real scenario, there might be back and forth, allowing you to adjust your offer based on Bob's reactions."
