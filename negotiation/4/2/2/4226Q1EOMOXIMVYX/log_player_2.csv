"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $120 is a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We start by offering Alice her value for the product. This is a reasonable starting point and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good. Let's try pushing a little further down, but we need to be mindful of John's price now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $115 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $105."",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to a price that works for us while still leaving some room for negotiation before hitting John's $150 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $105, which is $110. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met us in the middle, and $110 is a good price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer gets us a good discount from John's price."
