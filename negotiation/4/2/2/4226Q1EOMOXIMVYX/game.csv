"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $115 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $105.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $105, which is $110. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
