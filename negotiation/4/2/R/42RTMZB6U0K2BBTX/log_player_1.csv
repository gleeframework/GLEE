"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but not so high that it scares Bob away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$120 is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175.  This is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum, but still gives me a decent profit.  Hopefully, it's appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but it's still above my minimum and leaves room for some potential negotiation. Hopefully, Bob sees that I'm willing to be flexible but also determined to get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum.  While I could continue negotiating, the time is running out and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with. Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit, and it's better than potentially getting a worse offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
