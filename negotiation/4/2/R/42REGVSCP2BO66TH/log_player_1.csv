Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for a price closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too aggressive could make Bob reject the offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and fairness of the offer.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant amount above your minimum but leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still getting a great deal.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You have the advantage of knowing your walk-away point ($1,200,000 from John).
* **Relationship:** While you want to maximize profit, consider the long-term implications. If a strong relationship with Bob is valuable, a slightly less aggressive opening price might be strategic."
