"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $15,500?  That's still a fair price for the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $14,250? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",14250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $14,250 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $14,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",14750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $14,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14,000? That's the best I can do.",14000.0,Bob,6,
