"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $1300000, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, and that's my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,10,
