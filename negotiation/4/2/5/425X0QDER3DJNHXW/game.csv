"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me while also giving you a good profit margin.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $775,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit margin.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000. This price reflects the value of the product for me, while also allowing for a fair profit margin for you. I'm confident this offer is a good deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Alice,5,
