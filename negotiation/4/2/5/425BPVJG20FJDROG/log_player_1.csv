"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm starting with a price of $175, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $175, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Showing flexibility:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has a chance to get a good deal. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly tone can make Bob more receptive to the offer and potentially more open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $150 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I have a minimum value of $150 for the product.  Bob's offer is right at my minimum, and I'm aiming for more.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Since this is only round 2,  I have several rounds left to try and secure a higher price.
* **Understanding Bob's limits:** Bob's offer shows me his perceived value, which will help me craft a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down to $160, but I'm confident this product is worth more. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain value:**  $160 is still above my minimum price, allowing me to earn more than selling to John.
* **Positive language:**  I use positive language to encourage Bob and keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Focus on value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, hoping to encourage him to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to offer $150 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, meaning I have fewer rounds left to reach a higher price.
* **Stalemate:** Bob is firmly sticking to his $150 offer.  I've already lowered my price, and further concessions might not be fruitful.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $150, which is the same as Bob's offer.  I don't want to risk losing money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
