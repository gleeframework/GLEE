"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That gives us both a fair deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $105. How about we try $107.50? Can you meet me at that price?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. But $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $112.50? This is closer to my price, and it's still a good deal for you.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer of $112.50. How about we try $111? Can you meet me at that price?,111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm starting to feel like we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go down to $115, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",110.0,Bob,8,
