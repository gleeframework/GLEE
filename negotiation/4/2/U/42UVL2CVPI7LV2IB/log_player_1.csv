"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to be assertive but also willing to compromise, especially since John is a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's important to hold firm and try to negotiate a better deal.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above $105.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $105. How about we try $107.50? Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $107.5 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's important to hold firm and try to negotiate a better deal. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. But $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $112.50? This is closer to my price, and it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer of $112.50. How about we try $111? Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $111 is getting closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm starting to feel like we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go down to $115, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough choice, but with only two rounds left, I need to prioritize my minimum acceptable price. $110 is still below my $120 goal, and with limited time to negotiate, I'm better off taking John's offer and ensuring I get my minimum."
