"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm offering $75 for the product. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise. $82.50 is still a little higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $78. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $80, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
