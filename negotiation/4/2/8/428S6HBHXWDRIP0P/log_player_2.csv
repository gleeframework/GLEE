Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us.

# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. How about we meet at $9,250? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for you.

Alice seems to be moving in the wrong direction! It's clear she's not going to budge much closer to a reasonable price.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $12,000."
