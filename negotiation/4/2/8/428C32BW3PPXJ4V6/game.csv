"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. Let me know if that works for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a little too high.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $11,500. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,750. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,
