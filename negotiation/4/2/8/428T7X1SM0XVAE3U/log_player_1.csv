Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $80? That's my absolute top end for this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $80 is too low for me, and I think I can get more if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget.  $80 is just too low for me to accept. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you working with me on this. $115 is still a bit too high for me. I can go up to $95, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105.  This is a fair price that's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $105 is still over my budget. I can go up to $98, which is a fair compromise and closer to my limit. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I've already had 5 rounds of negotiation and haven't reached a mutually agreeable price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
