"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1080000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that this is the best price for the product. I've done some further research and I'm confident that the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000, which is $20000 above your latest offer.
