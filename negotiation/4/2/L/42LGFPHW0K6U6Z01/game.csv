"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's a good compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,500 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750? This price would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let me know what you think.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  But I appreciate you working with me.  How about $12,000 even?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
