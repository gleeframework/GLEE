"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is quite high, close to your maximum budget. There's significant room for negotiation. It's in your best interest to reject this initial offer and present a counteroffer that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $9,000 is a significant jump from Alice's opening offer, it gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how much Alice is willing to come down on the price. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the backup option of buying from John for $12,000, so there's less risk in starting with a lower counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $10,500 is still significantly higher than both your target price and Alice's perceived value of the product.
* **Maintain Momentum:** Rejecting this offer shows Alice you're serious about getting a better deal and encourages her to make further concessions. 
* **Time Consideration:** You have several rounds left, so there's no need to settle prematurely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're trying to find a fair middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle on $9,750?  That feels like a reasonable compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to move closer to her price, but not without significant movement on her end as well.
* **Staying Competitive:** While $9,750 is still a good deal for you, it's getting closer to a price point where Alice might be more agreeable. 
* **Time Management:** As you progress through the rounds, it's good to start narrowing the gap to increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close the gap - $10,100, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:**  Alice is lowering her price, but in relatively small increments. This suggests there's still room for her to move.
* **Target Price in Sight:** You're getting closer to your ideal price range. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if you can get closer to $9,500. 
* **Maintaining Position:** By continuing to reject offers slightly above your target, you maintain a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we make it $9,800 and call it a deal?  That's a strong offer, and it would allow us to wrap this up quickly."",
""product_price"": 9800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:**  A $50 decrease from your previous offer signals a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning a quick resolution might encourage Alice to accept, especially if she's eager to complete the sale.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer keeps the negotiation moving forward while staying below $10,000, a psychological price point that might be harder to break through."
