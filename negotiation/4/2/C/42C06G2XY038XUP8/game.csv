"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go right now. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $108. Can you consider that price?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $108 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $108, and I'm starting to think that buying from John for $100 might be a better option. Can you meet me at $108 or lower?",108.0,Bob,6,
