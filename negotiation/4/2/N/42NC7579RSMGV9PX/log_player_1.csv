Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 from John, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point, especially considering the potential value of the product to Bob is unknown. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll move on to John and secure the minimum price. However, I hope Bob recognizes the value of the product and is willing to pay a premium to acquire it."
