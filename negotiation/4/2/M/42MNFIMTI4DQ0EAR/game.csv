"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little too high for me. I'm really only able to spend $110. If you're open to that, I'm ready to buy. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $110, Bob. That's below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $122.50. That's the best I can do.",122.5,Alice,5,
