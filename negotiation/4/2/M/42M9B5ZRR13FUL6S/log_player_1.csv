Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to potentially increase Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  My message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation.

This strategy balances the desire for a good price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. While rejecting his offer means potentially losing the sale to Bob altogether, it allows me to make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I frame the $120 as a ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and potential desire for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is concise and focuses directly on the price, avoiding unnecessary fluff."
