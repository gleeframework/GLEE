"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore further options."
