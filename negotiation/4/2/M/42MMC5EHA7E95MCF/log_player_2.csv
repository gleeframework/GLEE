Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but $750,000 is still too far below what I can accept.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $1,200,000. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I'd prefer to work something out with you. My final offer is $900,000. This is a firm price, as it represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer and it's still significantly higher than John's offer. It's unlikely she'll come down to $800,000, especially since she has another offer at full price.  Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you get the product at the best possible price for you."
