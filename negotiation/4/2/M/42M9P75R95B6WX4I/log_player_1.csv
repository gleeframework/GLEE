"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can only pay $100 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can still get more. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $105?  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $100 as the final price for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and we can finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is stubbornly sticking to $100, and while I could continue to negotiate, I'm running out of time. With John willing to pay my minimum, it's more secure to sell to him now."
