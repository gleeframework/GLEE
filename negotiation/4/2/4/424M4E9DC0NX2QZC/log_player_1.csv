"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand your initial price, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $150 for this item. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. Selling to John would give me the same amount, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the minimum I want and saves time."
