Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for the possibility of earning an extra $500.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price well above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) would likely lead to immediate rejection.  $11,500 positions the offer as a potential bargain compared to my backup offer while still being a substantial profit for me.
* **Open Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but not entirely sold at $11,500."
