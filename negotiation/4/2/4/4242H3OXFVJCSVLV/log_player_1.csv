Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is impossible unless one of you changes your valuation. 

**The Strategy**

Since a mutually beneficial deal seems impossible, your best bet is to aim for the highest price Bob might *consider* before walking away.  

Here's the offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,199,999. This offer is time-sensitive, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1199999}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by emphasizing the product's exclusivity and value.
* **Pricing Strategy:** You price the product just below Bob's perceived value, creating the illusion of a ""deal.""
* **Time Pressure:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though John's offer is your safety net), you create urgency for Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While this offer maximizes your potential gains from Bob, it's highly likely he will reject it. Be prepared to sell the product to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000."
