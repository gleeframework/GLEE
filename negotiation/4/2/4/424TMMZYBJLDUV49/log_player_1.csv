Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000, giving me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still hoping to get a higher price than my minimum, but I'm also showing flexibility to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum and I've already made concessions. I don't think there's much room for further negotiation, and John is offering me my minimum. It's time to sell to John and avoid any further risk of getting a worse deal."
