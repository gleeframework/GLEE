"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as I believe you could really benefit from it. I think a price of $14,000 feels fair. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $10,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $12,250 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is too low for me. I could come down to $11,750, which is my final offer.  This product is worth the investment, and I wouldn't want you to miss out on it.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate that this is your final offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I can do $11,250, but I can't go any higher.",11250.0,Bob,6,
