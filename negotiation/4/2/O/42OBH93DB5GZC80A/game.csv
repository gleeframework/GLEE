"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a little wiggle room.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? That way, we both get a fair deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
