Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why 1,150,000?** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It also leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately alienate Bob.
* **Why not start higher?** While I could start at a higher price, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting my offer outright. 
* **Why not start lower?** Starting too low could leave too much money on the table. 
* **Why John?** John acts as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure a good price by selling to John. 

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiations. I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's valuation of $1,200,000 as possible, while ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,100,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** There's still room for a counteroffer to reach a price that's more favorable to me.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I continue the negotiation process and have the opportunity to secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my initial offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Reasonable profit:** This price still allows me to earn a significant profit while being closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I maintain some leverage in the negotiation and show that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.

This counteroffer is intended to create a sense of urgency for Bob to reach a deal, while still securing a favorable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer matches my initial offer:** This is a good outcome for me as I am able to secure a price that is within my desired range.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Bob's offer is already closer to my desired price, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.
* **Risk of losing a good deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations, there's a chance that Bob might walk away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer.

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a worse outcome."
