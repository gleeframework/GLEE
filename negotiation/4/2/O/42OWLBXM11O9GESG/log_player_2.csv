{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer is way too high. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point, given my maximum value for the product."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to reject and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer to $110.  This is getting closer to my maximum value, but I believe there is still room for Alice to come down a bit more."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm going to continue negotiating. There's still a gap between her price and my maximum value, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $115. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping Alice will finally accept. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging much from her price, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $120, as it's a better deal than what Alice is offering."
