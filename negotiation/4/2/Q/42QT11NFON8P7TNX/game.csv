"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! After considering your interest, I'd like to make you an offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000, but that's still a bit outside my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $950,000.  This is a fair price given the value to me, and it would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not able to go above $975,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find a solution here.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'll make one more counteroffer at $1,015,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
