Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider it?

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which still leaves room for a profit for both of us. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. He's consistently coming in below my minimum, and the negotiation seems to be getting more difficult.  John is offering me my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him."
