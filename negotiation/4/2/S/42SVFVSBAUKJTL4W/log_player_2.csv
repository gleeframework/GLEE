Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. He should try to negotiate further to get a better deal."

Bob is offering $15,000, which is his maximum price. This is the point where he's no longer willing to negotiate lower. If Alice doesn't accept, he'll buy from John for the same price."
