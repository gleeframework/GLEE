"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You can get the product for $100 from John, and Alice's offer is $95, which is still more than your maximum budget. It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
