"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its potential worth.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle; how about $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a compromise.  I'm really only able to go up to $8,500.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,250? This would be a fair compromise.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a good compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",8750.0,Bob,6,
