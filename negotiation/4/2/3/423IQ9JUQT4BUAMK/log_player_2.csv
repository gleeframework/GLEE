"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is far above his budget and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle; how about $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's already stated he's willing to pay $8,000 and Alice is unwilling to go lower than $10,000.  While Bob could technically accept, he's better off continuing the negotiation to see if he can get closer to his desired price, or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a compromise.  I'm really only able to go up to $8,500.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,250? This would be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's stated a firm price of $8,500 and Alice is still above that. While this is closer to his budget, it is still more than he wants to pay. It is unlikely Alice will come down further, and Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a good compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
