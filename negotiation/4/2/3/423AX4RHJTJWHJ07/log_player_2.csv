"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let's start the negotiation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's therefore a good idea to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. It also creates a clear starting point for further negotiation.
* **Justified Offer:** $750,000 is still a substantial amount and leaves room for compromise while remaining within Bob's budget. 
* **Open to Compromise:** The message emphasizes a willingness to find a solution that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is significantly below the value of the product to me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still provides me with a fair return while allowing you to acquire a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is Still Too High:**  $850,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and Bob can use this to his advantage by pushing for a lower price.
* **Potential to Save Money:** There's a good chance that Bob can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Buying from John at this point would cost Bob more than it might if he continues to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  By offering $825,000, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway while still staying within his budget.
* **Appealing to Alice's Needs:**  The message emphasizes fairness and meeting both parties' needs, which can make Alice more receptive to the offer. 
* **Building Momentum:**  This counteroffer shows continued progress in the negotiation. If Alice rejects it, Bob can still push for a better price in the next round."
