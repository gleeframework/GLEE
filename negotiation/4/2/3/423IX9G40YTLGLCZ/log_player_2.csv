"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better deal than $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He has 10 rounds to try, and the option to buy from John for $8,000 if needed.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than his maximum price. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to negotiate a good deal. The price of $8,500 is a compromise that allows for potential negotiation while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but Bob is still within his budget.  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to see if he can get Alice to drop her price further.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now closer to his target price of $8,000 but wants to keep some room for negotiation. A counter-offer of $9,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price."
