"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but it's not too high that it would scare Bob away immediately. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$70 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $100. I'm not going to accept that offer.  I'll reject it and see if Bob is willing to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120. It's still above my minimum value, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is still below my minimum value. I'm not satisfied with that offer, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll continue negotiating with Bob. I think there's still potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $110. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum value.  I'm hoping this price will be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offers, I'm still not satisfied. I'm not ready to give up on a higher price yet, and I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. It's just above my minimum value of $100 and it demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will finally recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds and Bob isn't budging much. I've already lowered my price significantly and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum value. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $100."
