"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $999000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this item. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $875000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If you're serious about selling this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $825000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to sell the product at that price.

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $840000, which is very close to my budget and represents a significant compromise from my previous offer. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",840000.0,Bob,6,
