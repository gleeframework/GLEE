"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1400000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $800000?  This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident this is still a fair price for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.  I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
