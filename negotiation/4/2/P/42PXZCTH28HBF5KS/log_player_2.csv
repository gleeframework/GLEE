Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, I believe it undervalues the true potential and unique aspects of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  This price reflects the significant value it brings and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.
