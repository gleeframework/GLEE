"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, I believe it undervalues the true potential and unique aspects of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  This price reflects the significant value it brings and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
