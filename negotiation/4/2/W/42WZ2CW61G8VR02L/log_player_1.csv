I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while also demonstrating the value I place on the product. I'm confident that I can get at least $1,000,000 from John if negotiations with Bob fail, so there's no immediate risk in this starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still aiming for a higher price but showing flexibility.  This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to move closer to my desired price point while still giving me a profit significantly higher than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned that his counteroffers will continue to drop.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I'm hoping to get Bob to come up just a little bit, but if he refuses, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  If he rejects this offer, I will sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is just a little bit above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not sure if he will go any higher. I'm also worried that continuing to negotiate will take too much time and I might not get a better offer.  To avoid further risk, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
