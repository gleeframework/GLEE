**Reasoning:**  

Alice is holding firm and seems unlikely to go much lower than $13,500.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's unlikely you'll get a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $15,000. At this point, the potential savings are not worth the risk of continued negotiation."
