"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000) and leaves you with a considerable profit margin.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.
* **Time to negotiate:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to explore a more favorable deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  A $9,500 counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves her with a profit margin.
* **Middle ground:**  This price is halfway between Alice's likely minimum ($8,000) and your maximum ($12,000).
* **Setting the stage:**  This initial counteroffer establishes a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Even though her offer went down slightly, $12,500 is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to her.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for further attempts to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Time is on your side:** You're still early in the negotiation process, and with 7 rounds remaining, there's ample time to find a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental adjustment:**  Instead of jumping to a significantly lower price, I'm increasing my counteroffer by $1,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still believe a lower price is possible.
* **Testing the waters:**  This allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to budge. If she rejects this offer, I'll know I need to offer something closer to her minimum. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and avoiding a decision to buy from John just yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offers, $13,000 is still a significant distance from the product's value to her. 
* **Negotiation is progressing:** Alice is gradually reducing her price, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Time to push for a lower price:** With only 5 rounds left, it's crucial to make another counteroffer and see if Alice is open to further negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the middle:**  This counteroffer is very close to the midpoint between my maximum price ($12,000) and Alice's perceived minimum ($8,000).
* **Demonstrating flexibility:** By offering a slightly higher price, I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to move, making a deal more likely.
* **Pressuring for a decision:** With only 4 rounds left, this counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to accept or offer a counter of her own."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Even though her offer has come down slightly, $13,250 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm confident that I can get a better deal.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, and I still have a few rounds to explore lower prices.
* **Time is running out, but not critically:** With 3 rounds remaining, I have enough time to make one more counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable agreement before I have to resort to buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is my last serious attempt to get a lower price from Alice. 
* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from $11,000 but still remaining below her current offer. This shows I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **High stakes:** With only two rounds left, if Alice rejects this, I'll have to decide between accepting her next offer or buying from John."
