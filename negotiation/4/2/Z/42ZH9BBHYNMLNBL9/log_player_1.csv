Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts in the middle of the possible price range, giving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than what Alice initially offered, it's still above her minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit."
