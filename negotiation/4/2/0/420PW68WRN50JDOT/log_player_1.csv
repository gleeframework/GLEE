"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** By starting at $120, I'm giving Bob a clear incentive to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Bob's offer of $100 is still significantly below the product's worth to him ($150).  This means there's still room for a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm going to reject the offer and counteroffer to get closer to a price that reflects the product's true value.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  While I can sell to John for $80, I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By offering $110, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $100 to him.
* **Creating Urgency:** The ""fair price"" language suggests that I'm open to negotiating, but also hints that I might be willing to walk away if the price doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still secure a better deal.  
* **Testing the Limits:** By rejecting, I'm testing how far Bob is willing to go. 
* **John as a Backstop:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $80 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However,  $105 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $108. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm offering a small increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  The ""fair compromise"" language reinforces the idea that I'm being reasonable.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $108 is still significantly higher than my minimum of $80.

**Overall Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to gradually close the gap with Bob while maintaining a price point that's beneficial for me. 
* My goal is to get as close to $110 as possible before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $108 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $105.50 is very close to my previous offer of $108. This signals a strong likelihood that he's genuinely interested in the product and willing to pay close to my asking price.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're now in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds before I have to consider selling to John.  
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $110, accepting this offer ensures a profit well above my minimum of $80 and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Overall Strategy:**

I'm prioritizing securing a sale at a reasonable price, rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing out to John.  $105.50 is a good compromise, especially considering the limited number of rounds remaining."
