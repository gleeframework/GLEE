"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth much more than that to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially save money.  It's too early to buy from John, as you might get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by significantly reducing the price. It demonstrates your interest in the product but also establishes your budget constraints.  This gives Alice room to counter without immediately going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $1100000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget. You should continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  You are closer to John's price, but it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your $900,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great way to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer bridges the gap between your previous offer and Alice's current offer.  It also positions you right at John's price, putting pressure on Alice to make a decision.  If Alice rejects this offer, you can move to John with confidence."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm thinking of a price around $1080000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than John's price. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of going through more rounds is not worth the potential savings. You can guarantee a purchase within your budget by going with John."
