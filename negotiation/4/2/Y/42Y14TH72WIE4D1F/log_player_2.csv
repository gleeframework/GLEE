"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the price, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. How about $13,000? I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $13,500. This is a $1,500 discount, which is significant.
* **Alice's Value:** Alice is willing to sell for $13,500, which is above her own value of $12,000. This means she still sees value in the deal.
* **Risk of Counter-offering:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, and the risk is that the negotiation will drag on, potentially leading to a point where Bob might have to buy from John for the full $15,000.

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer at $13,500 is the best strategy for Bob as it balances a significant discount with a reasonable likelihood of closing the deal."
