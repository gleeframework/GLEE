"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value. I'm confident it's a good deal for you, but I'm also open to hearing your thoughts and potential counteroffers.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential,  $1000000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $750000. This would allow me to make the investment while still leaving room for potential negotiation on my end. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see your point about the price. However, $750000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle to make this deal work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
