"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value. I'm confident it's a good deal for you, but I'm also open to hearing your thoughts and potential counteroffers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum budget. There's no immediate reason to accept. By rejecting, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price, potentially saving money. Buying from John right away offers no advantage, as you're already at your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $750,000. This would allow me to make the investment while still leaving room for potential negotiation on my end. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see your point about the price. However, $750000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,000,000 to $900,000, which is a significant reduction and a good price for me.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting and me having to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting her offer secures the product at a good price."
