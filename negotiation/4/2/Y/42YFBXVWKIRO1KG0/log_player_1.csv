Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still getting a decent price for the product. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter his offer, keeping in mind John's offer of $100 as my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's closer to my floor price than my initial offer, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial $140, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $132.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my floor price of $100.  Further negotiation could potentially get me a slightly higher price, but there's a chance of Bob rejecting again and I'm not sure how much longer he'll continue negotiating.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk getting nothing."
