"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  However, $10000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this unique item.  I'm willing to come down to $12500. This price reflects a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's continue the negotiation.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and show my commitment to the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
