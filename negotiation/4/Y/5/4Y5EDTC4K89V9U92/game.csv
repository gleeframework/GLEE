"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $850000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $920000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit.
