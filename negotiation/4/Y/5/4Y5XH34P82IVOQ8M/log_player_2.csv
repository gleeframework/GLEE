"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $100 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, but I still think it's a valuable product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. It's a great compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $120, and Alice's offer of $95 is still within his budget.
* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk:** While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might harden her stance or even walk away from the deal. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Choosing to buy from John for $120 would mean missing out on a potentially better deal with Alice.

Accepting Alice's offer at $95 represents a good compromise that saves Bob $25 compared to buying from John."
