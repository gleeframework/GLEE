"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this to me. $200 is a bit steep for my budget though. Would you consider something closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  Could you do $170?  I'm willing to negotiate a bit, but that's a fair price for this item.",170.0,Alice,3,
