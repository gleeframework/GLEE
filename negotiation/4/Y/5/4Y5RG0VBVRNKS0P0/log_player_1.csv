"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives Bob an incentive to accept, but also allows me to potentially get a better price if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's current offer and closer to my target price. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm not yet in a position to sell to John, as I'm aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer but still higher. I'm aiming to close the deal, but I'm not willing to go much lower yet."
