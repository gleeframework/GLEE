"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $950,000 is still too high, and he has room to negotiate a lower price. He has 10 rounds to work with and can potentially save a significant amount of money.  Going to John right away would be a waste of his negotiating leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000 for the product, which is $100,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This is a significant reduction, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate, while still leaving some room for further compromise. This offer is also significantly below Bob's maximum price point of $1,000,000, meaning he has more bargaining power than Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob should still reject it. He has shown a willingness to negotiate lower, and Alice has shown some flexibility in her own offers. There's still room for a deal closer to Bob's target.  He has 7 rounds left to negotiate, and buying from John now would limit his potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $875,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying below his maximum price.  This is a good middle ground that might encourage Alice to accept.  He's also acknowledging that Alice is unlikely to drop to $850,000, and this offer could potentially end the negotiation on a good note."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, Bob should accept Alice's offer.  The price is now within a reasonable range for Bob, and he's nearing his target price.  He's already shown his willingness to negotiate, and pushing for a lower price might risk the deal completely.  With 5 rounds remaining, it's a good time to secure the deal and avoid potential complications with John or further rounds of negotiation."
