"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $850,000? I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also working for my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work. This price still gives you a significant return on your investment. Let's find a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
