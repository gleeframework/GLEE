"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant $12,000 value to you. Considering this, I propose to offer it to you at a special introductory price of $11,000. This represents a fantastic opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a competitive rate. I look forward to hearing your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's offer of $12,000. However, Bob can still get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with her further. There's a chance she might lower the price to something closer to her value of $10,000."
