Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it would be worth $100 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $80, but it also gives Bob some room to negotiate. If he rejects the offer, I can still make a counteroffer. If he seems unwilling to pay more, I can always sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I think $85 would be a fair price for me to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is more than what John would pay, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $90 for the product. It's a fair compromise between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$90 is a good compromise and closer to my desired profit margin. I'm happy to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
