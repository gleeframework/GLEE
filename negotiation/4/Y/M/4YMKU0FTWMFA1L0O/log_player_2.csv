"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's better to negotiate for a lower price or consider John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message expresses continued interest while clearly stating our budget limitations. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price.  If she completely rejects this offer, we know we might need to move closer to her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is too far below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Our Target:** Alice's offer of $8,000 matches the price we can get from John and is the maximum we're willing to pay. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** Continuing the negotiation might not result in a better price, and we risk Alice increasing her offer or us missing out entirely. 
* **Saving Time and Effort:** Accepting now closes the deal and avoids further back-and-forth."
