"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still within Alice's desired profit range.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit high. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if we can get a lower price.  I'm willing to counter-offer again to see if we can find common ground."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $820,000, which is $20,000 more than your last offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my last offer, and at $820,000, the deal is within a reasonable range for me.  It's still a good saving compared to the initial price of $900,000, and even compared to John's price of $1,000,000. It's likely that further negotiations will lead to only a small reduction in price, and it's time to finalize the deal."
