Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'm not sure of Bob's valuation, so I want to see if he's serious about buying at a premium.  If he rejects, we can start negotiating down.  I'm confident I can get at least $1,000,000 from John if needed, but I'd rather get more from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a good start, but I want to see if I can push for a better price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price if we continue negotiating.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but not quite that high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway, but I'm still aiming for a good profit. I'm not going to sell to John yet as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. It's too risky to accept his offer and miss out on potentially getting closer to $1,400,000. I'll make a counteroffer, hopefully, we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm continuing to reduce my offer, but I'm still aiming for a substantial profit. I believe Bob is genuinely interested and will likely meet me halfway.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just a little above my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get closer to $1,250,000, it's risky to keep negotiating. There's a chance Bob could walk away, and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely.  $1,050,000 is still a significant profit and a good outcome for this negotiation."
