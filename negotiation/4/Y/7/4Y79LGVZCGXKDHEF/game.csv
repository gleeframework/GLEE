"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, how about we settle at $925,000? It's a small step from your last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
