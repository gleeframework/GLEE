"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you will be even greater. I'm starting with a price of $1200000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1000000 to make this work. How about $1050000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950000. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
