"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1000000 to make this work. How about $1050000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.
