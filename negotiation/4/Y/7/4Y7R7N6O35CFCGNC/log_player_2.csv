"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth $12,000 to someone like you, but to start the negotiation, I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  It's much closer to my maximum price than her own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $9,000? "",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not in a range I'm happy with.  I'll counter again to try and nudge the price closer to a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to.  How about $9,500?"",
