"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You have a significant margin to work with ($700,000 between your max price and Alice's minimum price), so rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and is still within the range of a profitable deal for both of us. It's a good starting point for negotiation, allowing for further adjustments if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's still significantly lower than John's price and closer to my target price, making it a worthwhile purchase. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially pushing the price higher is not worth it. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal within my budget."
