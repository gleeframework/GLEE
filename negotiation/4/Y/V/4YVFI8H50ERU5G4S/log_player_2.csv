"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's price ($1,300,000) is lower than John's price ($1,500,000).
* **You can still make a profit:**  Even at $1,300,000, you are getting the product for less than your maximum budget ($1,500,000) and you'll have a profit margin."
