Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.
