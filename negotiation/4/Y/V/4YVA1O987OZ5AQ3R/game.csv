"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has a lot of potential and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the product.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to move forward with the purchase.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $920,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering it to you for $890,000. This is a fair compromise that I hope you'll consider.",890000.0,Alice,5,
