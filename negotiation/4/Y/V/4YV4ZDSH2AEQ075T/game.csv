"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a stretch for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone.",750000.0,Bob,4,
