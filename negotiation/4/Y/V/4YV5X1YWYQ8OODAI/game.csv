"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something that can truly transform your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to start at a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has the potential to be valuable, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start.  I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
