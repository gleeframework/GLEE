"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something that can truly transform your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to start at a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has the potential to be valuable, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start.  I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now willing to sell at my maximum price. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal in further rounds, and it's the same price John is offering."
