Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has the potential to be valuable, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start.  I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
