"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a significantly lower price, leaving room for compromise.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you know you have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, higher than your initial offer but still lower than Alice's latest proposal. It shows you are willing to negotiate but are also firm on your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is clearly not budging much, and even at $950,000, you're still over your preferred budget.  Since John offers a better price, it's the most sensible decision to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
