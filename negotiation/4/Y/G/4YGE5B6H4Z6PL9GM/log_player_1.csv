Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob sees the product as worth $1,500,000.
* **Your Guarantee:** John acts as a safety net, ensuring you'll get at least $1,200,000.

**Negotiation Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's less than $1,500,000) while maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed sale, you can aim slightly higher than the midpoint between your minimum and Bob's value.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,380,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1380000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** Creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Price:** $1,380,000 leaves a comfortable profit margin for you ($180,000 above your minimum) while still saving Bob $120,000 compared to his perceived value. 

**Important Notes**

* **Be prepared to negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Having a clear understanding of your lowest acceptable price will help you in further discussions.
* **Consider non-financial factors:** Sometimes, factors like a quick and smooth transaction can outweigh a slightly higher price.  Be open to understanding Bob's priorities."
