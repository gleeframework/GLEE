Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too far below my minimum threshold and I can get more from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Bob further, but I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a significant amount of value for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm determined to get at least $1,000,000 and I'm willing to risk continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $975,000 is still below my minimum. Let's aim for $1,025,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. How about $1,000,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a little more, $1,000,000 is my minimum and it's a good deal. I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
