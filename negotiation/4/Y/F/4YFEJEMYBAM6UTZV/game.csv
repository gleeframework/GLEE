"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This reflects a fair price considering the value it brings to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you and the original price I was willing to accept. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to show my commitment to closing this deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
