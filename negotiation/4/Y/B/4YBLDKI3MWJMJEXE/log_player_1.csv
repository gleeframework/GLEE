Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,500."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. This is crucial information in maximizing your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $14,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It signals that you're open to discussion while still aiming for a high price.
* **Above Your Minimum:** This price is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($12,000), ensuring a good profit. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While a higher offer like $14,800 might be tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing you to sell to John for $12,000. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price that is highly advantageous to you while minimizing the risk of losing him as a buyer."
