Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While it's tempting to take $800,000, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. I still have 9 rounds to try and get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However,  $800,000 is a bit low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to show my commitment to working with you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, especially since I have 6 more rounds to work with."

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I was hoping to get a higher price from Bob, we're down to the wire and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale. John is offering a guaranteed $800,000, which is still a good deal for me, and it's better than risking getting a lower price from Bob."
