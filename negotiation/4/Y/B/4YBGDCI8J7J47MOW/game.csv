"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $12,000 falls significantly short of what I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $18,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
