"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm proposing $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I think $1,150,000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,080,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,080,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,120,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,060,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's getting very close to my bottom line. Let's wrap this up!",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
