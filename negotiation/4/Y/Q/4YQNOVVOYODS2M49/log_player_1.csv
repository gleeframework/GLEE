Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a high initial price to see if Bob is truly interested and to leave room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that John is a safety net, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still willing to hold out for more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm flexible but also determined to get a price closer to my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at a point where it's getting closer to my desired price, and I'm comfortable accepting it.  I'm not sure if I can push for much more, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether and ending up with the lower price from John."
