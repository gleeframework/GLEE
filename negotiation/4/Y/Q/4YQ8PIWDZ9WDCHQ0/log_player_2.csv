"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could greatly benefit your needs. Given its exceptional quality and features, I propose an initial price of $12000. This reflects not only the cost of production but also the value we believe it holds for customers like yourself. I look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice's initial offer is exactly that. Since there's no room for negotiation, it's more efficient to buy from John immediately. This saves you time and potential risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffers or increasing her price."
