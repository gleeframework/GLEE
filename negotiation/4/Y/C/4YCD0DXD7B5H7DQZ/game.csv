"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $160 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, though, and I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $85 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me, but $140 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $100 for the product. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $100 is still quite low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $125?  This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers.",125.0,Alice,5,
