"Alice, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. Can we discuss the possibility of a compromise at this price?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on $11,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal and both walk away happy.",12000.0,Alice,5,
