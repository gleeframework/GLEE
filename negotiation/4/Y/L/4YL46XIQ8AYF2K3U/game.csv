"Bob, I believe this product will be immensely valuable to your business.  I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000.  Given its potential, I believe that's a very fair starting point.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. To be fair, this product offers significant long-term value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, Alice, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but that's as high as I can go.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be completely transparent, $1,700,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. Would you be willing to consider $1,825,000? I'm confident this product will more than pay for itself in the long run.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but $1,825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option for me.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
