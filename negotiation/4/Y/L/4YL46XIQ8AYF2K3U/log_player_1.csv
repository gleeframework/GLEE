"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be immensely valuable to your business.  I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000.  Given its potential, I believe that's a very fair starting point."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity.
* **Confident Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob's business, we aim to anchor his perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer is significantly higher than your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This signals willingness to negotiate and prevents immediately turning Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of a loss. There's room to counter and still potentially reach a deal that's beneficial for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. To be fair, this product offers significant long-term value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** By acknowledging Bob's offer, we maintain a positive negotiation tone and show that we are open to finding common ground.
* **Holding Firm but Flexible:** The counteroffer remains above the minimum acceptable price but demonstrates a willingness to negotiate by making a substantial concession from the initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** We reiterate the product's long-term value to justify the higher price and potentially shift Bob's focus away from the short-term cost. 
* **Seeking a Middle Ground:** Proposing a price directly in the middle of the previous two offers signals a desire to reach a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is definitely serious about the product, but he's still significantly under my minimum. While I'm willing to negotiate down, I need to hold firm for now. I believe there's still room to negotiate before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be completely transparent, $1,700,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. Would you be willing to consider $1,825,000? I'm confident this product will more than pay for itself in the long run."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:**  By introducing the concept of a ""bottom line"" and hinting at the alternative buyer, we create a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Small Concession, Firm Stance:** The counteroffer is a relatively small concession, signaling that we're nearing the limit of our flexibility.  
* **Reiterating Value:** We continue to emphasize the long-term value proposition to keep Bob focused on the potential returns, not just the initial investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but $1,825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:**  Bob is clearly signaling his upper limit and even hinting at walking away. Continuing to push could make him lose interest completely. 
* **Acceptable Loss vs. Risk:** While $1,750,000 is below my initial target, it's still a significant profit. Holding out for more risks losing Bob entirely and potentially getting stuck with a longer negotiation process.  
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I can reinvest the capital sooner rather than later, which has its own inherent value."
