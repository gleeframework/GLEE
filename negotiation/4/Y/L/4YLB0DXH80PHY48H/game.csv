"Hello Alice, thanks for showcasing the product. While I recognize its value, your starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and long-term potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  Let me know if this works for you, as it's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment. While your offer is closer to what I had in mind, that final jump is substantial for me. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product. If you're willing to meet me at $1,400,000, we have a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
