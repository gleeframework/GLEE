Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and long-term potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant investment. While your offer is closer to what I had in mind, that final jump is substantial for me. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product. If you're willing to meet me at $1,400,000, we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has indicated she has another buyer and is unlikely to go much lower than $1,400,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  It makes no sense to negotiate further with Alice when you can save $400,000 by going with John."
