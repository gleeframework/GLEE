Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong bottom line.  Alice doesn't need to go below this price.

**Strategy:**

The offer aims to strike a balance between ambition and reasonableness. By starting high, Alice might secure a quick deal at a very favorable price. If Bob negotiates, Alice can slowly lower the price, gauging Bob's willingness to pay while staying above her guaranteed sale price to John."
