"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth significantly more to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's a significant gap between Alice's offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's maximum price ($1,200,000). This indicates room for negotiation and a better price for Bob.
* **No Immediate Loss:** Rejecting the offer doesn't mean losing the product.  Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price.
* **Option to Buy from John:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob has the fallback option of buying from John.

By rejecting the initial offer, Bob positions himself to potentially save a substantial amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This price still allows you to make a good profit while giving me a significant discount. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on this product.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Good Price:** $950,000 is a good price for Bob. It's significantly lower than his maximum price of $1,200,000 and gives him a substantial saving.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While it's possible to try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject the next counteroffer and the negotiation could break down. 
* **Risk of Buying from John:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer and the negotiation fails, he'll have to buy from John at a much higher price.

Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
