"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This price still allows you to make a good profit while giving me a significant discount. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on this product.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
