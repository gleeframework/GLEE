"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. Please consider this offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Please consider this counteroffer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1750000 is still beyond what I'm able to pay. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Please consider this final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
