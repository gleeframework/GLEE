Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're close to your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $11,050. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob's maximum price is $12,000.  Alice's offer of $11,050 is significantly lower than this, allowing Bob to save $950.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice has repeatedly shown a willingness to compromise. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and the increasing pressure of the limited rounds make accepting this offer a good strategic choice.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John would cost Bob $12,000, making Alice's offer the more attractive option.

Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price, minimizing potential risks and maximizing savings."
