"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product. However, $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to considering $12500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a complimentary service that's usually valued at $1000. So, the total package would be $13000 for the product plus the service. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
