# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a complimentary service that's usually valued at $1000. So, the total package would be $13000 for the product plus the service.
