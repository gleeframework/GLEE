"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $9000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $9500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $11000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9800 and $11000, which is $10400. Let's see if that's more acceptable to you.",10400.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll meet you at $10000, which is the midpoint between my original offer and your latest counteroffer. Let's see if we can finally agree on a price.",10000.0,Alice,9,
