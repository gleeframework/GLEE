{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's priced competitively. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and focuses on the value and opportunity, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob to engage in the conversation. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation and setting a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While he's shown interest, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. I'll reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, considering your interest. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  I'm acknowledging his counteroffer to show respect and build rapport.
* **Highlight the product's value:** I reiterate the product's worth, subtly reminding him of its potential value.
* **Counteroffer with reasoning:** I present a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum but still allows room for negotiation. 
* **Offer a compromise:**  I position my counteroffer as a compromise, making it more appealing and encouraging further discussion.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to keep the conversation flowing and encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This means I can accept his offer and secure a sale for a price that meets my requirements. While I could potentially push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and selling to John for $1,200,000 is only a slightly better outcome.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
