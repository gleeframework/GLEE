Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident that you'll see the potential it holds. Let's discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects its true value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:** The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to Alice, and ideally, she'd like to get more.
* **Bob's Offer:**  While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below Alice's minimum desired value.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There are still 8 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but Alice is aiming for a better deal. 

**Next Steps:** Alice will likely counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $1,200,000 but still within a range that could be acceptable to Bob."

Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is a fair price considering my initial offer and your last one.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:**  Alice is aiming for a price higher than $1,000,000.  $1,250,000 is still below her desired outcome, but closer to her minimum.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has shown some flexibility, increasing his offer to $1,250,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There are 6 rounds left, providing a decent amount of time to continue negotiating for a higher price.  
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but Alice is still motivated to get a better deal from Bob.

**Next Steps:** Alice will likely counter Bob's offer again with a price higher than $1,250,000, but still within a range that Bob might consider.  The goal is to get closer to Alice's ideal price while ensuring a deal can be made."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1275000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. Let's try to close this deal.

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has shown flexibility and increased his offer to $1,275,000, demonstrating a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, there is less opportunity to negotiate for a higher price.

**Next Steps:** Alice is likely to accept Bob's offer, as it's a good deal for her, considering the remaining rounds and the risk of losing a sale to Bob altogether."
