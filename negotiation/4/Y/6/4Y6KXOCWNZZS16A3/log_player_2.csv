"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500.  This is a great opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable item. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $9,500, which is a good deal, but you can still potentially do better.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if John will offer you a better price.  You have nothing to lose by doing so."
