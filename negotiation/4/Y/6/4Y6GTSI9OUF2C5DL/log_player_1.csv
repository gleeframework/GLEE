Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $120, which is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not aiming for the full $150 right away, as I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. 
* **Being polite:** A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response closely. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a slightly lower price, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum of $150. I'll also be mindful of John's offer, as he represents a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest and is willing to negotiate. This gives me the opportunity to counter and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, which provides a strong fallback option if the negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price point, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I will carefully consider Bob's budget constraints while aiming to secure a profit. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I can come down a bit further to $110. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've reduced my price from $120 to $110, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining a profit:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer (keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer) or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $110. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  Bob has stated that $85 is his absolute lowest price. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher offer.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob, who may not be willing to budge on his price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will sell the product to John for $150. This decision ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit while also avoiding the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who has shown a reluctance to compromise."
