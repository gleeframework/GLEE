Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to see if I can get closer to my desired price. It's also important to note that I'm leaving some room for negotiation in case Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I believe I can still get a better price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $150. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $155. This is still higher than Bob's offer of $140 but closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway.  If he doesn't, I can still sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150. While Bob's latest offer of $145 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to warrant further negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I can avoid the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer again."
