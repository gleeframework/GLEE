"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. If you decide to pass, I'll be selling it to John for $1,000,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Even though Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, it's still $50,000 less than what you'd pay John. 
* **You want to save money.**  You want to get the product for the lowest possible price."
