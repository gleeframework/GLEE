Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you have leverage. The goal is to see if Bob will pay a premium over his perceived value.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and high demand, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're aiming high to test Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""high demand"" creates perceived scarcity.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""limited-time"" and ""other interested parties"" encourages a quicker decision.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a great deal at $1,200,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer.  You have room to negotiate down to $1,000,001, knowing John is your safety net.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and secure your $1,000,000. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know Bob's financial situation or his absolute maximum willingness to pay. If you had more information, you might refine your strategy."
