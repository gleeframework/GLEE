"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  I think it would be a great asset to you. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I'm holding out for something closer to $13,000.  This product has a lot of potential and I'm confident it can bring you significant value in the long run.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and settle at $11,250? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11250.0,Alice,5,
