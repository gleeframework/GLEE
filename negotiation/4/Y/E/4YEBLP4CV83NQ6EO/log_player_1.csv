Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $1,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also increases your potential profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""unique opportunity"" subtly implies that Bob shouldn't miss out, potentially encouraging a quicker decision.

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims for maximum profit, there's always a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, having John as a backup ensures you'll still sell the product at your minimum desired price."
