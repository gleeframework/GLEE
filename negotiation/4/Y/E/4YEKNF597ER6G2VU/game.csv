"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $800000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1100000.  This is a significant reduction, and it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal with you. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800000. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $950000? This price acknowledges your budget constraints while also allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's unique qualities.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further, but $950000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000, which is a significant step for me.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can close the gap at this point.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $850000 still leaves a significant gap.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $900000? This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise. However, $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $875000. This is a fair compromise, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this transaction.",875000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $875000 is still significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about $925000?  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to finalize this deal. It's the last offer I can make, let's make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,9,
