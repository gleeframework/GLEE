Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1100000.  This is a significant reduction, and it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal with you. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $950000? This price acknowledges your budget constraints while also allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's unique qualities.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Let's see if we can close the gap at this point."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $850000 still leaves a significant gap.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $900000? This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $875,000.

Round 9

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still too high for me.  While I'd prefer to get a lower price from Alice, it's getting late in the negotiations and I'm close to my budget limit. It's time to take the sure thing with John and get the product for my target price."
