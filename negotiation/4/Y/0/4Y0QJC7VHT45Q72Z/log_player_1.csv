"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit. Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I want to get as close to that as possible. I believe Bob will likely counteroffer, allowing us to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still aiming for more.  I'm confident I can get a better price if I counteroffer.  I still have more rounds available, and selling to John is a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $9,500.  This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I would love to get even closer to my $10,000 goal, accepting his offer ensures I gain a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or even a deal with John at $10,000, which would be a loss for me."
