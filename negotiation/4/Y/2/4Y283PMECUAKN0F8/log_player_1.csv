"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives Bob a good incentive to negotiate, while also ensuring I don't give away too much value in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $10,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price that's at least above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get even closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $10,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's also a good compromise and shows that we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm accepting his offer and closing this deal."
