"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might:

* Prompt Alice to lower her price further as she's motivated to sell.
* Get closer to a price that saves you even more money."
