Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum selling price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a bit, potentially landing somewhere above our minimum. 
* **John as a Backup:**  We have the security of John's offer ($150). If Bob rejects our offer, we don't lose out. 

This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while ensuring we don't miss out on a sale entirely."
