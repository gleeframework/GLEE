{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. It's a good starting point that allows for potential negotiation and a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth. Would you consider selling it to me for $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. The product is worth $15,000 to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $14,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 14500}
