"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal today. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down significantly?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle? I could let it go for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $18,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing some real potential here for us to make a deal. $12,000 is a bit too low, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $16,000?  That's a significant reduction on my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down a bit more for this to work for me. How about $13,500?  That's a fair offer considering the market value.",13500.0,Bob,6,
