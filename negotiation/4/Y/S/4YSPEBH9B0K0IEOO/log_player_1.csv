Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal today. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down significantly?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle? I could let it go for $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing some real potential here for us to make a deal. $12,000 is a bit too low, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $16,000?  That's a significant reduction on my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down a bit more for this to work for me. How about $13,500?  That's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

While Bob is getting closer to a more reasonable price, his pace is slow and it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000 in the remaining rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John now than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable offer."
