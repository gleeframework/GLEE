"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  While I have another buyer who's willing to pay $1,500,000, I'm eager to work with you if we can find common ground. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
