(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $6,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down. This price is still above my absolute maximum of $12,000, but it leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still going to try to negotiate a bit lower. I'll counter-offer again, seeing if I can get her to move further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's original offer and closer to my ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $5,250, which is a good deal for me, and is close to my target price. It's likely she won't go much lower, and it's better to secure a good price than risk losing the deal by continuing to haggle."
