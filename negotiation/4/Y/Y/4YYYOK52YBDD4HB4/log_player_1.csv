"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm aiming to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum of $100, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable, considering Bob's previous offer and my need to earn more than $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating, hoping to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to my minimum acceptable value. This is a firm offer, as I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll move on to selling to John."
