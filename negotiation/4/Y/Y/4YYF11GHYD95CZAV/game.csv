"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I'm definitely interested,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle and offer $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
