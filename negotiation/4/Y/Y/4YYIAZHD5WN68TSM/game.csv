"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,050,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price considering the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,075,000,  which is a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's close this gap. How about $1,090,000? This recognizes the product's value while hopefully addressing your budget concerns.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm happy to go up to $1,080,000, which seems like a fair meeting point. Let's finalise this deal and move forward.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
