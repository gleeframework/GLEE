"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
