"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the potential value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $900000 is below my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a final decision.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
