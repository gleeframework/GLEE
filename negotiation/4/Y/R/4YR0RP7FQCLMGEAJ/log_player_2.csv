"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($900,000 vs. $1,200,000).  There's likely room for negotiation.  It's too early to buy from John, as we might be able to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from Alice's initial offer, but it's still below the product's worth to her. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this will lead to a productive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer to $1,050,000, which is closer to my desired price point. While I could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that she'll come down any further.  There is a risk of running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer allows me to save $150,000 compared to John's price."
