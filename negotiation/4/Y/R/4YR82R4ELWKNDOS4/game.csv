"Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will pay dividends for your business. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1500000, but I'm willing to pay a premium for something unique and valuable. Can you meet me in the middle at $1400000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is a bit too low for me to consider, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1350000? This price still reflects the value and uniqueness of this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, which would be $1275000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its uniqueness and value. Can you consider this offer?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
