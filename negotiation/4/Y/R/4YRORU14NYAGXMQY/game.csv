"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm happy to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,150,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
