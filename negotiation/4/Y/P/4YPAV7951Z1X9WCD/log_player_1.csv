Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product is only worth $12,000 to me, so I'd be willing to offer you $8,000.  I understand this is significantly lower than your asking price, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
