"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair deal and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product is only worth $12,000 to me, so I'd be willing to offer you $8,000.  I understand this is significantly lower than your asking price, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000 either. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value it holds for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, so how about we try splitting the difference again?  I'd be willing to go up to $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value it holds for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
