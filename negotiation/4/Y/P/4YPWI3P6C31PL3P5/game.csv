"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Let me know if it's acceptable to you.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $12500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
