"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm very interested in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000, which is still a great deal considering the value this product brings. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're looking for.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to see some movement from your end. I can offer it to you for $1,180,000, which is a compromise on my end. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
