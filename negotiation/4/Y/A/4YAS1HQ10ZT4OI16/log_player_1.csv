Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** This is the minimum you'll accept â€“ $1,500,000 (because John offers you this amount).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap in your valuations. For a deal to happen, you need to offer a price below Bob's value, but that doesn't mean you need to go below your reservation price.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer at your reservation price. This allows you to be firm with Bob.

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other interested parties. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This offer stands for 48 hours."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight exclusivity and create a sense of urgency.
* **High but Negotiable Price:** $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Time Limit:** The 48-hour limit encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents him from shopping around too much.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You achieve a fantastic deal, exceeding your reservation price.
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might try to negotiate down.  You can stand firm close to your offer, knowing you have John as a backup. 
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed to sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000. 

**Important Notes**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you might soften your approach slightly.
* **Bob's Situation:**  If you have additional information about Bob's needs or constraints, you can adjust your strategy accordingly."
