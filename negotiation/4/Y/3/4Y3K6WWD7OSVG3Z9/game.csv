"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $95? That's a fair offer, considering it's worth more to you than it is to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at $120. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings.",120.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I could meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you be willing to do $107?",107.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at $130. It's getting close to my minimum price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings.",130.0,Alice,7,
