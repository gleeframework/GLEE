"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000 for the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. Considering your offer of $1,100,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, but also takes into account your budget constraints. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
