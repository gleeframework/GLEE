"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your business. I've carefully considered its worth and potential benefits for you, and I'm confident it could bring significant returns. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a price I believe is fair and reflects its value.  This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have another interested party willing to purchase it for $800000. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a strong investment, and I'm eager to discuss it further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,000,000.**
* **You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000.**
* **John is willing to sell for $1,200,000.**

Since you can get the product from John for your maximum price, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with John or at least get the product for your maximum acceptable price."
