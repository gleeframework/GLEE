"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your business. I've carefully considered its worth and potential benefits for you, and I'm confident it could bring significant returns. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a price I believe is fair and reflects its value.  This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have another interested party willing to purchase it for $800000. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a strong investment, and I'm eager to discuss it further with you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
