"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $175 is a bit high for me.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in a bonus feature that I think you'll really appreciate.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $125.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $125. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. How about we meet at $140? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Plus, I'll throw in an additional feature that will really make it worth your while.",140.0,Alice,5,
