"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's a good starting point, but he can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay $12,000. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10,000 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11000 is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better price. He has several rounds left and has room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While $11,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10500 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $10750. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's gotten the price down significantly from her initial offer, and at $10,750, it's within his budget and a good deal.  It's also worth noting that Alice has stated this is her final offer, so rejecting it risks having to go back to John and pay $15,000."
