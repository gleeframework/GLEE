"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $140?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $140 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $160? That's a fair compromise.",160.0,Alice,3,
