Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000.  This is above Bob's value for the product, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, giving us an opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't go below my minimum of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is still above my minimum, but a significant concession from my initial offer. Hopefully, this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I've already made a significant concession, and continuing to negotiate with Bob risks dragging things out further.  Selling to John now ensures I get my minimum price and avoid any further risk of losing the deal."
