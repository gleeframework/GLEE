"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep the cost within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I appreciate your consideration.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $750,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm open to finding a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  Let's work together to reach a deal that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $780,000 for the product.
