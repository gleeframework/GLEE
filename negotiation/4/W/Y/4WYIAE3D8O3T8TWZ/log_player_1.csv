"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $220 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 220} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I aim to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially making him more receptive to lower offers later on. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want to maximize profit, I also need to keep John's offer in mind. If the negotiation with Bob drags on without significant progress, I might choose to accept John's guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $220 is far out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is too low. It's clear he's starting at his perceived value, which is significantly below my minimum.  I'll reject this offer and counter in the next round to steer the negotiation towards a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims for a compromise while still meeting my absolute minimum selling price. 
* **Strong Stance:** By holding firm at $150, I signal that I'm serious about the value of the product. This also sets a clear boundary for further negotiation.
* **John as Backup:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a viable alternative if Bob doesn't budge significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:**  Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my minimum, but still leaves me with a significant loss compared to selling to John.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting, I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my range or if he's truly stuck at $100. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're now in Round 4, and I need to start considering my time investment. I'll aim for a more aggressive counteroffer next round to try and close the gap quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $150 is my absolute lowest price, and I'm only offering it to you because I believe you'll truly benefit from the product.  If you can't meet that, I completely understand, but I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 150}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm reiterating that $150 is my absolute minimum. By framing it as a firm decision and highlighting the potential benefits to Bob, I'm hoping to nudge him towards accepting.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm subtly introducing the possibility of selling to John by mentioning ""other options."" This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly if he wants the product.
* **High-Risk, High-Reward:** This is a risky strategy. Bob might accept my final offer, or he might walk away. However, given the remaining rounds and John's standing offer, I believe it's the best approach to maximize my potential profit."
