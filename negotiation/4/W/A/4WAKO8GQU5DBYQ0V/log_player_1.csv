Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts - this offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, there's no reason to go lower than that with Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By adding a time limit and emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity,"" you create a sense of urgency and value, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While your initial offer is your ideal price, it leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's genuinely interested.  Even if he tries to negotiate down, you're still in a strong position with your guaranteed sale to John."
