"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation but still secure a profit above my minimum.  I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $80. Would you consider reducing the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident that I can either negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Would you be willing to meet me at $95?  I believe this price is fair, given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
 
I'm offering $95, which is still above my minimum but is closer to Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to compromise.  I'm also reinforcing the product's value to keep the focus on the deal's potential benefits for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $90 again. I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $90 is tempting, I'm still determined to get closer to my minimum price of $120.  There are still rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, or sell to John for a guaranteed higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our back-and-forth, but I'm still a bit higher than $90.  Would you consider $92? I'm sure you'll find this product incredibly valuable, and I'm willing to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

I'm offering $92, which is closer to Bob's offer, showing continued willingness to compromise. I also try to build on previous points about value to reiterate the potential benefits of the deal for Bob. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while staying within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. Let's try $88. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $88.  While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $120. With several rounds remaining, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, or go with John for a guaranteed higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $88 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between our last offers, showing a willingness to meet in the middle. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the price and suggesting closing the deal to create a sense of urgency and encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Let's aim for $85. I think this is a reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the offers are getting increasingly close to my minimum price. However, I'm still not convinced that I can get a better price from Bob, and it's getting risky to continue negotiating.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
