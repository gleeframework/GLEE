"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $80. Would you consider reducing the price to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Would you be willing to meet me at $95?  I believe this price is fair, given the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $90 again. I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value our back-and-forth, but I'm still a bit higher than $90.  Would you consider $92? I'm sure you'll find this product incredibly valuable, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",92.0,Alice,5,

"I see your point, Alice. Let's try $88. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $88 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price, and we can close the deal.",90.0,Alice,7,
