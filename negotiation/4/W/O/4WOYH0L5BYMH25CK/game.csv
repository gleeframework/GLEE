"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I can't go as low as $800,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $975,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
