Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price in the next round."
