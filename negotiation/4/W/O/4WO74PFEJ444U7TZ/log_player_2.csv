"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a unique asset that holds significant value. I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. My asking price is $1,150,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product, while also providing you with a considerable margin for potential gains. Please let me know your decision, as I have another interested party who is willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. By rejecting her offer, you can proceed to buy from John for $1,200,000, which is your maximum acceptable price. While Alice mentions another interested party, it's irrelevant in this scenario as you have a viable alternative with John."
