Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still provides substantial value to Bob (a $150,000 gain) while leaving room for me to potentially negotiate upwards. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** The wording emphasizes the limited-time nature of this offer and positions the product as desirable, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome:
* **Ideal Scenario:** Bob accepts the $1,150,000 offer, resulting in a profit above my guaranteed sale.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can proceed with the guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000."
