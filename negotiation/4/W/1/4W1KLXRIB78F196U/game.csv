"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to pay closer to $1,250,000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this now.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,275,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I believe this is a great deal for both of us, and I hope we can close this now.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
