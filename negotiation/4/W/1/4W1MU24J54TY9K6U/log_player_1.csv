Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth every penny.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why this offer:**  Since John is willing to pay the minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, there is no need to go lower. By offering the product to Bob at $1,200,000, Alice maximizes her potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants a lower price.
* **The Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It avoids being pushy and allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob."
