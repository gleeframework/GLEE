"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $14000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16500?  This leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.",16500.0,Alice,3,
