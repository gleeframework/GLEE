"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but not too high to scare him off. There's room for negotiation, and I'm hoping he'll counter with a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum valuation of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $14,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,500?  This leaves room for both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $16500 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $14000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on his price, which is below my minimum. I've tried negotiating, but it seems we're at an impasse.  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get my minimum valuation, and it avoids further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation."
