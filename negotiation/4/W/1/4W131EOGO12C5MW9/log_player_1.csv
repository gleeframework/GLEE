Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you, so I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $13,000 is still a bit low, considering the product's value to him.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $13,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  That gives you a good deal and lets me get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 13750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,200 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a bit more.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Let's compromise at $13,500.  This gives you a great deal on a high-value product, and it works for me as well."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob's offer is just a little lower than my previous counteroffer.  While I would like to get a bit more, the risk of continuing to negotiate and getting a worse offer or having to sell to John for a lower price outweighs the potential gain.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
