"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay closer to my desired value.  Let's close this deal!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,250. How about $8,625? That's the most I can afford, but I'm really interested in the product.",8625.0,Bob,4,
