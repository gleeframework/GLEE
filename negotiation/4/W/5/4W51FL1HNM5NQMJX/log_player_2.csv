Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. How about we split the difference again and settle at $110?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, her ""final offer"" is still more expensive than John's guaranteed price. It's not worth risking a higher price at this point."
