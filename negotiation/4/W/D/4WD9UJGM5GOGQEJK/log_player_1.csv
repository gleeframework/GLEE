Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed $800,000 from John, leaving room for negotiation. It's also a price that may seem attractive to Bob if he values the product higher. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a much higher profit. If he rejects, I can still sell to John and secure a healthy profit."
