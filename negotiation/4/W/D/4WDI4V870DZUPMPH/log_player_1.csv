"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation and still represents a profit for me.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $8,000 as possible, but I'll keep an eye on John's offer in case negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  I have 8 rounds left and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still above my minimum value of $8,000.  However, I have 6 rounds left and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,600.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows that I'm still willing to negotiate while also making progress towards my goal. I'm hoping this will be enough to persuade Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I have 4 rounds left and I'm determined to get a better price. I believe I can get more than $9,350.  It's still a bit risky, but I'll counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to close the deal. I'm getting a bit nervous since time is running out, but I'm still confident I can get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to my minimum, I have two rounds left and I want to see if I can get just a little bit more. I'm still holding out hope that we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

This is my final push. I'm going to counter with $9,400, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and hopefully, a compromise he'll accept.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is my last round, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get more than $8,000, I'm going to go with John's offer. It's better than risking getting nothing at all from Bob, especially since it's at my minimum value."
