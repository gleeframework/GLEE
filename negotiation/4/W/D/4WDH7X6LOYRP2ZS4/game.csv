"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to offer $1,325,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,325,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher, to $1,320,000. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
