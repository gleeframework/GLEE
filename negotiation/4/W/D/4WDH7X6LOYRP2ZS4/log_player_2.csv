"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a counter-offer process and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to pay that much. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $1,200,000 limit. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still not low enough. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to offer $1,325,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,325,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher, to $1,320,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is only $20,000 more than Bob's limit.  It's a good deal for Bob, and he's likely to regret it if he rejects and then has to buy from John for the same price.  He's already gone through a few rounds and hasn't gotten much lower than this. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
