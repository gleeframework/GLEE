"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is subjective, but based on my research and needs, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $14000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the research I've done."
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is my final counteroffer for now. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,3,,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to counteroffer at $12500. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $14000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,5,,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I'm not willing to go up to $13500, Bob. I've already made concessions and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'll make one final offer: $15000, and that's my absolute last offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options."
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go any higher than $15000, Bob. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",15000.0,Alice,7,,
