Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for cheaper from John.  There's no need to negotiate further with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Bob should buy the product from John. At this point, Alice is offering $9,000, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  John offers the best price and will allow Bob to achieve his goal of saving money."
