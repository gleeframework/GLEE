"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you, potentially even more than you realize. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This represents a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value for you and above my minimum asking price. Consider it a win-win!  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.
