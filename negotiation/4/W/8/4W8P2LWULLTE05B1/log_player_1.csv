Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, it's still a very low price considering my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $125. This is still above my minimum but shows my willingness to compromise. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $115 is close enough to my minimum value, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. It's better to accept this offer than to risk selling to John for a lower price or continuing a potentially fruitless negotiation."
