"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth $120 to you at most, and she's asking for $180. It makes sense to reject and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $120. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $160, which is a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is better than $180, it's still higher than my maximum of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a lower price, or just buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. My budget is firm at $120. If you're unable to go lower, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession. I can do $145, which is as low as I'm comfortable going. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $145 is still above my budget.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your flexibility. $145 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $130, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I can do $140, which is my final concession. If you're willing to meet me there, we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still $10 above my maximum budget. While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, it seems like she's firm on $140. At this point, it's better to just buy from John for $120.  I'll save myself the hassle of further negotiation and still get the product within my budget."
