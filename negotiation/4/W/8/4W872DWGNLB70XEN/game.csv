"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This price aligns with my budget and offers a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
