,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, the product's value is truly significant.  How about we meet halfway at $10,000? This would be a fair deal considering its worth.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $9,000? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,4,
