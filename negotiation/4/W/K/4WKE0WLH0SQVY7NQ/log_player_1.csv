Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $174. I believe it's a great deal and would be valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 174}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, I start with a price significantly higher than even my own valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of a premium product.
* **Not Too High:** Setting the price too high (e.g., $300) would likely make Bob immediately dismiss the offer.  $174 is high, but not completely unreasonable. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives me leverage. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always propose a lower price, knowing I have a safety net."
