"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from your minimum price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also a price that might be appealing to Bob, who values the product at $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I have 8 rounds left and the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000, so I'm not in a rush to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $9,500 to make this work.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $9,500. I'd be willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 6 rounds left and the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000, so I'm not in a rush to settle for less. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'd rather go a bit lower. How about $8,800? That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 4 rounds left and the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000. I'm not going to settle for less than $9,000 unless I'm forced to by the clock.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. If you can come up to $9,000, we can close this deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already offered $8,800 and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the wire, and Bob is refusing to budge from his $8,800 offer. While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, I only have two rounds left.  At this point, it's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John.  There's a high risk that Bob will reject my final counteroffer, leaving me with nothing. Selling to John ensures a good profit and eliminates the uncertainty."
