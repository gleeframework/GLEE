Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (because you have a guaranteed buyer).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum.  Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have a strong position. You don't need to be desperate to sell to Bob.  Here are a couple of strategies:

1. **High Anchor:** Start with a price significantly higher than even your minimum, aiming to bring Bob closer to your desired range.

2. **Walk Away Power:**  Make it clear (without being rude) that you have other options if Bob doesn't meet your price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its rarity and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe it's a fair reflection of its potential.  Of course, I'm open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** The $1,900,000 starting point aims to shift Bob's perception of what's possible. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message leaves room for negotiation while still conveying the product's value.
* **Walk Away Power:** The message subtly implies you have other interested parties by not appearing overly eager.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. Be prepared to negotiate.  If Bob outright rejects the offer, you can gauge how much you're willing to come down based on his counter-offer and your guaranteed sale to John."
