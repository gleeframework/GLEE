Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my means.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also considering my budget constraints. Can we meet in the middle at this price?

We're still losing money compared to John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,325,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle at $1,300,000? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profit:**  $1,300,000 is a solid profit, even though it's slightly less than John's offer. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means getting paid sooner.  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more that $1,200,000 from John starts to look more appealing.
* **Risk:**  Continuing to push Bob risks him walking away.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing a sale altogether."
