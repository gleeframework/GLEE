"Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. This product represents a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you.  I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. Given its potential value, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my means.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,400,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also considering my budget constraints. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 remains below its true market value. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,325,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,325,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle at $1,300,000? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
