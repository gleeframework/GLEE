"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, given its value to you is estimated at $10,000. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to counter with an offer of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is still lower than John's offer of $10,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase at a price that's within Bob's budget and saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John."
