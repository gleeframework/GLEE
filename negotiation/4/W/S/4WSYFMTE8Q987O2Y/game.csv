As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, that price is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Could you consider something closer to $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $5,000. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would be a great deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to be more flexible. Considering our previous offers, I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8,200. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,

"You're getting closer, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you at $7,500.  That's a fair offer considering John is offering a similar product.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $7,500. Considering the product's value and our previous offers, I'm thinking of selling it to you for $7,800. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,7,
