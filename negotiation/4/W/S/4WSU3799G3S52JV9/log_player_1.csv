"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also leaving room for negotiation in case Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my desired price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer and move on."
