"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price that's fair to both of us. I understand its value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's start with a price of $850,000.  This gives you a solid deal, and it allows me to get a bit more for my product.  Consider it, and let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,
