Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $120. It's a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  The high price will help gauge Bob's interest. If he's immediately put off, you know he's very price-sensitive. If he counters, you can start negotiating.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You always have John as a backup who is willing to pay your minimum price, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly below both your valuation and your initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $65 is quite low.  Could you do $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  We're coming down from our initial offer to show willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Bob's Value:** The new price of $110 is still above Bob's perceived value ($80).  There's room for him to counter-offer while keeping the deal potentially profitable for us. 
* **John as Leverage:**  We're still above our guaranteed sale price to John ($100), so we have some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob is willing to pay $85, which is above his perceived value of the product ($80). This suggests he might be more motivated to buy than initially thought.
* **Profitable:** While not ideal, $85 is still a profit over your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit and avoids a drawn-out process."
