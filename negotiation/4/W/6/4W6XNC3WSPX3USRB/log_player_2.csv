"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000."", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room to negotiate upwards while staying within my budget.
* **Significant Difference:** Alice's offer is extremely high compared to my budget. A low counteroffer signals I'm serious but need her to come down significantly.
* **Psychology:** By mentioning a specific number ($6,000), I might anchor the negotiation around that figure, making it a psychological reference point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000 either. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18,000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice lowered her price, $18,000 is still significantly higher than my $8,000 budget and the guaranteed $8,000 alternative with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move down suggests there's flexibility in the price. Rejecting this offer encourages her to negotiate further.
* **Backup Plan:** I have the security of buying from John if negotiations with Alice don't reach an acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $8,000.  If you can work with that, I'm ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** It's time to be more transparent about my budget.  This helps Alice understand the seriousness of my constraints.
* **Final Offer (Almost):** By presenting $8,000, I'm signaling that this is my top price, leaving little room for further concessions on my end.
* **Pressure Point:**  Alice now knows that I have an alternative ($8,000 from John). This might push her to accept my offer or propose something closer to my range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. That's below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **At My Limit:** Alice's compromise at $12,000 is still significantly above my $8,000 budget.
* **Finality:** Her statement about reaching her lowest price indicates further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.
* **Secure Alternative:**  I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring I stay within my budget. 

It's better to secure the product at a price I can afford than to risk exceeding my budget by continuing negotiations with Alice."
