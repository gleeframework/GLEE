"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Let's try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still gives room for negotiation and keeps us well below our $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good. Let's see if we can bring the price down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, $70 is quite a drop. How about $80? That seems like a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to settle at a price that's advantageous for us while still potentially acceptable to Alice, as it's her estimated value."
