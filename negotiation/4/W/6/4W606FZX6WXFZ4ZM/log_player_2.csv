Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $109 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $111.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth, and it gives us both a good deal.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $111. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable discount while avoiding the risk of the deal falling through."
