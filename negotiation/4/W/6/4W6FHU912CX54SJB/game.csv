"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes the value of this product.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, I think $800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $500,000. This recognizes its potential while reflecting a fair price for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $500,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll derive from it. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway, but $900,000 is still a significant investment. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $650,000? I believe that represents a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $650,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll derive from it. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, the gap between our positions is still quite large.  To be completely transparent,  I'm seriously considering accepting an offer from another seller at $750,000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $750,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll derive from it. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but I'm afraid we're at an impasse.  I'm authorized to offer a maximum of $775,000.  If that works for you, I'm ready to finalize the purchase right now. Otherwise, I'll need to pursue the alternative option.",775000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $775,000.
