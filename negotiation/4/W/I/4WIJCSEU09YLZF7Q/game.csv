"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price.  While I'm very interested, $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for this product, which is what I'd need to go ahead with the purchase. Would you be open to that?",100.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, so I'm thinking of $105. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",105.0,Alice,5,
