"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your business.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision as soon as possible.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's eager to purchase it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is less than Alice's offer of $1,250,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
