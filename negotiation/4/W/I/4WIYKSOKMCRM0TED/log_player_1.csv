"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value of $15,000, I'm not willing to sell to John just yet. I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is my final offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,500 is above my minimum value of $15,000, and it's likely the best I can get from him. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of him rejecting my offer or walking away altogether is high. Accepting this offer ensures I get a profit and avoid losing out on a sale."
