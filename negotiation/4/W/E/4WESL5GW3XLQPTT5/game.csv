"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go as low as $750000.  How about we meet in the middle at $825000? This price still allows you a good deal and gives me a reasonable return on my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $775000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",775000.0,Bob,4,
