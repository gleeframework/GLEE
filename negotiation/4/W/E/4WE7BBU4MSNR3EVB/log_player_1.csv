{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate, but it still allows for a good profit for me.  It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to make a profit.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,500 is unfortunately not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $8,500? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm trying to keep it closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough price for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below a certain point. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  let's split the difference and go with $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
