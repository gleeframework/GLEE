You have three options:

Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is slowly coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the product from John at $100 and avoid potentially missing out entirely."
