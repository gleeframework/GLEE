"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident you'd find it extremely valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $12,500.  This is a great price for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and still a profitable deal for me. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
