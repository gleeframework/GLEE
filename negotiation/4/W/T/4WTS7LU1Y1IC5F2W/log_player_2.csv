Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still think I can get a bit more. How about we meet at $140? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $140.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. It's better to buy from John for $150 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
