"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,200,000 falls short of what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is my final offer this round.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here, but I need you to understand the true value of what I'm offering.  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, but I can't go any lower than that.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,300,000, so I'm offering $1,275,000. Can you consider this offer?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
