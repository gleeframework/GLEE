"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to negotiate, but I can't go lower than $160.  It's a great product and worth the investment. How about we split the difference this time?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you at $145. Would you be willing to consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $145 is still below my $150 minimum.  I'll counteroffer one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I hear you! $145 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's try $155.  It's just a bit more, and I think you'll really be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still a bit away from your target, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'd be willing to meet you at $152. That's the best I can do. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $152 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to take a small loss to secure the deal and avoid selling to John at the lower price."
