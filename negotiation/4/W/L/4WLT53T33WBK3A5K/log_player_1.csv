"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a strong starting point, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also signals to Bob that I value the product highly.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round. While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a higher price.  Bob's initial rejection of my $20,000 offer indicates he may be willing to pay more than $15,000, but I need to test that hypothesis."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle, suggesting he may be willing to pay a little more than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $16,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer is only $1,000 below my last offer.  I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate, especially with John's offer of $15,000 still available. This seems like a good compromise,  getting me a price higher than John's and closer to my desired price."
