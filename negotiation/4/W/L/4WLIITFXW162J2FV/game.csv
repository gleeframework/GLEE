"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm sure you'll find it a great value.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
