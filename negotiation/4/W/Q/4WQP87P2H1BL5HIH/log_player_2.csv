You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $9250?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9250. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $9750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has already made a good amount of progress, getting the price down from $10,000 to $9,750.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise and the price might go back up. Accepting the offer at $9,750 is a good deal, saving Bob $2,250 compared to buying from John."
