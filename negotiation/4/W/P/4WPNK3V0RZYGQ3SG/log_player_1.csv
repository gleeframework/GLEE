Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at the special price of $119. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** You want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $100.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures you get a price very close to your minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
