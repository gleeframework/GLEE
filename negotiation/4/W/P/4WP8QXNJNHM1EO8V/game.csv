"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. The product is a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it still allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product brings to me and your desired profit.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer $1,012,500. This price reflects the value the product brings to you while ensuring I can make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",990000.0,Bob,6,
