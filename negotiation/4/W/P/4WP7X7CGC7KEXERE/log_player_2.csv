"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  You can likely get a better price than $1,000,001."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still within the range of what the product is worth to you.  It's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, but it's still higher than what you're comfortable with. You can continue to negotiate and see if you can get it lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to your target, it's still not the best deal. There's a chance you can get a better price through further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's last offer.  It shows you're willing to meet her halfway but also still trying to save as much as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to your ideal price. Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time or Alice deciding to sell to someone else. It's a good deal, and it's better than buying from John for $1,500,000."
