Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price from John creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, and I can potentially still meet my goal. 
* **Highlight Value:**  By emphasizing the product's ""value and potential,"" I'm reminding Bob why it's worth a significant investment, even if it's slightly above his initial valuation."
