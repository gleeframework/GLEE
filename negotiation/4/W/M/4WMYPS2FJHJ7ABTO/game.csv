"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12000. I can offer it to you for $13500. I think it's a great compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
