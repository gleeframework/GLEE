"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $10,150? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. ",10150.0,Alice,5,
