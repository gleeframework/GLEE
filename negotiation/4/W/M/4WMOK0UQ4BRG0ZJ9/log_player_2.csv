"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$130 is considerably more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try a counteroffer to see if Alice will come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. While I like it, $130 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it leaves room for me to increase my offer and still stay well below my $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $95 is still above my budget. I'll counter with a price closer to my limit, leaving a tiny bit of wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $75? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counteroffer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **Close to my Limit:**  $75 is just below my $80 maximum, leaving minimal room for further negotiation if Alice pushes back.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""ready to buy it right now,"" I'm signaling to Alice that this is a serious offer, potentially prompting her to accept rather than risk losing the sale.
* **""Fair Price"" Framing:** Presenting $75 as a ""fair price"" positions it as a reasonable compromise, hopefully making it more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more. Let's meet in the middle at $85.  I really want to sell this to you, but I can't go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower, and $85 is above my strict $80 limit. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for a guaranteed good deal."
