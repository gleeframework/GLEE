"I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a more reasonable price considering its value and potential. I'm willing to pay that amount for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While I value your offer, $800000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold for this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950000.  This price still reflects the product's unique value and potential. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to discussing further.",950000.0,Alice,3,
