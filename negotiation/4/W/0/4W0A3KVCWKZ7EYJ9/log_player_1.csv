Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,125,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is a fair offer considering the unique value proposition this presents."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we split the difference from our previous offers, say $1,537,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,537,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,537,500

Even though Bob's offer is now above John's standing offer, I'm still aiming higher. I believe I have leverage to push for a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  However, I can't accept anything less than $1,725,000 for this product.  It's a remarkably fair price considering the long-term value and potential this represents."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,725,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,631,250?  This is a fair offer and I'm hoping we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,631,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,631,250

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,631,250 is a strong outcome. It significantly exceeds John's offer, and time is a factor in a negotiation."
