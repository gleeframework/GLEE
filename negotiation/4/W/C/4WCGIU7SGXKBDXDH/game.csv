"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $10,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to accept $11,000 for the product.  This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to recoup a significant portion of its value.  Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,3,
