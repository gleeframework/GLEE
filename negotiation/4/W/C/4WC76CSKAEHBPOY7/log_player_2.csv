"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $170 is way above your budget of $80.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $85 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $125?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from $170, $125 is still above my maximum budget of $80. It's worth rejecting and counter-offering again, aiming to find a middle ground closer to my budget."
