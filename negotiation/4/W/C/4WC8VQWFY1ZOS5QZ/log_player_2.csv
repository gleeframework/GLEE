"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $150 to you, but Alice is only offering it for $120. There's room for negotiation. You can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a good start, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for you.  You're still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer is the best option."
