Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob is ideal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal with Bob quickly might be preferable even if it means a slightly lower profit than waiting for John. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes no negative consequences if Bob rejects the offer and we go to John.
* Bob's negotiation skills and willingness to pay more than his perceived value are unknown factors."
