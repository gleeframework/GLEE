Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  $2 million is a significant amount, but I believe it's within the realm of possibility if Bob truly values the product.  I'll be prepared to counter if he rejects my offer, keeping in mind my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,900,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still allows me to profit more than selling to John. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is only $100,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of him walking away completely, or me having to accept John's lower offer.  It's time to close the deal."
