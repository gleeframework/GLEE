"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable item. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,500,000, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You might be able to get a lower price from Alice if you reject her offer, but there's no guarantee.  It's safer to go with the known price from John."
