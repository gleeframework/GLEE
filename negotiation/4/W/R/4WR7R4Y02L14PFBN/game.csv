Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $12000. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the details.  While I see the value in this unique product,  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you consider a price of $9000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make this product work for me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
