"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $175. This is far more than you are willing to pay. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working with a budget.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This would still allow me to cover my costs.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

While $140 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
