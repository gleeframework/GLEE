Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to be confident and friendly in the message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $120? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working with a budget.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This would still allow me to cover my costs.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I'm still a bit over my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired range. I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer who will pay my full asking price. It's better to secure a sale with John at $150 than risk further negotiations with Bob, which may not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
