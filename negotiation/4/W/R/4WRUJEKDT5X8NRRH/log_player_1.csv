"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $130. It's still above my minimum, and hopefully, it's more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $115 is still a bit lower than what I'd like, it's getting closer to my minimum and the negotiation is taking time. It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale rather than risk losing more time and potentially ending up with John's $120 offer."
