"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. Can you consider selling it to me for $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $16000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $15500. This is the best price I can offer. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but $15500 is still not within my budget. I'm starting to think that I might have to consider buying from John. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance. Can you meet me at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $14500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $14500 is still not acceptable to me. I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay up to $13500, and I'm starting to get serious about buying from John. Can you meet me at $13500, or I'll have to walk away from the deal?",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting serious about buying from John, and I don't want to lose the deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to understand that this is my final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.
