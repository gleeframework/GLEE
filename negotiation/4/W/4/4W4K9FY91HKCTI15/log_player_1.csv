Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would find very valuable. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **My Minimum:** I need at least $10,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a backup buyer (John) at $10,000.
* **Negotiation:**  Offering $13,000 gives Bob a good deal while still netting me a significant profit over my minimum.

**This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider.**"
