"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum price. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but not so high that it scares Bob away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $14,000 is still below my minimum price, but it's closer than his initial rejection. I'll proceed to the next round and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,300.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $14,300. While it's still slightly below my desired price, I'm running out of time.  With only 4 rounds left, I risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale at a price that's within my minimum acceptable range."
