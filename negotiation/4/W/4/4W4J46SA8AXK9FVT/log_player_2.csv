"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly lower than her stated value for the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $450,000?"",
""product_price"": 450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counter-offer to test Alice's boundaries. This leaves me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $550,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is negotiating, which is good, but the price is still higher than I'd like. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I want to see if I can get her closer to my target price. There are still several rounds left in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I think the product is great,  $550,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be open to $480,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 480000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to move, but I'm still aiming to stay well below $500,000. I want to see if she's willing to drop below the $500,000 mark."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $480,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm offering the product to you for $520,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $520,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting firmer on her price, but her latest offer is still above my target. While $520,000 is a decent price, I'm willing to push a bit further.  I'll reject and propose a counter-offer a bit closer to her price to see if she'll budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, the product does have a lot of value. How about we settle this right now at $500,000? That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you accept."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm holding firm at $500,000. This is a strong offer, especially since Alice indicated $520,000 is her lowest. By proposing a clean number and indicating a sense of urgency to close, I'm hoping to persuade her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to make a strong offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm offering the product to you for $510,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $510,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $510,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has presented this as her final offer, and while it's slightly above my target, it's a good price considering the potential value of the product and the effort already invested in the negotiation. Continuing to push could risk the deal, and $510,000 is a reasonable compromise."
