Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is more than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still offers a significant value for you, and keeps the deal profitable for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a satisfactory outcome.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to sell for $1,300,000,  $1,250,000 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000. There's a chance Bob will reject any further counteroffers, so it's best to secure this deal while I can."
