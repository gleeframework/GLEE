"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This still offers a significant value for you, and keeps the deal profitable for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a satisfactory outcome.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
