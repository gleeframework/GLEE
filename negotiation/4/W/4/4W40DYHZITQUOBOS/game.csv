"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $200 is a bit too high for my budget though. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is too low for me.  Could you do $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand $60 is too low. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $100?,100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we are finding some middle ground. How about $160? That's a pretty significant reduction from my initial ask.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, anything over $110 is just not going to work for me. If you're willing to come down just a bit more, I think we have a deal!",110.0,Bob,6,
