"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is $15,000. It's too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum value of $12,000 as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $11,000 is a good starting point for negotiation. It shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer from $15,000 to $13,000, which is getting closer to Bob's value of $12,000. However, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. He's increasing his offer from $11,000 to $11,500, showing Alice he's willing to compromise. This counteroffer is still below Alice's last offer of $13,000, demonstrating a clear intent to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly to $12,500, but Bob is still determined to try and get the product for closer to his target price. The risk of going to John for $12,000 is still present, but Bob is motivated to see if he can get a better deal with Alice. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his maximum value for the product. This counteroffer presents a final attempt to see if Alice will accept the price he's willing to pay. If Alice rejects, Bob can confidently go to John and buy the product for the same price."
