,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $112, which is a fair compromise.  This would be a great price for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
