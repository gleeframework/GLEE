"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product of significant value. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you. To be fair, I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its potential value to me and your desired selling point.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is considerably below its true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my desired range. I'm aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting this offer gives me another round to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer.  I have other interested parties, but I believe this deal would be mutually beneficial.
