Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to give you a slightly better offer. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $125, and John offers the product for $120.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal."
