"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your need to make a sale.  Let's find a way to make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. I'm getting closer to your offer, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $10,200 is still too far from my budget.  I'm firm on $9,750, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value to me and your need to sell.  I'm confident we can close this deal with a little more give and take.",9750.0,Bob,6,
