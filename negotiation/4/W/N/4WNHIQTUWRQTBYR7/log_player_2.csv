"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $90. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $90. Although this is a good deal compared to John's price, you can still get it for a lower price by rejecting her offer.  You'll then have the option to buy it from John for $100, but you're hoping Alice will counteroffer with a lower price to avoid buying from John."
