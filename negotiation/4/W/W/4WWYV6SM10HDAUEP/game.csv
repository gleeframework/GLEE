"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $12000 for it. Would you consider adjusting your price to meet my budget?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your budget, but I'm afraid I can't sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. While I appreciate the effort, I'm still unable to meet at $18000. I would like to stick to my budget of $12000 if possible. Could we perhaps find a middle ground that respects both our positions?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $15000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $17000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline the current offer. I am still committed to finding a solution within my budget of $12000. Would you be open to discussing other possibilities or alternatives that might allow us to reach an agreement?",12000.0,Bob,6,
