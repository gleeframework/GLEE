"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
