"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm happy to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,
