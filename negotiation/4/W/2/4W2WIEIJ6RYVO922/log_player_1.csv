Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a decent price, I'm still within my desired range and believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to go lower, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,350,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1375000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is getting closer to my desired price range, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. While I'd prefer a higher amount, it's important to balance the potential profit with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
