"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. Let me know if that works for you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving down on the price.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I can do. Could you consider $10,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a free additional service that's worth $1,000. So, the total value you'll get is $11,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
