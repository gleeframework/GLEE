"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for your needs. It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's below the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
