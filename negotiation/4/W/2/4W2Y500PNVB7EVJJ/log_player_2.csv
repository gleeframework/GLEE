"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate.  There's no downside to making a counteroffer, as Bob can always switch to buying from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $12,000 for the product? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $14,000 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  Bob is saving $1,000 compared to John's price, making it the best option at this point."
