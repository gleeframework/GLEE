"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested,  $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit higher than my budget. How about $10,750? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,750 is close, but I need to get at least $10,900 for this.  It's a steal at that price. What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
