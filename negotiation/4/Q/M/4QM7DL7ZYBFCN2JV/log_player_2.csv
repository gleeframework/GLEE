"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it's worth exploring if you can get the product from Alice for less than $60."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price quickly.  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's original price, but it is still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This will force Alice to either accept a lower price or counter with a higher price.  We'll see where we go from here!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down in price, which is good.  However, I'm still hoping for a lower price. I will try another counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still keep it below the $50 she offered.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where she can accept, but I can still get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming up in price, which means she's likely getting closer to her minimum acceptable price.  While $55 is not the lowest I'd like to pay, it's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $100. It's a good compromise to accept and move on."
