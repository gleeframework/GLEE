"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal considering its value.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget.  However,  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,250.  This is a fair price considering its value and our previous negotiations. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not sure if I can go up to $10,250. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I think this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations and the price I could get from another seller.",10000.0,Bob,6,
