"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $2,000,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident this price reflects that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Confidence and Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value and my confidence in the price. This sets the tone for a potential negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the door open for negotiation. It's a balanced approach that starts strong but allows for flexibility in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. However, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm rejecting his offer to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. 

**Strategy:**

I'm holding out for a better deal, hoping that Bob will increase his offer or I can find a middle ground. I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can achieve a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,400,000 is a significant amount, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This reflects a compromise, but I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price, demonstrating flexibility and good faith.
* **Fair Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price, highlighting that $1,750,000 is still a fair deal for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation open and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still achieving a price closer to my initial asking price.  It's a calculated move designed to balance my desire for a good price with the need to avoid losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  However, we are already in round 4, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

Selling to John now guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  It's a safe and practical decision, considering the time constraints and potential for a lower offer in the future."
