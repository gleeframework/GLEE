Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Open-ended question:**  This encourages Bob to respond and give me an indication of his interest. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation. If it's too low, I'll be prepared to either make a counter-counteroffer or  sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  He's offering my minimum acceptable price.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** There's no guarantee I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Time is money:**  It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk losing time and potentially ending up with the same price. 

I'm accepting Bob's offer and selling the product to him for $12,000."
