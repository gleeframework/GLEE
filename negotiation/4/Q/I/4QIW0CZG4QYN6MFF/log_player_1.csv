Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,300,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000. John's guaranteed offer ensures I receive the product's full value to me."
