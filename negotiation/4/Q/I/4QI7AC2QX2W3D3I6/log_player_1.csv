Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to establish a rapport with Bob and make him feel more comfortable negotiating.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  I'm not setting a hardline price and am open to hearing his thoughts, expecting a counteroffer."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's in between Bob's offer of $85 and my initial offer of $100.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's offer of $90 and my previous offer of $95. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
