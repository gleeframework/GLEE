"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $85 is a good price, but I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still get a great deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",90.0,Bob,4,
