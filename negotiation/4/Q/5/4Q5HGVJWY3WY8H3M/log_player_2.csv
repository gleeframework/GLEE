**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above the value Bob is willing to pay.  

* **Rejecting** Alice's offer allows Bob to negotiate with John, potentially getting a lower price or finding a better deal elsewhere."
