"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a price of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more to you than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. I think it's a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this offer. I'm willing to walk away and explore other options. However, I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $950000, and if you're willing to accept it, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make one last attempt at a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $1000000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling it to John for $1500000.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
