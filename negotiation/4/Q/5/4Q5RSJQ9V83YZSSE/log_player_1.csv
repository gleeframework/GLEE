Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the value it brings. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still guaranteeing you a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
