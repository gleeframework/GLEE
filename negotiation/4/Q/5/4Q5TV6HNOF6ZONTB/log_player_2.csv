# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,000 for it, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, he can still do better."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This is a great deal for you, and it's closer to my target price.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

Bob should buy the product from John.  While $10,750 is closer to his target price, John is offering the product for $10,000 which is the absolute maximum he's willing to spend."
