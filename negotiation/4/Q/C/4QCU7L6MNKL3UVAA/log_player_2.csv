"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than his target of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to $1,200,000 as possible.  Offering $1,250,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's seriousness in negotiating while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's target price of $1,200,000.  It's also higher than the $1,350,000 she offered in Round 1. This suggests Alice may be willing to negotiate further. Bob can continue to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. His previous offer of $1,250,000 was rejected, so he's increasing his offer slightly to $1,300,000. This shows he's willing to compromise but still wants a price lower than Alice's latest offer of $1,400,000.  He's hoping this will be a more appealing offer for Alice while still being within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to her original asking price. This suggests she's not very willing to negotiate further.  It's also more than Bob's target price of $1,200,000.  The potential for further rounds of negotiation is high, but with only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a better deal increases.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 guarantees a price that meets Bob's goal and avoids further haggling."
