"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $97 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $101? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",101.0,Alice,5,
