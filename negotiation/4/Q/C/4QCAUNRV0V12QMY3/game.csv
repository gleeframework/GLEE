"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? I believe this would be more in line with what I'm currently able to afford.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering our current discussion, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This price is within my budget and still allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",10000.0,Bob,4,
