"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects my interest while acknowledging the value you're offering.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value and your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $10,200. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth while showing I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $10,200 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? That's a firm offer on my end.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price, Bob. I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $10,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",10100.0,Alice,5,
