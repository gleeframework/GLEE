"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its true worth and your needs, I propose a price of $9,500. This offer is valid for the next 3 rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  We have time to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $7,000. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. A low starting counteroffer encourages Alice to move closer to our desired price range. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. We express interest while clearly stating our budget limitations. 
* **Leaving Room for Movement:**  Our counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's, but it leaves space for us to meet in the middle during subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To make it more attractive for you, I am now proposing a price of $8,200. This is still above what you're willing to pay, but I hope this revised offer will help us reach an agreement. This offer is valid for the next 3 rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice moved closer to our desired price, $8,200 is still above our $8,000 limit. 
* **Negotiating Room:** We're getting closer, and Alice seems willing to negotiate. Rejecting this offer signals that we're aiming for a lower price without being too aggressive.
* **Time Constraint:** We have time to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,200 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $7,500? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not making a large jump.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  By suggesting we find a ""middle ground,"" we emphasize the collaborative nature of the negotiation.
* **Time Management:** We're over halfway through the rounds. Our counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price below our limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $8,000. This is the highest I can go while still ensuring a fair profit for us. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer is valid for the next 3 rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Our Limit:** Alice's offer of $8,000 matches our maximum budget. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and we risk losing the opportunity to buy at this price.
* **Matching John's Offer:** Even if we walked away now, John's offer is also $8,000, so we wouldn't save any more money. 

It's a good deal! We've successfully negotiated a price within our budget."
