Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth without revealing your own minimum.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer,"" ""other interested parties"") can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your absolute minimum price.
* There's a risk Bob might be turned off by the high initial price and walk away. However, since you have John as a guaranteed buyer, this risk is somewhat mitigated."
