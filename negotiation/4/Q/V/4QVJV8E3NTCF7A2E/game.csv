"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a good compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
