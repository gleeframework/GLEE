Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing, you imply it might be sold for even more later. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, you've made a significant profit. If he rejects, you can always negotiate down, knowing your safety net is John's offer."
