"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  I know it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000. Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer.  How about $16,500? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer.  While I value the product, I have a strict budget in mind. Would you consider $13,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows how serious I am about buying.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, $13,500 still falls short of what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $14,250? This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. It seems like we are almost there!  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
