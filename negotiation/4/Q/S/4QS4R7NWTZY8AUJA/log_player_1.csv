Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $12,000, as that's below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer.  How about $16,500? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 16500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer.  While I value the product, I have a strict budget in mind. Would you consider $13,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows how serious I am about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, $13,500 still falls short of what I need to make this worthwhile.

Round 6
