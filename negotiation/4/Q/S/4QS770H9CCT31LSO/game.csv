"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that reflects its exceptional value.  I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you.  My offer is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a game-changer in your industry, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. I'm definitely interested in this product, but I have to stick to my budget. Would you consider $925,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still too low. This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for you.  To make this deal work, I need to see a price closer to $1 million. How about $975,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to secure a beneficial outcome.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, this product is exceptional, and I believe it can make a real difference for me. To show you I'm serious, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? That's my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
