Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that reflects its exceptional value.  I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you.  My offer is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we bring it down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $800,000 is a significant sum, it's far below what the product is worth to me. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer this early in the negotiation. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a game-changer in your industry, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. I'm definitely interested in this product, but I have to stick to my budget. Would you consider $925,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is closer to what I want, it's still a significant discount from the value of the product.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's worth pushing for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still too low. This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for you.  To make this deal work, I need to see a price closer to $1 million. How about $975,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to secure a beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, this product is exceptional, and I believe it can make a real difference for me. To show you I'm serious, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, I'm starting to run out of time and this offer is almost at my minimum threshold. It's a significant investment for Bob, and he seems genuinely interested.  Accepting his offer will secure a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely."
