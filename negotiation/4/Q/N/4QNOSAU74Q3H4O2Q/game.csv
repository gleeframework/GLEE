"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 right now.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to let it go for. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
