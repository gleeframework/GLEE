Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to offer it to you at the discounted price of $1,150,000. This offer stands only until [Date - 24 to 48 hours later], as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to aim higher with Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for negotiation and might deter Bob. A price too low undervalues the product.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Adding a time limit and mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**This strategy aims to achieve the following:**

* **Ideal Scenario:** Bob accepts the $1,150,000 offer, giving you a profit above your guaranteed price.
* **Backup:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you still have the security of selling to John at your desired minimum."
