"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $9,500. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to the product's value to her ($8,000).  It's too early to buy from John at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me though.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to start with a low anchor to create room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to come down significantly, there's potential for a good deal. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We still have the option to buy from John for $10,000 if Alice is unwilling to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still above her own perceived value of the product. Let's keep negotiating. We have plenty of rounds left, and there's no rush to take a price that's still significantly above what Alice sees as fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you be open to $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer slightly to show Alice we're willing to move, but not too much.  
* **Staying Below Value:**  We're aiming to stay well below Alice's $8,000 perceived value.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By continuing to negotiate, we keep the pressure on Alice to lower her price to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $8,200. This is my final offer before considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is trying a common negotiation tactic by claiming this is her final offer. It's likely not her true bottom line, and there's still room for negotiation.
* **Still Above Value:**  $8,200 is still above Alice's $8,000 perceived value. We can push a little further.
* **John as Backup:** We have John as a backup option, so we don't need to feel pressured to accept a price we're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can tell this is a quality product.  How about we split the difference and call it $8,000 even?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By offering to ""split the difference,"" we signal a willingness to compromise and make the negotiation feel more collaborative.
* **Target Value:**  This offer is right at Alice's perceived value of the product. While she would ideally like more, it's a strong offer that she might find difficult to refuse.
* **Time Pressure:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. This offer increases the pressure on Alice to make a deal."
