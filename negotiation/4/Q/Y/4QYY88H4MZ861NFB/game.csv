"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $17,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,000 is far too low for this product. To be fair to both of us, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $15,500. This is a significant reduction from my original offer and a price that's still beneficial for me.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a compromise that reflects both our needs and is closer to my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
