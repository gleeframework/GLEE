{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's estimated value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a clear expectation of a potential profit for Bob.  

Remember, I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $1,500,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $1,350,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer. I'm not in a rush, and I have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop my price to $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a $25,000 reduction from my previous offer, which shows I'm willing to negotiate.  It also stays above Bob's offer, indicating I believe the product is worth more. This gives me leverage, while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and I've already compromised twice.  I don't want to risk losing time and potentially going through more rounds of negotiation without making progress.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,500,000."
