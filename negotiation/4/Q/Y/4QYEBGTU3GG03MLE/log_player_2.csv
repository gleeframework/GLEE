"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm aiming for a price around $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a significantly lower price to maximize savings, especially since we have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $12,000 is still above our target price. We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $10,500? That would work well for me."", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

We're nudging the price down in smaller increments now to signal that we're serious about our budget while still showing willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I need to be mindful of the product's value.  Would you consider $11,500? That's a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our range, but we're still above our target. We'll try one more time to get closer to $10,000, knowing we can likely get it for $11,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right - we're definitely getting closer.  I could make it work with $11,000.  Do you think that would be possible?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to be our final push. It lands on a rounded number, signaling we're nearing our limit, and gives Alice a chance to close the deal at a price advantageous for both of us."
