"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a competitive price of $14,000. I believe this product will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above his desired maximum of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is within Bob's budget of $15,000 and a better price than what John is offering.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a further negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price or a dead end."
