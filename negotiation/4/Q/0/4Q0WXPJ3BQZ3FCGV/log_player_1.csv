Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to $9,000. How about $8,900? It's a small step up from your offer, but it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your last offer and am willing to go up to $8,850 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,850.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time, I will accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, it's getting close to my goal, and there are only a few rounds left. It's better to secure a sale at $8,850 than risk losing Bob and being forced to sell to John for $8,000."
