Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit hesitant to commit to the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer below $14,000. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $13,000?  That's a fair offer considering John is willing to sell it for less."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,500. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product, and I'd rather explore other options. I'm willing to make one last offer: $13,500 or I'll have to consider selling to John. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting impatient and unwilling to budge much further.  She's even using the ""selling to John"" tactic as leverage. Since we know John represents our absolute best-case scenario at $10,000, it's no longer strategically advantageous to continue negotiating with Alice."
