"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, Alice, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $1,150,000. My final offer is $1,225,000.  This is a considerable reduction and reflects my willingness to close this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
