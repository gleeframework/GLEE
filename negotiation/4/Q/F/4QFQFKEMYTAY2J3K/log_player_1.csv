Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still giving you a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still far below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
