"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is the highest I can go at this time. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your compromise. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, and I think that's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's aim for a win-win here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer is increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's $10,000 offer within the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer is the safest option to ensure I get a fair price for the product."
