"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is the highest I can go at this time. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your compromise. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, and I think that's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's aim for a win-win here.",9500.0,Bob,4,
