"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value it holds, and I'm willing to make a serious investment in it. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $500000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. However, I'm open to finding a compromise.  I'm willing to lower my price to $850000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement with you.  Let's work together to bridge this gap and finalise this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $725000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds, and I'm willing to make a serious investment in it. What do you think?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $725000 still falls short of my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $762500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe that the product's value justifies this price.  Let's see if we can close this deal with this final offer.",762500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $750000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll make a counteroffer of $750000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,6,
