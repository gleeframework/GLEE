"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $9,500 is above your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a lower price.

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you can try to secure a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $9,000 is still above your maximum budget of $12,000, and we want to try to save as much money as possible. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:** We have 8 rounds remaining, so there's still room to negotiate a lower price.

**Strategy:**  By rejecting the offer, you can try to get Alice to lower the price further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,800. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:**  $8,800 is now within your budget and is much closer to your desired price of $8,500.
* **Risk of going to John:**  If you reject this offer, you risk Alice becoming more firm on her price, or even backing out of the deal completely. Going to John would cost you more ($12,000).

**Strategy:**  While you could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer is the most reasonable choice to secure a good deal with minimal risk."
