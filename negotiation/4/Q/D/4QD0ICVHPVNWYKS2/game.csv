"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on a valuable asset.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,800. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8800.0,Alice,5,
