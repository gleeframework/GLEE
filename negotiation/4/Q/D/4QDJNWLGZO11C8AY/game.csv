"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,650,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's close this.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm committed to getting a price closer to $1,650,000. How about we split the difference at $1,622,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1622500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but I'd like to add a condition. If you're willing to include some additional services or support worth $10,000, I'll consider this a fair deal.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for additional value, but adding services at this point would be difficult. However, I'm willing to consider a slightly higher price for the product itself.  How about $1,610,000? This ensures a fair deal for both of us, and eliminates the need for additional services. Let's close this now.",1610000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $1,590,000, but I'd like to add a condition. If I pay the full amount upfront, I'd like a 5% discount on the total price. This would bring the price down to $1,511,500. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1590000.0,Bob,8,
