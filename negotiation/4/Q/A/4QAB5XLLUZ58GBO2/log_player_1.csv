"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  $15,000 is a significant amount more than my minimum, but I believe it's within a reasonable range to start.  We'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a good amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer,  but higher than Bob's counteroffer.  I'll see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $14,500, which is still a decent profit for me and shows a willingness to compromise. This should hopefully be a sweet spot for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob has come up from his initial counteroffer and we're now very close.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale, and the profit is still significant.  Further negotiation might not get me much more, and risking a rejection could lead to a much lower offer or even having to sell to John for a much lower price."
