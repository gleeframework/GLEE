"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you and we're confident it will meet all your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering $95. This is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target price of $80 (Alice's value)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're starting with a middle ground offer,  testing the waters to see how flexible Alice is. You're showing you're serious about buying, but you're also setting a clear price point that's within your budget and closer to Alice's value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider $90 as a starting point. How about we aim for $88 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue trying to get a price closer to your goal of $80.  You could potentially get even closer to your target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $88 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're continuing to push for a lower price, showing you're committed to getting the best deal possible.  The offer of $85 is a compromise, suggesting you're willing to meet halfway while still maintaining your goal of saving as much money as you can."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your proposal, I'm willing to agree on $86 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $86, which is only $6 more than what the product is worth to her.  This is a good deal for you considering your goal is to spend no more than $100.  Continuing to negotiate might get you a lower price, but there's a risk Alice might walk away, leaving you with no product. It's better to accept the offer and secure the purchase at a good price."
