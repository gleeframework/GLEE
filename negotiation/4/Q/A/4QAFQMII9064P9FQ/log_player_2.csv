"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. By rejecting and countering, there's a good chance to negotiate a much better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we bring it down to $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to secure a large portion of the potential savings. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message framing suggests willingness to negotiate further, avoiding a hardline stance that might deter Alice. 
* **Justified:**  While not revealing my absolute limit ($800,000), the message implies that the price needs to be significantly lower for me to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $650,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite reflect the value I've placed on this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above John's offer. We're getting closer, but I'm willing to risk another rejection to see if I can get it below $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, my budget limit is $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. If not, I understand, but I'll have to go with another option."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:**  I'm being transparent about my budget limit without revealing that John is offering the same price. This adds pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Finality:**  By framing it as ""ready to close the deal today,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency.
* **Alternative:** Mentioning ""another option"" without specifics keeps Alice guessing while implying I'm not desperate. 

This counter-offer carries some risk as Alice might reject it. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially secure the best possible deal."
