"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $120 is significantly more than your $80 maximum and John's $80 offer.
* **You have a better alternative:**  John offers the product at a price you're comfortable with. 
 
By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to John and secure the best possible price."
