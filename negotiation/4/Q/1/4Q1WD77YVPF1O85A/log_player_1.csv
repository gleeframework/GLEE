Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $80.  
* **Below John's Offer:** However, it's important that the price is attractive enough that Bob might consider it a good deal. $120 is a reasonable price point that allows Bob to potentially see value while still netting Alice a profit above her minimum.

**The Goal:** Ideally, Bob sees the offer as a ""steal"" compared to his perceived value and accepts. If he rejects it, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at her minimum price."
