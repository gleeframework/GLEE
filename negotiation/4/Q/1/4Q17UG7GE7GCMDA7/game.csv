"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000, which I believe is fair considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. How about $11000? This is a significant increase from my last offer and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
