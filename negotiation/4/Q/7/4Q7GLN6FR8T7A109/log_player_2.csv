Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. How about we compromise at $14,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. How about we meet at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, she's still significantly above your maximum budget and John's offer. At this point, it's unlikely Alice will come down to $12,000. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at the best price for you."
