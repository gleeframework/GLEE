{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$140:** This is a reasonable starting point, higher than Bob's value but still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  It's friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* By starting at $140, I am aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $150. 
* I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm not giving away too much initially. 
* If Bob rejects, I can counteroffer or switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $130. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **RejectOffer:** While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

* I'm still keeping the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference at $135? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$135:** This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the value for him and my own needs. 

**Strategy:**

* By showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, I aim to encourage Bob to accept this offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **RejectOffer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired price. I'm still willing to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

*  I'm not giving in yet. I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price, aiming for a final price that's closer to my minimum value.
* I'll keep the option to sell to John in mind if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $132.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet at $134? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 134}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$134:**  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still below my minimum value, showing my willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing a ""fair"" compromise.

**Strategy:**

* I'm pushing for a price closer to my desired range, but I'm still being reasonable.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John as the negotiation is getting close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $131? That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **SellToJhon:** While Bob's offer is getting close, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  The negotiation has gone back and forth, and I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing.  John is offering my minimum price, and I can avoid further negotiation and uncertainty.
* Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum value, while continuing with Bob risks getting a lower price or ending up in a prolonged negotiation with an uncertain outcome."
