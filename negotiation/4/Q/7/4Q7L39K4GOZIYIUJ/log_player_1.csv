Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range very profitable for Alice.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives Alice leverage.  She doesn't *need* to go below that price. 

**The offer is structured to be:**

* **Confident:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection"" shows belief in the product's worth.
* **Direct:**  Bob knows exactly what Alice is proposing.
* **Open to Discussion:** While a specific price is given, the tone implies willingness to discuss if Bob has concerns."
