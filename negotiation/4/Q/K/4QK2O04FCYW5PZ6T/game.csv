"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer at $790,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",790000.0,Alice,5,
