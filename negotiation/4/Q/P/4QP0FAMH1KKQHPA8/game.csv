"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,125?  This would allow me to make a fair profit, and you'd still be getting a great value on the product. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",8125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. To be honest, my absolute limit is $8,000. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",8000.0,Bob,6,
