"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still significantly more than Bob's desired price of $8,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a relatively low counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $12,000, but it leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob has the option to buy from John for $8,000, so he's willing to walk away if the price doesn't come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $10,500, Bob is still determined to get the product for closer to his $8,000 target.  Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise. It's a significant increase from his previous offer of $8,500, but it's still a lower price than Alice's latest offer of $10,500. This shows Alice that Bob is willing to negotiate but isn't desperate to accept her price. It also keeps him closer to his target price of $8,000, while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's target price, he's still determined to save as much money as possible.  He's already demonstrated he's willing to negotiate and is prepared to walk away if the price doesn't come down further.  Rejecting this offer gives him the opportunity to potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise. It's a significant increase from his previous offer of $9,000, showing Alice he's willing to move closer to her price.  However, it's still lower than her current offer of $10,000. This continues to demonstrate his willingness to negotiate, while keeping him closer to his desired price of $8,000.  This offer leaves room for further negotiation, but also positions Bob to potentially close the deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000.  While $9,750 is better than previous offers, there's still room for negotiation. He has a backup option to buy from John, so he can afford to be patient and continue bargaining.  Rejecting this offer could lead to a final deal closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,250 is a small increase from his previous offer, showing Alice that he's serious about reaching a deal. However, it still leaves room for a little more negotiation. This offer positions Bob to potentially close the deal in the next round, but also allows him to walk away if the price doesn't come down further. Remember, he has the option to buy from John for $8,000, so he has the upper hand in this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now in a tough spot. He's only got one round left and Alice is unlikely to go lower.  While $9,500 is still more than his ideal price of $8,000, it's a significant improvement from previous offers, and it's the best deal he's likely to get.  Accepting this offer allows him to secure the product and avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price.  He's also saved a substantial amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer."
