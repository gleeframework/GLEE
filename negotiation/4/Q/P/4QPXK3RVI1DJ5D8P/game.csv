"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  I think this is a fair price, considering the product is worth less to me than it is to you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
