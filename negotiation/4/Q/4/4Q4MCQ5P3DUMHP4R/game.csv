"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. This is still a good price for both of us, as it's well above what I would pay elsewhere.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can do $16,000, which is still a great price for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Plus, it's a one-time offer, so you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can manage.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14,500? This would allow me to buy the product without going over my budget and still give you a good profit.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're willing to pay a good price, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $15,500, which is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value to you is $12,000, and it's still a great deal for you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
