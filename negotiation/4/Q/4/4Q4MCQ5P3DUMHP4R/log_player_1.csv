Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. This is still a good price for both of us, as it's well above what I would pay elsewhere.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

How about $14,500? This would allow me to buy the product without going over my budget and still give you a good profit.
