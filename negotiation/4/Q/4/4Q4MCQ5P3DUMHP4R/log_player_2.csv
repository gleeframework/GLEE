"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can do $16,000, which is still a great price for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Plus, it's a one-time offer, so you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate further.  There's a good chance Alice will come down further to make a deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can manage.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14,500? This would allow me to buy the product without going over my budget and still give you a good profit."", ""product_price"": 14500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're willing to pay a good price, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $15,500, which is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value to you is $12,000, and it's still a great deal for you.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. Alice's offer is still above his maximum budget, and while it's possible she might come down further, there's no guarantee.  He's already been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely he'll get a better deal than John's offer."
