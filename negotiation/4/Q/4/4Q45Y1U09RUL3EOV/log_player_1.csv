Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it also signals that I'm serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering the price to $120, which is still above what the product is worth to Bob, but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $100 is still below what I'd ideally like, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks him walking away completely, leaving me with John's offer of $150. It's better to secure a sale at $100 than risk getting nothing."
