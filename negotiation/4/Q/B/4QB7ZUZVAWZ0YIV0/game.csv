"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
