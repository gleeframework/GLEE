{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than your minimum.  This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$800,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept such a drastic reduction in price.  I need to find a compromise closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
