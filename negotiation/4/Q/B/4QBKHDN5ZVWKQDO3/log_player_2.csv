"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since I have a backup option (John) at $1,200,000, there's no reason to accept this offer. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product, but I'm open to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  This price is still fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is being more flexible, $1,100,000 is still higher than my desired price. I'm still aiming for a lower price and have more rounds to negotiate. There's no need to rush into this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm also committed to getting a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This price is a good compromise that ensures we both benefit from this deal. Let's close this transaction and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within my budget and is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or I might end up buying from John for a higher price. It's better to secure this deal at a price that's reasonable for both of us."
