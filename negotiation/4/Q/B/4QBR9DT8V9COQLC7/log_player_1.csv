Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $1,100,000:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** We leave room for negotiation but start at a point significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Minimal Risk:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we still have John as a guaranteed buyer at our desired price.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
