"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000 for the product. It's a great item, but that's my current budget.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 truly represents a fair price considering the value this product brings.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,225,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $1,175,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm serious about purchasing the product.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
