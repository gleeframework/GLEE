``` 
Let's start high to test Bob's willingness to pay.  Even if it's a bit ambitious, it gives us room to negotiate down and potentially secure a price significantly higher than our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet Bob halfway between our offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $12,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"",
""product_price"": 15000
} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $13,000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground, and $13,000 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's a good point to accept and close the deal."
