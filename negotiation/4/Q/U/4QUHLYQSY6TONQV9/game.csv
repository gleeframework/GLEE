"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially setting the price at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you. This offer is at the upper limit of what I can afford, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down on your price, $2,000,000 is still above my maximum.  I'm going to need to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. This is my absolute ceiling, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Let's meet halfway.  How about $1,425,000? This would be a significant compromise on my end, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal, and I believe it represents a fair and reasonable offer.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
