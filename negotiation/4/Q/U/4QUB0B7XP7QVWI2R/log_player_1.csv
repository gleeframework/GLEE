{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob off.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $120. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest! However, $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm confident you'll find this product is worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $120. Could you consider going down to $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm confident that I can't get much more than this from him. It's better to accept his offer and make $125 than to risk losing the sale and only getting $120 from John."
