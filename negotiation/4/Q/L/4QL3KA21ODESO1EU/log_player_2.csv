"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $920,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $710,000 is cutting it close, but I'm ready to close this deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $815,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $815,000.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her ""final offer."" John provides a guaranteed price at your target maximum."
