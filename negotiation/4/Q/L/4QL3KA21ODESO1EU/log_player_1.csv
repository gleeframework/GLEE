Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $920,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $710,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $710,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $710,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's worth seeing if we can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $710,000 is cutting it close, but I'm ready to close this deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $815,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 815000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're getting very close to John's offer, and continuing to push Bob risks losing the deal. By presenting this as our ""final offer"" and splitting the difference, we're signaling firmness while still leaving room for Bob to accept a price above our fallback option."
