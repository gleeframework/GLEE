"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By opening with a price significantly higher than even my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), I aim to establish a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price provides ample room for me to negotiate down while still potentially securing a deal significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can be persuasive. 

It's important to note:  While I have John as a backup offer, my goal is to maximize profit.  I'll carefully consider Bob's responses and adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's start with this figure and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value ($1,000,000), it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  

I'll reject his offer and present a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to my desired range, but still leaves room for some compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,300,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's consider $1,900,000. This offer reflects a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's inherent worth."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, the new price remains well above my $1,500,000 minimum and provides room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns. This attempts to maintain a balance between firmness on price and a willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to the middle ground between our respective starting points."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could stall. 

Accepting this offer secures a significant profit ($400,000 above my minimum) and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
