"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's start with this figure and see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,300,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's consider $1,900,000. This offer reflects a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's inherent worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
