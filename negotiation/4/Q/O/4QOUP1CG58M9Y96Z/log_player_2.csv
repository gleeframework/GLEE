"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget of $8,000 as possible.  This initial counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's asking price, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate.  Starting with a lower offer increases the chance of Alice accepting, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget.  There are still rounds remaining, and Bob can continue to negotiate with Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob maintains leverage and can attempt to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to his target price, but still needs to be mindful of his budget.  This counteroffer is a compromise, suggesting a willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still trying to secure a better deal. It leaves room for a final negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $750 below Bob's maximum budget, and with only 5 rounds remaining, there's not much room for further negotiation. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product at a known price from John, ensuring he stays within his budget.  There's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, leading to a stalemate or a higher price, which is undesirable."
