Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also sets the stage for a potentially profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get more, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth risking a longer negotiation when I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
