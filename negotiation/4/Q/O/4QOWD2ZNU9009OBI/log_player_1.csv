"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know you'd gain significant value from it. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair starting point given its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""significant value"" Bob would gain, I'm subtly reminding him of the product's worth to him, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording ""fair starting point"" signals that I'm open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good profit, I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob. We're still early in the negotiation, and his offer is significantly below his perceived value of the product. I'm willing to counter to steer the negotiation closer to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While $900,000 is tempting, the value this product brings to your specific needs is substantial.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Countering:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer to show I'm taking his input seriously. However, I'm countering with a price significantly higher than his while still moving towards a compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the value proposition specifically for Bob. This reminds him why he's interested and potentially justifies a higher price in his mind.
* **""Meeting in the middle"":** This framing suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise, even though the proposed price is still heavily in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $950,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $950,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has signaled this is his highest offer with the phrase ""the highest I can go.""  Pushing further might make him walk away.
* **Time Value:** While I have more rounds, securing the deal now avoids the risk of further negotiation or Bob changing his mind. 
 
It's always tempting to push for more, but this feels like the right balance of risk and reward at this point."
