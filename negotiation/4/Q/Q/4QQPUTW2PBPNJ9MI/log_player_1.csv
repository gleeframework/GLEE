"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and a great value for the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I've done some research and I believe the market value of the product is around that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is still better than selling to John for $8,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $9,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you've done your research and I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm firm on my product's value and am willing to come down to $8,500.  This price still allows me to make a profit and hopefully it's a fair compromise for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting too low for me.  Even though I'm only making $8,000 selling to John, it's a more secure deal and I don't want to risk going lower and losing out on a better price."
