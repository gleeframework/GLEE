"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
