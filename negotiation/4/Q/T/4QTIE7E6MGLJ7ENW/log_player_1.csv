"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Leaving Room:**  I don't want to start too low and undervalue the product.  
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is good, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'm willing to push a little further in the next round to see if I can secure a higher profit margin. Selling to John is a last resort at this point since Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate in the range I'm targeting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. To find a middle ground, how about we settle on $1,125,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price halfway between our previous offers. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price point.
* **Justifying the Value:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its worth and why my offer is reasonable.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I want to keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think $1,100,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,115,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,115,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,115,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has consistently moved closer to my desired range, indicating a genuine interest in closing the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out further increases the risk of Bob losing interest or finding alternative options.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
