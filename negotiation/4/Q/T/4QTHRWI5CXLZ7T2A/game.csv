"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially setting the price at $12,000. What are your thoughts on this?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $12,000 for the product. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $10,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $9,000? This is a very fair price for this product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $8,250. This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,6,
