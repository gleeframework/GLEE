{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After reviewing your proposal, I am pleased to offer the product to you at a price of $1,300,000. This is a competitive offer that reflects the value of the product while allowing us to meet our sales objectives. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to push the price lower.  If he accepts this offer, he won't be saving as much as he could."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of this, I am prepared to offer the product to you at a price of $1,285,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions and allows us to move forward with the transaction. I hope this offer meets your expectations and enables us to finalize this agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,285,000, which is only $85,000 above Bob's maximum budget. At this point, it's worth it for Bob to accept the offer.  While he could potentially negotiate a lower price, it's likely that Alice won't go lower and Bob could end up losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price."
