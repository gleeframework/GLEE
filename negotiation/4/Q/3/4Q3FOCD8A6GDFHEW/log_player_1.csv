Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but still allows me to make a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $175 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm offering $190. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $180. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is still a good deal for me, earning more than my minimum and avoiding the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
