"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a good deal for you.  Let's close this deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $10,800?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",10800.0,Bob,6,
