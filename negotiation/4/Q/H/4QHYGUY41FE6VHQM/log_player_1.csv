"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a high price early on.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I need to consider the value of the product to me, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm aiming to find a middle ground and see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would have liked to get more, accepting this offer ensures I don't lose out on a sale. It's a good deal considering my other option is to sell to John for the same price."
