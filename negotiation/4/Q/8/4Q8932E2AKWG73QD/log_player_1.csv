"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to gauge his interest and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for me, but also a more realistic price point considering Bob's initial offer.  This shows good faith in the negotiation while also maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $950,000.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying close to my desired price.  I believe this could be a sweet spot for Bob to accept, especially since he's already shown a willingness to go up to $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is very close to my desired price, I still believe I can get a little closer to my target. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000} 
```

I'm raising the price just a bit more to $940,000. It's a small increase, but it shows that I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and agree to the deal."
