"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000.  This price still allows me to achieve a fair return while acknowledging your needs.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm proposing $1,025,000.  This is a reasonable middle ground that allows us both to achieve a favorable outcome.  Let's settle this and move forward.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
