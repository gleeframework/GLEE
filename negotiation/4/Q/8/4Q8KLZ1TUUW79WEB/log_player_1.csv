Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob and make the negotiation more pleasant.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm inviting Bob to respond and begin the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to come down to $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is a decent offer, I'm holding out for a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my starting price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $75 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $75.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still get a decent price.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and constructive.
* **Motivating Reason:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, ""we both get a good deal,"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $87.50 is still a little higher than my budget allows. How about we settle on $82.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $82.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that he'll walk away, and I'd be left with only John's offer of $80.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale above my minimum and avoids the risk of a further negotiation breakdown."
