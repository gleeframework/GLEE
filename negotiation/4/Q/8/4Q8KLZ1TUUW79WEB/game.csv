,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to come down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $75 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $87.50 is still a little higher than my budget allows. How about we settle on $82.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase.",82.5,Bob,4,
