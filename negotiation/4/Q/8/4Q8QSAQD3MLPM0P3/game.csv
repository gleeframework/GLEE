"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product. Let's find a middle ground.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the lowest price I can offer while still making a decent profit.",17000.0,Alice,5,
