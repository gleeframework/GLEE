Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering the product at $850,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're finding the offer more appealing, Bob. Considering your feedback, how about we finalize the deal at $840,000?

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and the price difference is getting smaller. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and risking a higher price by going another round with a counteroffer might end up costing more than accepting the current deal."
