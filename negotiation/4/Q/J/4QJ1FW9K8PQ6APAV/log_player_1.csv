Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob directly avoids the potential delay of going to John, even though John offers a guaranteed sale.

This strategy aims to secure a significantly higher profit than the guaranteed $800,000 while still presenting an attractive offer to Bob."
