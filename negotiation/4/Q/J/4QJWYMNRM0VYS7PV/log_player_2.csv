"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above her value of $1,200,000, but still too high for Bob. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price. There's potential to save money by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to save even more.  Given the product's value to me and your own valuation, I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000.  This price reflects a fair deal for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,250,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's target price of $1,150,000 and only $100,000 more than Alice's own valuation. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation might not be worth the risk of Alice backing out or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer is the most reasonable choice for Bob."
