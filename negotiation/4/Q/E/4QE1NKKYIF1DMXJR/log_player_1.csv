Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $950,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
