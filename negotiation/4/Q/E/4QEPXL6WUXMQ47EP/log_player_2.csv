Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that considers its value to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. However, I need to be realistic about the product's value. I can go as low as $875,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum price point. You have the option to buy from John for $800,000, saving you $75,000. Since Alice has stated this is her final offer, there's no guarantee you can negotiate a better price. It makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point."
