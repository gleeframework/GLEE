"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
