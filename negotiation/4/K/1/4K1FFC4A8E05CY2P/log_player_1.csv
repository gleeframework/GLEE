{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is my starting point. I'm aware the product is worth $80 to Bob, but I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $150. I'm starting high to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for it. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $120. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go above $80. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $80 offer.  While I'd prefer to make a profit, selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
