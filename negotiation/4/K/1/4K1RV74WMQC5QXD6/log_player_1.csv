Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a good starting point as it's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable.  I'm confident that Bob will either accept or counter with a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $7,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I will counter with a more reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is still a good profit for me and a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob.  I'm confident that he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed $8,000, which is a better deal than the risk of Bob continuing to lower his offer."
