"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I highlight the product's value to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure the highest possible price, but also avoid a drawn-out negotiation that risks Bob walking away. By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to come up to a price closer to my desired value.  I also keep in mind the backup option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value.**  While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need to make this worthwhile.  
* **I'm holding out for a better deal.** I have 9 more rounds, and I'm confident I can push Bob higher or secure the $1,500,000 deal with John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll also emphasize the value of the product and the limited opportunity for Bob to acquire it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $1,400,000 is simply not enough to cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but only to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and potential.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I've countered Bob's offer, but I've kept the price significantly higher than his initial offer. This shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm also willing to compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I've re-emphasized the value of the product to justify the higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I've maintained a positive and collaborative tone, reminding Bob that I want to reach a deal.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to gradually reduce my price while keeping it above Bob's perceived value. By showing a willingness to compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to increase his offer. If he doesn't, I still have the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.**  While I initially hoped for a higher price, Bob's offer matches my backup option of selling to John. 
* **Accepting avoids further negotiation.**  There's no guarantee I can get a better price in the remaining rounds, and I risk losing the deal altogether.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a fair price and avoid unnecessary risk. I've successfully negotiated a price that meets my minimum requirements and maximizes my profit."
