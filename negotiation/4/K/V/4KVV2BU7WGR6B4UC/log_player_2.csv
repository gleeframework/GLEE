"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum. There's room to negotiate further. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his maximum budget as possible. This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than Bob's maximum price with John.  This is a starting point for negotiations and allows for room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,380,000 is closer to Bob's maximum price, he can still try to negotiate further.  Bob is only $180,000 away from his ideal price with John, so there's still room to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to bridge the gap between his ideal price and Alice's offer. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to pay more than his initial offer, but still below Alice's latest offer.  This approach aims to find a middle ground and hopefully secure a deal closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is only $50,000 more than Bob's maximum price with John. This is a small difference, and further negotiation might not be worth the time and risk. It's more beneficial for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product for a price close to his maximum limit."
