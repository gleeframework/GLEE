Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to Bob's value.  This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for us to come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. There's still a good chance we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a significant profit and leaves some room for further discussion.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $1,025,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than selling to John and still leaves Bob with a sizable profit.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even no deal at all."
