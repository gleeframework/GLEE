"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a significant profit and leaves some room for further discussion.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
