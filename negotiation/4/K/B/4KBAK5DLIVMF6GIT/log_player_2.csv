It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a lower price, especially when you have a backup option.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if you can get a better deal with Alice."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also sets the stage for further negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $950,000 is a good price. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more or having to buy from John at a higher price."
