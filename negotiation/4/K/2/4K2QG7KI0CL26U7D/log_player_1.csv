"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate towards that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet halfway. However, I still believe we can find a price closer to my limit. How about $9,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

``` 
At this point, Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate might get me a little more, but there's also the risk he walks away. Taking the $9,500 is a safe bet to ensure a good profit.
