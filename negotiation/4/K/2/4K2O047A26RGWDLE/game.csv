"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $20000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $16000. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me at $16000, but I still need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $18000? It's a fair price, and I'm willing to give you a bit of a discount from my previous offer.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm making a compromise, and I'm offering it to you at this price. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging any further.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000, Bob. I've already met you at that price, and I'm not budging. However, I'm willing to give you a small concession. I'll meet you halfway between $14000 and $13000, which is $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm not going any lower.",13500.0,Alice,9,
