"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I think $10,000 is the maximum I can offer. Could you possibly meet me halfway at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,750. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,6,
