"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",800000.0,Alice,3,
