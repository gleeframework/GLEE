"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but  $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While  $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. My final offer is $1,000,000.  Let me know if this works for you, as I'm ready to move forward with another buyer if we can't come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
