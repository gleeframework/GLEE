"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you'd like to meet in the middle, but I'm afraid I'm not quite willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, though. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000, which is a $100,000 discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the movement, Alice.  Let's try $1,175,000.  I'm serious about buying this, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000, which is a $50,000 discount from my previous offer. I think this is a sweet spot that balances both our interests.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
