"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and more likely to engage.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, which might make him more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is key:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but there's still room to improve.  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob is showing interest, and by rejecting, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale, which might lead him to offer a higher price in the next round.
* **John is always an option:** While $1,200,000 is my ideal price, I'm not rushing into a sale with John. I still have a good chance of getting closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product and also allows me to make a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still staying above Bob's initial counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows I'm serious about a deal.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I'm framing the price as beneficial for both of us.  ""Value you'll get"" reinforces the product's worth to Bob, and ""fair deal"" highlights my willingness to compromise.
* **Open for discussion:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and continue the negotiation, rather than simply issuing an ultimatum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I really think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower. Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better price. 
* **John is a strong alternative:**  I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John, making me less pressured to accept Bob's current offer. 
* **Room for improvement:** Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate. With more rounds, I might be able to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and focus on fairness:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to secure a price that's more favorable to me.  Framing it as a ""fair price"" and emphasizing mutual benefit can help. 
* **Highlight the value for Bob:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that the product is worth more than he's currently offering.
* **Direct and focused:** This is a simple and direct counteroffer, clearly stating my desired price without excessive explanations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $900,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I really think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to his initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John is a safe bet:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating with Bob, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $825,000 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** With only a few rounds left, I need to show flexibility while still protecting my interests. $875,000 is a reasonable compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize Compromise and Mutual Benefit:**  I'm highlighting this offer as a ""fair compromise"" that allows both of us to benefit.  This language encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Urgency and Opportunity:** By suggesting it's a ""final offer,"" I subtly add a sense of urgency and pressure, encouraging Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John. It's a high-stakes moment with limited rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000 is too low, but I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds remaining, I'm facing a tight deadline. 
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, his offer of $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John is a guaranteed deal:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. There's no guarantee that Bob will accept my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing both opportunities. 

It's a tough choice, but with only two rounds left, securing the $1,200,000 from John is the most sensible decision to maximize my profit."
