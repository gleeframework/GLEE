Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let's start the negotiations off strong! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,100,000 for this product. It's still a good deal for both of us, and lets us both get what we want. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still allows us both to make a profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer again and hopefully reach a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This price is a fair compromise and ensures a smooth transaction for both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly your maximum budget, making it a good deal for you.  You are not likely to get a better price from Alice, and going to John would result in the same price.  It's wise to accept the offer and close the deal."
