Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, $8,200 is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for anything significantly below my initial offer.  Let's see what we can do in the next round."

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.
