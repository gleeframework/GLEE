Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $14,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
