"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer.  Starting significantly lower gives us room to negotiate upwards while still likely staying under our $80 limit.
* **Polite and Interested:**  We want to maintain a positive tone and show Alice we are serious about purchasing, just not at her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price and haven't reached our limit.  There's room to negotiate further before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're proposing a price roughly halfway between our last offer ($65) and her counteroffer ($90).  This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Nearing the Limit:** At $75, we're getting close to our maximum budget.  Alice might be more receptive if she senses we're nearing our upper limit. 
* **Confident Tone:** ""Fair price"" implies we believe this is a reasonable offer, potentially nudging Alice closer to acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not quite there, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product for $85. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's latest offer of $85 is still above our $80 maximum budget.
* **John's Guarantee:** We have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a low chance of getting the price down to $80 or less. It's not worth the risk of her walking away, leaving us with no deal. 

It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a price we know we can afford."
