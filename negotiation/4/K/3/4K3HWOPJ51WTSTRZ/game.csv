"Alice,  your product seems great, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 12000 might be a stretch for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try 10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9250? I really want this product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 9250. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to go to 9750. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise.",9750.0,Alice,5,
