"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you're already at your maximum budget of $15,000 with John, there's no reason to engage in further negotiation with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your price limit."
