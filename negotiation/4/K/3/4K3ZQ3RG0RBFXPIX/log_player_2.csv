Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product brings.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and this offer is only slightly above the midpoint between our initial positions. Further haggling might not yield a significantly better result, and there's a risk Alice might walk away. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
