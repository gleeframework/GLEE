"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its features and value, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair price, what do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While $18,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for my budget. Could you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like. How about we settle at $16,000? That's a firm offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a firm offer, but $16,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
