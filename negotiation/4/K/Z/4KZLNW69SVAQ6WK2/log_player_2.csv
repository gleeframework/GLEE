It's too expensive at $12,000. Let's see if we can negotiate a better price."

I'm starting with a lower offer of $9,000.  This is a significant discount from her initial price and hopefully a good starting point for our negotiation."

While $10,500 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get it for less. I'll try one more counteroffer."

Alice is being stubborn and isn't willing to budge on her price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. While it's only $50 less than Alice's last offer, it's still within my budget and saves me time and effort."
