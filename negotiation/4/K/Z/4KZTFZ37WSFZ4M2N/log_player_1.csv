Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $18,000. This allows for some room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit beyond my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'm hoping Bob values the product significantly higher than my minimum and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm counteroffering with $15,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle and avoid selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. There's no reason to continue negotiating, as further rounds could lead to lower offers, and I would be better off accepting his offer and selling the product to him."
