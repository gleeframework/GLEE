Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer starts at $1,400,000, leaving a significant margin for negotiation while still being considerably higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.  This approach aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** A $1,400,000 sale is closer to my desired value of $1,500,000.
* **Encourage negotiation:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving us the opportunity to find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Avoid immediate fallback:**  This offer is higher than John's $1,500,000 offer, so it's not immediately advantageous to sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and the potential for further negotiation. If he counters too low, I'll prepare a counter-counteroffer.  If the negotiation stalls or becomes unfavorable, I'll turn to John to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my desired value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round for these reasons:

* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  I believe there's still room to reach a more favorable price.
* **John as Backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000, which acts as a safety net. This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's offer and my own desired value. I'll likely make a counteroffer closer to my original $1,400,000 mark, but I'll be flexible based on Bob's counteroffer and my assessment of his willingness to negotiate further. If negotiations stall or become unfavorable, I'll switch to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $1,300,000 to Bob. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer of $1,400,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  

Here's why I chose this amount:

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This price is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a genuine effort to meet in the middle.
* **Maintaining Value:** It still leaves a significant margin for me, but it's closer to Bob's perceived value, potentially making it more attractive.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price. If he rejects, I'll know that further concessions might be necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great!  If he rejects, I'll assess his counter-counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting too close to his perceived value and further away from my desired price of $1,500,000.  While further negotiation is possible, I believe the risk of a prolonged and ultimately unsuccessful negotiation outweighs the potential gain.

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Guaranteed Value:** John offers a guaranteed sale for $1,500,000. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation, which could result in a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Time Value:** The back-and-forth with Bob has already taken time and effort. Selling to John allows me to move on and focus on other opportunities.
* **Minimizing Losses:** While I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting John's offer still yields a significant profit.

**Next Steps:**

I'll complete the transaction with John and secure my $1,500,000 sale. I'll learn from this experience and consider different negotiation strategies for future deals."
