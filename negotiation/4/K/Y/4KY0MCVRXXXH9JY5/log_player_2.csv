"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $100 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $92. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since there's still a significant difference between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a counteroffer, but it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. It's a fair price that's close to my budget, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $88 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $90. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price, and while $90 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit of $80. It's no longer beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice, as she's unlikely to go lower.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $80, ensuring he stays within his budget and secures the product."
