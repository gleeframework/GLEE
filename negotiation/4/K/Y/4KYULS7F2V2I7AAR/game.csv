"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1000000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I need to ensure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1100000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to achieve our desired outcomes.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need to make a slight adjustment to ensure I break even. I'm counteroffering at $1060000. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept without losing money on the deal.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to break even. However, $1060000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1030000, but that's my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we are both approaching a compromise.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1030000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1050000, the same price I offered in Round 5. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
