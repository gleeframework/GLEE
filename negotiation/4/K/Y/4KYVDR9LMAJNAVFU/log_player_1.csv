This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my $10,000 valuation, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still too low. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for less than $9,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8750? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm really interested in making a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach a compromise.  If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
