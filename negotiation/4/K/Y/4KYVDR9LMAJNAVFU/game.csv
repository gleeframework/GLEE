"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though.  How about $9000? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8750? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm really interested in making a deal with you.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I really want to make this deal work, but $8750 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $8900. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product, and a great opportunity for you.  If you're serious about this, this is my final offer.",8900.0,Alice,5,
