"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget of $10,000. It's always good to negotiate, especially when the seller acknowledges their own value for the product.  You have a better alternative with John at $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is a smart strategy."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product to you for $13000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to me is at least $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You have a better alternative with John, who is selling the product for $10,000.  It's worth negotiating further with Alice, but you are in a strong position with your backup option.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer allows you to explore if a more agreeable price is possible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll consider selling the product to you for $12500. This is still a good deal for me, considering its value to me is at least $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to your budget, it's still $2,500 above what you're willing to pay.  John offers the same product for $10,000, so it makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price, but ultimately, you have a solid alternative.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer allows you to explore if a price closer to your budget is possible."

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your compromise, $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.

Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,200 is still above your budget.  You have a solid alternative with John offering the same product for $10,000. While continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a slightly better price, it's not worth the risk of going over your budget or wasting more time.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price point."
