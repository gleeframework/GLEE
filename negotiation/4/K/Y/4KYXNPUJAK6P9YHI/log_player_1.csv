Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $15,000 for it. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $15,000 gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. 
* **Positive Framing:** I highlight the product's value to me and frame the price as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price, which keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $10,000, and $12,000 is still a bit too low.
* **Negotiation:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price by counter-offering. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, I believe there's a chance I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair compromise given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a price we both feel good about."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, acknowledging his offer but suggesting a price that's closer to my desired range. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. How about $12500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $12,500 is getting close to my minimum value of $10,000.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob is willing to meet me halfway, indicating a genuine interest in the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. 
* **Time Factor:**  Negotiating further might take more time, and I might lose out on opportunities with other potential buyers."
