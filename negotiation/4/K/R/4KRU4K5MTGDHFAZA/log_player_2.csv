# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $10000 is still a bit low for me.

Round 7

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $12200? It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200.
