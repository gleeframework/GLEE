Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my potential profit and securing a sale. 

Here's why:

* **Profit:**  Selling to Bob for $9,000 still gives me a profit of $1,000, which is better than selling to John for $10,000. 
* **Risk:**  There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but since it's only $1,000 less than his perceived value, it's a reasonable price for him to consider. 
* **Backup:**  If Bob does reject, I have a guaranteed sale with John for my desired minimum price."
