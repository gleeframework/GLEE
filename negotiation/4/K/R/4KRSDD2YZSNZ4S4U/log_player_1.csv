{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal and I think it's worth the price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above Bob's value of $8,000 but below my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product and framing the price as a ""great deal."" This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product for a good price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing profit and the potential alternative sale to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise that's still above Bob's offer but closer to his range. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but reiterating my stance on the minimum price. I'm framing the counteroffer as a good deal for him, appealing to his potential value and encouraging further negotiation.  

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price and successfully negotiated a deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth accepting or if I should stick to my price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $9,000, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $12,000.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, or if not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,500 to make this deal work. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to fairly compensate for the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still maintains a fair value for me. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but firmly stating my minimum price. I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good price and successfully negotiated a deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have no choice but to sell to John for $12,000."
