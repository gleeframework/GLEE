"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal and I think it's worth the price. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,500 to make this deal work. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to fairly compensate for the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
