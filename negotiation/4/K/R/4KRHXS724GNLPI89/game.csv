"I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but I'd like to propose a small incentive for a quick decision. If we can finalize the deal within the next 2 rounds, I'm willing to accept a 1% discount on the price. That would bring the price down to $907,250. If we don't meet that deadline, I'm willing to accept $915,000 as the final price. What do you think?",907250.0,Bob,6,
