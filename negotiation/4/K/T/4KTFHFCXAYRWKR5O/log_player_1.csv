"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my price accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $18,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and hopefully, it's more appealing to Bob.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm getting close to running out of rounds, I believe I can still get a better price than $9,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $16,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still making a profit. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a price that Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, Bob is clearly not willing to pay a fair price.  I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing even more money.  It's time to sell to John for $15,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a reasonable profit and guarantees a sale."
