"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $900000. I think this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I recognize its value, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. How about $800000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $800000 is still a bit high for me, though.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $700000.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount. Let me know if you're open to it.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $700000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $750000? It's a small increase from your offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
