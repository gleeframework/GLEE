Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go up to $100, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go down to $100. It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
