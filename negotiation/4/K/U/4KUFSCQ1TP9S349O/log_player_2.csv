Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,750 and $8,200. How about $7,975?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $7,900.  Since your goal is to buy for no more than $8,000 and you have the option from John at that price, it's best to cut your losses and buy from John."
