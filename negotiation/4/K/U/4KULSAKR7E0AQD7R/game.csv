"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. That's a reasonable compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,100,000.  This is a fair offer and would save me a considerable amount compared to John's offer.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,110,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1110000.0,Alice,7,
