"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is still a good deal for you considering the product's value and my own costs. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too far from my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, and propose a final offer of $1,237,500.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows for a successful deal.  I believe it's in our best interest to close this transaction now. ",1237500.0,Alice,5,
