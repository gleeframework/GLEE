{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $170.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and positive to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's a significant gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers and negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, providing a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Although Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiations with Bob fail. This provides a backup option and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to drop the price to $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering the price from my initial offer.  
* **Fair Offer:** $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's a more realistic starting point for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the door open for further discussion.
* **Leaving Room:** There's still space for Bob to counter if he wants, but my offer is significantly closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $100. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's closer, accepting it would still result in a loss.
* **Potential for better deal:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate.  There's a good chance I can push him higher with a counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:**  The guarantee of selling to John for $150 gives me the confidence to be more assertive in negotiations. 

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $100 is getting closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Strategic Price:** $110 is a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer and is closer to my target price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep negotiations open.
* **Final Push:**  This offer might be the last counteroffer I make before considering selling to John. I'm pushing for a final decision from Bob."
