"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. It's worth more to you than to me, and I'm confident you'll get great value out of it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. You know Alice values the product at $10,000 and you have John as a backup option at $15,000. By rejecting this offer, you can try to get Alice to come down closer to her value."
