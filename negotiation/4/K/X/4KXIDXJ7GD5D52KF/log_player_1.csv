Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:**  The message is positive and highlights the product's potential value to Bob. This may encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, making it clear that I'm open to negotiating the price. 

**Why This Approach?**

* **Maximizing Potential Profit:**  A higher starting price gives me more leverage to negotiate a good deal.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will gauge Bob's interest and give me an idea of his perceived value of the product. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I need to keep in mind that John is willing to pay $15,000, so any offer from Bob below that price isn't worth considering.
* **Bob's Financial Situation:**  If I know Bob has limited funds, I may need to adjust my approach.
* **Product's Uniqueness:**  The more unique the product, the more room I have to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I'd prefer to earn more, selling to Bob for $15,000 is still a good outcome.  It avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown in the deal."
