"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the true value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This takes into account your perspective while still reflecting the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
