Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but not so high as to make it immediately unattractive. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary, but also signals I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than what I initially offered, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm raising my offer slightly to meet Bob halfway, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely I'll get closer to my desired price.  It's more beneficial to sell to John and get my minimum price."
