"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, I'm not comfortable with $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a good offer, it doesn't quite meet my minimum needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's work towards a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still below the value I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's true value and would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
