"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way too high.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but it's worth trying to get a better price.  By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and hopefully get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, I'm not comfortable with $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move. Bob is offering a price that's $300,000 lower than Alice's initial ask.  It's a bold move, but it shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a good offer, it doesn't quite meet my minimum needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit too high. Bob should try to negotiate further. By rejecting, Bob can make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his target price.  It's important to remember that John is a reliable option for Bob if these negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price while showing willingness to compromise.  Bob is now only $100,000 away from Alice's last offer, demonstrating a genuine effort to reach an agreement. This also keeps the possibility of a deal with John as a backup plan in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still below the value I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's true value and would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is the same price as John's. This means Bob can secure the product for his target price. There's no reason to keep negotiating as he has achieved his goal. Accepting the offer allows Bob to close the deal without further risk or delay."
