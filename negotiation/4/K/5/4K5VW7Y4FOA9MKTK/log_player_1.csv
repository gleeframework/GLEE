"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that I can always negotiate down. I'm aiming to see if Bob is interested at all and gauge his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $70 is below my minimum threshold of $80. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $85?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you on the budget, but I'm still trying to get a fair price for this product. Let's split the difference - $81.  This would ensure we both get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 81}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my budget, and I'd love to make a deal. Would you be willing to meet me at $79? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John.  Bob has repeatedly pushed for a price below my minimum, and while his offer is getting close, I'm running out of rounds.  I'd rather secure a guaranteed $80 with John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
