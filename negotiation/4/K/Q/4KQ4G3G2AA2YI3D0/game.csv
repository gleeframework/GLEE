"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to the market value as possible. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a sweet spot at $8,750. Would you be willing to consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's try $8,900.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. I'm willing to make a final offer of $8,700. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",8700.0,Bob,6,
