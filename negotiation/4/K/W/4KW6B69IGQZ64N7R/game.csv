"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Can you meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1550000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1550000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1450000, but I'm starting to think that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere. Can you meet me at this price?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1525000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1525000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1525000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1425000, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1425000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1475000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If we can meet at this price, I'm willing to consider it a successful negotiation. What do you think?",1475000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1475000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000, and I think this is the absolute maximum I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be the better option for me.",1400000.0,Bob,10,
