"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $137.50?",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $135? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $137.50. How about we meet in the middle again, at $136.75? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",136.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $136.75. I'm willing to go up to $134, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",134.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $134, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $138? It's a fair price that should be acceptable to you.",138.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $138. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $134 and $138, which would be $135.50. Can you consider that?",135.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you halfway at $135.50. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $139? It's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",139.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $139. I'm willing to go up to $136, but that's as high as I can go. I think we're getting close to the product's true value, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time. Can you consider $136?",136.0,Bob,10,
