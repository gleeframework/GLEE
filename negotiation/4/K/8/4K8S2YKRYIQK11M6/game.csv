"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. While I value your interest,  $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000, reflecting the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This shows my seriousness in getting this deal done.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
