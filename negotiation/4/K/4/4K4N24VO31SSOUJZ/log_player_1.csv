{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and it's a fair price for me, as I value it at no less than $8,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your position, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value and my own. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm confident I can improve on this offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my own valuation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go to $8,750 for the product. This is closer to your price, but still allows me to save some money. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $9,000. While Bob's offer of $8,750 is tempting, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. $8,750 is getting closer, but I need to get at least $8,900 for the product. This is still a very fair deal for you, considering its value. It's only a small difference, let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
