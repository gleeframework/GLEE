"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is a good offer, it's just a little lower than I can go at this time.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for the value this product offers. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $8,500? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $9,250?  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to make a fair profit and you to get a fantastic product.  Let me know what you think!",9250.0,Alice,5,
