I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still not happy with $10,000. I'm hoping to get him to budge a bit more before I have to resort to selling to John."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and with only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can get him to go any higher.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired price, so it's the best option for me."
