Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but less than the price John is willing to pay. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum.  This shows flexibility while still leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale with John for a price that meets my minimum. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the sale to him entirely or wasting time when I could already have the money from John."
