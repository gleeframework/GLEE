It's a good start, but there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get a lower price from Alice before settling for John's offer."

Alice is holding firm, and this price is close enough to our target to justify taking the deal. It's better to secure the product now at a reasonable price than risk further negotiation or going with John's fixed offer."
