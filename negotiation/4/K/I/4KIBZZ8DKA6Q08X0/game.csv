"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? That's the highest I can go at this point.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This product truly is worth the investment, and I want to make sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $9,800? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",9800.0,Bob,4,
