{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are looking to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer is close to your maximum, but there's room for negotiation.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate.
* $80 is still within my budget, but leaves room for potential compromise. 
* This aggressive counteroffer should encourage Alice to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $85, which is a good price considering my initial goal of $100.
* There's a risk in continuing to negotiate, as Alice might not budge further or I might run out of rounds. 
* Accepting the offer at $85 saves me money and secures the product without risking going over budget."
