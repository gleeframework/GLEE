"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and based on my calculations, a fair starting price would be $2,250,000. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to  $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my initial calculations. To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000. This reflects a considerable reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're making compromises, and I appreciate that. However, we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
