Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is quite high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and returns this product offers. To move forward, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,900,000. This represents a considerable adjustment on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of this product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, we are still pretty far apart. To be frank, I'm only willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has now revealed his maximum valuation of the product ($800,000). While his offer is moving closer to a million, we're still significantly far apart. It's worth attempting to negotiate further before resorting to selling to John, even if it means settling for a price slightly lower than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $700,000 remains significantly below the product's true value.  Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,500,000? This allows me to acknowledge your constraints while ensuring a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're now getting closer to a point where we need to consider John's offer seriously. This counteroffer aims to:

* **Signal firmness:** By holding firm at $1,500,000 (our minimum), we indicate to Bob that this is our walk-away price. 
* **Encourage a serious response:**  The large jump from Bob's offer might encourage him to either reveal his true willingness to pay or make a more substantial counteroffer.
* **Maintain the option of John:** If Bob rejects this offer, we can still accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems we both value this product, but our ideas of a fair price are still quite far apart. I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer, but $1,500,000 is not feasible for me. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limited Movement:**  Bob's offer only increased by $50,000. This suggests he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of not reaching a deal and losing John's guaranteed offer. The potential gain from continuing with Bob is outweighed by the potential loss of $750,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures you receive your minimum acceptable price and maximizes your profit in this scenario."
