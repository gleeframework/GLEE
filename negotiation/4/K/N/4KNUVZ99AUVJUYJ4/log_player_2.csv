"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential of the product, but $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also demonstrating Bob's seriousness in making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $880,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000. While there might be potential to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price within his budget and saves a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John."
