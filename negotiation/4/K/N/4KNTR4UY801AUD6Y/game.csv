"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. My initial counteroffer is $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, given its value to both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,650,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is my best and final offer for now.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
