"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining and hopefully get a higher price.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $90 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be happy to buy it for $75.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $80, so I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate the offer but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $85? Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $85 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference and meet in the middle at $80.  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum threshold of $80. While I'd prefer to get more, there's a risk that rejecting his offer will lead to further rounds of negotiation with an uncertain outcome. Additionally, I can always sell to John for $80 if I don't reach a deal with Bob. It's better to accept this offer and guarantee the sale."
