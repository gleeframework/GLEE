"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? ",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $115 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
