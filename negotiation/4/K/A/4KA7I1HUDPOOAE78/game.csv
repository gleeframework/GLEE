"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is fair given its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can yield a significant return for you. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $2,000,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000. This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,750,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I need to be closer to $1,900,000 for this deal to work for me. Would you be willing to consider that figure?",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit here. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,825,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to buy the product and you to get a reasonable price.",1825000.0,Bob,6,
