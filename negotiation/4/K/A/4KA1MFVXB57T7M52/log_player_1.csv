Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate.  We're aiming for a price above $1,000,000. Accepting $950,000 would be leaving a significant amount on the table. We'll continue the negotiation to try and bridge the gap."
