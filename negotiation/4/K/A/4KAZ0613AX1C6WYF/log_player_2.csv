"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this valuable product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and it will be a significant asset. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a better alternative: buying the product from John for $800,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $100,000 and still acquire the product."
