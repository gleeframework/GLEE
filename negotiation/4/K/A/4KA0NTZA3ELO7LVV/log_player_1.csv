"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price, but one that still leaves some room for negotiation. Bob values the product at $800,000, so I'm offering a price that's significantly higher but still potentially within the range of his willingness to pay. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential earnings:** I'm aiming for the highest possible price in the first round.
* **Set a strong initial bargaining position:** A high initial offer establishes a strong starting point for the negotiation.
* **See if Bob is genuinely interested:** If Bob is willing to pay significantly more than $800,000, then I know he has a high perceived value for the product.

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better price than Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and selling to John is a guaranteed $1,200,000, so it's not worth accepting Bob's offer yet. 

By rejecting, I can:

* **Continue negotiations:**  I can attempt to push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Gain information:**  Bob's counteroffer gives me a clearer understanding of his maximum budget.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting immediately, I show Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my ideal range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still staying significantly higher than Bob's offer.

Here's why:

* **Balancing Compromise and Value:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too much. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate without drastically reducing my profit margin.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness about buying the product. If he's willing to move closer to $1,000,000, it indicates he's committed.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer yet, keeping the pressure on him to increase his bid if he wants the deal.

This approach aims to find a middle ground where both parties can potentially agree, while keeping my earnings as high as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant increase from Bob's previous offer and closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 

Here's why I'm choosing to reject and counteroffer:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I'm not yet desperate enough to accept a price significantly lower than my target.
* **Remaining in Control:** By rejecting, I maintain the negotiating power and can continue to try and push for a better price.
* **Gathering Information:** Bob's increasing offers show his willingness to pay, which gives me valuable insight for my next counteroffer.

My next counteroffer will aim to bridge the gap between our current positions, potentially moving closer to $1,000,000 or even $1,100,000, depending on how strongly I believe Bob is willing to go higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $950,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's latest offer of $900,000. 

Here's why this strategy is beneficial:

* **Shows Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway, which can encourage Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Testing Commitment:** If Bob accepts this offer, it means he's serious about buying the product. If he rejects, it signals he's not willing to go much higher.
* **Maintains Leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm showing that I'm also willing to negotiate.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards a more acceptable price while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I have several rounds left, and selling to John guarantees me a significantly higher profit.

Here's why I'm choosing to reject and counteroffer:

* **Maximizing Profit:** I'm not yet desperate enough to accept a price that's still far below my target.
* **Remaining in Control:** By rejecting, I maintain the negotiating power and can continue to try and push for a better price.
* **Gathering Information:** Bob's increasing offers show his willingness to pay, which gives me valuable insight for my next counteroffer.

My next counteroffer will aim to bridge the gap between our current positions, potentially moving closer to $950,000 or even higher, depending on how strongly I believe Bob is willing to go higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $940,000, which is a small increase from my previous offer of $950,000. 

Here's why:

* **Showing Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and move closer to Bob's offer, signaling that I'm interested in closing the deal.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:** If Bob accepts this offer, it means he's willing to pay a price closer to my desired range. If he rejects, it signals he's not willing to go much higher.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm showing that I'm also willing to negotiate.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards a more acceptable price while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
