"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If you can't get a better price, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but also signals that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  We'll see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $135 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle. If not, I'm comfortable buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise but staying below Alice's price to keep some bargaining room. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a good compromise and accept."
