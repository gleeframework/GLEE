"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair price that acknowledges its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin the negotiation with a strong opening offer of $1,150,000.  This leaves room for negotiation but ensures we don't leave too much money on the table.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as ""fair,"" aiming to anchor Bob's perception around a higher number.
* **Alternative Option:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate to close a deal below our minimum.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how eager he is to acquire the product and how much bargaining power we have. 
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Ideally, we want Bob to accept this first offer or counter with something reasonably close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would mean a loss of $300,000 compared to selling to John. 

While we want to negotiate, accepting such a low offer in Round 2 would signal weakness and potentially lead to further lowball offers. It's more strategic to reject and counter, demonstrating our understanding of the product's value while still showing a willingness to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but your offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that acknowledges its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a significant concession by lowering our price by $100,000 from our initial offer. This shows Bob we are willing to negotiate and move towards a deal.
* **Holding Firm:** However, we are still holding firm above the midpoint between our initial offer and Bob's offer. This emphasizes that we are not desperate and believe in the product's value.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By ""meeting in the middle,"" we are implicitly inviting Bob to make a counter-offer closer to our price range. This keeps the negotiation moving forward.

We are aiming to strike a balance between securing a good deal and not pushing Bob away completely. By making a reasonable counter-offer, we hope to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved slightly closer to our price range, $950,000 is still significantly below our minimum of $1,200,000.  We need to demonstrate that we won't settle for a low offer.  Accepting at this point would likely lead to further lowballing in subsequent rounds. 

We are still in a strong position with John as a guaranteed buyer, so the risk of walking away from Bob's offer is lower. We will counter-offer, but remain firm to signal the true value of the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite a bit apart on price.  I've already made a significant move from my initial offer, and $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product will bring. To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,200,000.  However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I think that could be you. If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** We are taking a firmer stance in this round by stating our final offer. This conveys the seriousness of our position and the limited time Bob has to make a decision.
* **Transparency and Leverage:** We've introduced the existence of John and his offer, without explicitly saying we'll walk away.  This subtly leverages our alternative while remaining open to a deal with Bob.
* **Justified Concession:**  We are making a final concession of $50,000 but framing it as a significant move driven by our belief in Bob's potential fit. This makes the offer more appealing. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  The ""final offer"" tactic introduces a sense of urgency, prompting Bob to consider the deal more seriously and potentially counter with a substantial increase. 

This strategy aims to push Bob towards a decision. We are demonstrating our commitment to a fair deal but also our willingness to walk away if our terms aren't met."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not convinced that this product is worth $1,100,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. Here's why:

* **Stalled Progress:** Bob's offer of $975,000 shows he's not willing to significantly increase his valuation.  Even after we introduced our ""final offer"" and the presence of another buyer, his counter-offer is a mere $25,000 increase.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a high opportunity cost.  We risk losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John by chasing a deal that might never materialize at an acceptable price. 
* **Stronger Position:** We have a strong BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) with John. This gives us the leverage to walk away from Bob and still achieve our goal of selling at or above our minimum price.

While there's a slight chance Bob could come back with a much higher offer, it's not worth the risk of losing John's guaranteed purchase. It's time to prioritize certainty and secure the $1,200,000."
