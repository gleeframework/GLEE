"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair price that acknowledges its true worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but your offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that acknowledges its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite a bit apart on price.  I've already made a significant move from my initial offer, and $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product will bring. To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,200,000.  However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I think that could be you. If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. ",1100000.0,Alice,5,
