"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
