"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, leaving room for profit on your end.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. Let's close the deal at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $850,000 price. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",880000.0,Alice,5,
