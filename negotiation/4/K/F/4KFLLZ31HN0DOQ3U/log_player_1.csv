Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid losing a sale to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested, but still secures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a safety net.  Alice doesn't need to go below her minimum acceptable price."
