"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $100. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's still a great deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the product's value, I would like to offer $105. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer of $105 is closer to my desired price and is a better deal than selling to John for $80.  It's time to close the deal."
