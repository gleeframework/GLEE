"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and market conditions. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my price range. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the highest I'm willing to go.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to consider other options, so let me know if this is a deal-breaker for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
