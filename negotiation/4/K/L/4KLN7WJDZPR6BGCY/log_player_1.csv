Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is a strong offer that still leaves me with a significant gain. It's close enough to my minimum to deter excessive negotiation.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** I acknowledge that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. By positioning the price significantly higher, I'm setting the stage for a potential counter-offer while still staying within a reasonable range of his valuation. 

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I make a profit of $450,000, exceeding my minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:** I proceed with selling to John at my guaranteed price of $1,500,000."
