"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $950,000 is less than your maximum, it's still a significant amount. You can likely get a better deal.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Alice's message indicates she's open to negotiation. 
* **Jhon's offer is a fallback:** You have a backup option if negotiations with Alice fail.

By rejecting the offer, you open the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This would still allow you to make a significant profit while representing a better price point for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident that this product's true value warrants a higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While $900,000 is closer to your desired price point, it's still above your initial counteroffer.  This indicates there's room for further negotiation.
* **You have a backup:**  Jhon's offer gives you the security to continue negotiating without feeling pressured.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can counter again, potentially pushing the price even lower."

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 875000}
