"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll gain.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers, and settle on $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. While $1,125,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I need to be at least above $1,200,000 for this deal to make sense on my end.  Would you be willing to consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting close. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,150,000.  This is a fair offer considering the potential risks and rewards involved.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
