Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're reaching a point where the gains from continuing the negotiation are likely smaller than the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer to a point that would be significantly more attractive than John's offer.  It makes more sense to secure the guaranteed amount now."
