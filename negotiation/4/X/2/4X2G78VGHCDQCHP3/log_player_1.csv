Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $100, but leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, he has incentive to accept, but it's not an immediate ""yes"" either, giving room for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is your minimum, I'd rather try to get a better deal. Bob's offer is too low, so I will reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110, still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, hopefully leading to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 less than my last offer.  At this point, the negotiation is taking longer, and the risk of Bob walking away is increasing.  I'd rather sell to Bob now and avoid further risk."
