"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to make a deal, and I respect that. Would you consider coming down to $1,025,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm ready to commit if we can agree on this price.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,025,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're at a bit of an impasse.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. How about $1,037,500?  This shows I'm serious, but it's also a price I'm comfortable with.",1037500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate the increased offer. However, I'm still not ready to accept $1,037,500. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,080,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1080000.0,Alice,9,
