"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the door to getting a better price, even if it means potentially missing out on the deal with Alice."
