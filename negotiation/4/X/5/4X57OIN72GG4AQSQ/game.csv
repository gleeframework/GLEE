"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and I know you'll find it extremely valuable. Let's get this deal done!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Consider this: I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a significant discount for you, but it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1,300,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, at $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach an agreement. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get concerned that I might need to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy. If you're truly interested, this is our last chance to come to an agreement.  If not, I'll be moving on to other opportunities.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
