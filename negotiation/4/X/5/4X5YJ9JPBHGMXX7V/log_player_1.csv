Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

This offer is higher than John's offer of $120, which is my minimum price.  It is also lower than the value of the product to Bob ($150), making it a potentially appealing deal for him. This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential to earn a higher profit than I would from selling to John."
