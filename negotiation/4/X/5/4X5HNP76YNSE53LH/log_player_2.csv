I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  What do you think?

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.
