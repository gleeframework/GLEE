"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,000. Let's start with a price of $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,500.  This still gives you a good deal, considering what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $9,250.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
