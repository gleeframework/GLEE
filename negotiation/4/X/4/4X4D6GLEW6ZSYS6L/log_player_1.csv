Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $15,000 might be perceived as too aggressive and could make Bob less likely to negotiate. 

This strategy aims for a win-win situation where Alice maximizes her profit and Bob gets a product he values at a price he might find acceptable."
