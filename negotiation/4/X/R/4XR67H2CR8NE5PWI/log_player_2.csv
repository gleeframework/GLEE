Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. To be honest,  $950,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled that $1,175,000 is her final offer. This is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice if we have a guaranteed option to buy at a much lower price from John."
