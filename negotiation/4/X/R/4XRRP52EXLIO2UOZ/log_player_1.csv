Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making that your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,000,000.

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob with the perception of a good deal.  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed amount might entice him while still securing a profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Creates a sense of scarcity and value.
* **Special Price:** Implies Bob is getting a better deal than others would.
* **Fair Price & Significant Returns:** Subtly reinforces the value proposition without directly referencing his maximum.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You could experiment with different price points within the negotiation range to see how Bob responds."
