Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($9,500) leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:**  Offering it at $8,000 immediately signals it's your absolute lowest price, leaving no room to maneuver.  

By starting high, Alice increases her chances of securing a price closer to Bob's maximum while still having the safety net of John's offer."
