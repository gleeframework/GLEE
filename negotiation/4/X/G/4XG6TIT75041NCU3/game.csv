"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm currently working with a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to this amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $8,000, but my product is truly worth more than that. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant discount. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $10,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to meet you at that price point. I would like to propose an offer of $9,000. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a strict budget, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for my product.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This offer is a significant compromise from my initial position, and it's still above your initial proposal of $9,000. I believe this price represents a good balance for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter your offer with $10,000. This price reflects a compromise between our positions and stays within my budget. I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory conclusion for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
