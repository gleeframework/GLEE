"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
