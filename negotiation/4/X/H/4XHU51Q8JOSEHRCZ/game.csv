"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $5000 for this purchase. Would you be able to accommodate my budget?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're working with a budget, Bob, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $5000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $8000. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $6500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $6500 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $9000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your consideration, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget, I would like to propose a final offer of $7500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values.",7500.0,Bob,6,
