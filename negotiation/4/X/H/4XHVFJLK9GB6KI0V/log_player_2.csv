"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to go lower and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $70, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $75. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to get a good deal. It's likely Alice will counter with something in between $70 and $75, giving us room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $72, which is a good price for me.  I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice could reject my offer and we could end up with no deal.  $72 is a good compromise and saves me $8 compared to buying from John."
