"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to maneuver. I'll be prepared to lower the price if necessary, but I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay before making concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit from my initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to close the deal at any price.  I believe this is a fair counteroffer that might convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired value, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping I can get him to budge further. I believe I can still get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm continuing to be firm but also showing flexibility.  $1,050,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I believe Bob might be willing to meet me halfway at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $980,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for $1 million. I'm getting closer to my target price, and I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can reach my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

I'm making a small concession, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum desired value.  I believe this counteroffer shows my willingness to meet halfway, and hopefully will encourage Bob to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $990,000 is very close to my minimum desired value, with only two rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can push Bob further. To ensure I reach my target price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees me the best possible outcome, and I'm confident I made the right choice."
