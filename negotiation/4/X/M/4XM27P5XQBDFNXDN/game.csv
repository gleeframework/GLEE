"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
