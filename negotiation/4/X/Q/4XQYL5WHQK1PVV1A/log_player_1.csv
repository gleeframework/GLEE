{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180.  This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $160 is still above my minimum threshold of $150, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal in the short term.  I'm happy to accept and move on."
