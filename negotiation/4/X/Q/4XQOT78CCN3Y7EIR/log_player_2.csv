"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his budget, so offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This leaves room for potential compromises while still being within Bob's maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his ideal price.  Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can secure a lower price.  There are still rounds remaining, so there's time to try and reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal. By offering $8,750, he's showing willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. This is a reasonable increase from his previous offer, potentially enticing Alice to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,900 is the closest Alice has come to Bob's budget, it's still $900 above his ideal price. With several rounds still remaining, there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her offer further. Bob is within his budget, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small but significant increase from his previous offer. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his budget. The offer is within his financial limit and is a reasonable compromise to potentially close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come very close to Bob's budget.  While $8,850 is still more than Bob would ideally pay, it is only $850 over his maximum budget and the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  If Bob rejects this offer, it is likely Alice will not come down further, and Bob may be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
