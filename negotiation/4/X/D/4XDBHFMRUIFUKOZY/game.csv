"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This still represents a good value for you, and it's a significant reduction from my original price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. That's a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll find it acceptable. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
