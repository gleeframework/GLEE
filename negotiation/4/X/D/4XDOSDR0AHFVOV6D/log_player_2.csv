"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  While being firm, it's important to maintain a respectful and professional tone throughout the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're aiming to secure a price well below John's $1,500,000 backup option. This initial counteroffer sets the stage for potential compromises in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000. This still gives you a good deal, considering the value you'll get from it. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $1,325,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Negotiation:** Alice's counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate, so we continue the process.
* **Incremental Increases:**  We're gradually increasing our offer to show we're serious but staying firm below John's price.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  We're aiming for a price around the midpoint between our last offer and her counteroffer. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're aware of the 10-round limit, so we're applying pressure without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,325,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to continuing negotiations, but I don't want to waste too much time. Let's make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice is indicating some urgency, her latest offer is still $100,000 more than John's. We have room to negotiate further.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting now might signal we're willing to go higher, which could work against us.  We want Alice to believe this is a serious negotiation for us. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  We are getting closer to John's price, but with 5 rounds left, we have some buffer to potentially secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle this right now at $1,360,000? This offer represents a significant saving for me while still giving you a strong price for the product."",
""product_price"": 1360000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** By suggesting a ""right now"" decision, we're introducing a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Strategic Compromise:** This offer splits the difference between our previous offer and her current one. It shows a willingness to compromise but holds firm below John's price.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  We are emphasizing that this price is beneficial for both parties, aiming for a win-win outcome. 
* **Time Factor:**  We're getting closer to the 10-round limit, so we need to increase the pressure to close the deal favorably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm getting closer to where I need to be. However, $1,360,000 is still a bit too low. How about we settle on $1,380,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. Let's end this negotiation now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  Alice has moved significantly from her initial offer and is clearly motivated to close the deal.
* **Time Constraint:** We're running out of rounds, and continuing to negotiate aggressively risks pushing Alice away.
* **Favorable Price:**  $1,380,000 is a good deal. We're saving $120,000 compared to John's offer, and further haggling might only yield a small additional discount.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's a chance Alice could walk away if we push further, leaving us to accept John's offer at the last minute. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids that risk."
