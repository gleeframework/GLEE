Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $130. This is a price that is higher than Bob's value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives Bob a potential benefit, but also ensures I get a profit.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy is based on the following:

* **Negotiation:**  By offering a price lower than my minimum, I leave room for potential negotiation. If Bob counters with a lower offer, I can either accept or counter back.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me confidence to offer a lower price to Bob. This maximizes my chances of getting a higher price than John's offer."
