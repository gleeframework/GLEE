"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $20,000, which is $5,000 more than Bob's maximum price.  It's worth negotiating to see if Bob can get a better price.  There are also 9 more rounds to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $17,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Negotiation tactic:** By offering a lower price and highlighting the product's value to him, Bob is demonstrating his interest while pushing for a better deal.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $17,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $15,000, giving Alice room to counter without immediately hitting a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth a premium. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is ongoing:** There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving Bob time to see if he can get a better price.

```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $16,750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground on this."", ""product_price"": 16750}
```
