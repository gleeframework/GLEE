Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than his perceived value of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation if he rejects the offer. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price than his initial offer, it's still below what I would like to receive. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I want to see if I can push him further towards my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to Bob, as it's still higher than his perceived value but closer to his last offer.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 below my desired price and I'm confident that I can't get a better price from him.  While I would ideally like to get $15,000 from John, it's better to secure a sale now for $13,000 than to risk losing both Bob and John and ending up with nothing."
