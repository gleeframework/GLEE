Alice's offer:

This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a great value. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. It's in your best interest to buy from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
