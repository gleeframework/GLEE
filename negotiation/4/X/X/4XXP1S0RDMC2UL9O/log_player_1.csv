Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $100,000 if Bob accepts the $1,100,000 offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it allows room for negotiation. It also highlights the product's value and the benefit of exclusivity. 
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my desired price, ensuring no loss."
