"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $700000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $700000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum value for the product. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, $950000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $850000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Bob, but $850000 is still below my minimum value for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower. I think we've reached an impasse. I'm going to have to consider other options.",999999.0,Alice,7,
