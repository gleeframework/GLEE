Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 from John. 

Here's why:

* **Risk/Reward:**  Offering a higher price allows for a greater potential profit, but also carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Negotiation:**  By starting high, I leave room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Value Uncertainty:** I don't know Bob's value for the product, so a higher initial offer gives me the best chance of maximizing my earnings.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic decision with inherent risk. There's no guarantee Bob will accept the offer.  The success of this strategy will depend on how much Bob is willing to pay for the product."
