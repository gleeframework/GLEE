"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to start the negotiation. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $11,000 at this time.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Let's meet in the middle at $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $11,000, Alice.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm happy to offer $12,500, which is still a good deal for both of us and within my budget.  What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as high as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,500, which is $12,250. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. To be completely honest, I can't go higher than $12,000 at this point.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let's close this deal!",12000.0,Bob,6,
