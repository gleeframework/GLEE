Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as high as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,500, which is $12,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,250 is still slightly above my budget of $12,000. While it's tempting, I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get a lower price. I know John is willing to sell for $12,000, so I have that as a fallback option if I can't close a deal with Alice."

Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
