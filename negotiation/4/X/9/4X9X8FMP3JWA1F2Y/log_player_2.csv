"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, given the value it holds.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's much closer to her valuation than mine.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a much lower offer ($600,000) to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Respectful:**  Maintaining a good rapport with Alice is important. Even though I'm countering aggressively, I want to keep the conversation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is below my desired range, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me a decent return while giving you a significant discount. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but the price is still above my maximum budget. It's closer to my limit, so I know I'm getting closer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get it even closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's roughly halfway between my last offer and her latest counteroffer. This is a common negotiation tactic to show movement and find a compromise.
* **Justifying the Offer:** I'm framing it as a ""fair deal"" to appeal to a sense of fairness and reciprocity. 
* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While closer to my goal, this offer leaves some room for further negotiation if Alice isn't immediately receptive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still too low for me. Let's compromise at $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product while giving you a considerable discount. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing this price. It's time to accept and close the deal!"
