"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is below my desired range, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me a decent return while giving you a significant discount. Let's find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still too low for me. Let's compromise at $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product while giving you a considerable discount. It's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
