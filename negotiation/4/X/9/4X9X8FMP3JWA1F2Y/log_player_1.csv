"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, given the value it holds.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to a price that aligns with my minimum.  I'll use this round to send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is below my desired range, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me a decent return while giving you a significant discount. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired range. I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can get a better price. I'm willing to take the risk of another round of counteroffers to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still too low for me. Let's compromise at $800,000.
