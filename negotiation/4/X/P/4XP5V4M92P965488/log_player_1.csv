{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with the highest price:**  Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I'm starting with that price. This sets the tone for the negotiation.
* **Clear and concise message:** My message is brief,  explaining the offer and inviting Bob to respond. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I'm aiming for the full value, I understand that Bob might counteroffer. This initial offer sets a baseline for the negotiation.
* **The fallback option:** I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage to accept or reject counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is too low:**  While $500,000 is still a decent amount, it's significantly less than the product's worth to me.  I'm not willing to settle for half of what I know it's worth.
* **Opportunity for counter-negotiation:** Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-propose and potentially reach a more favorable agreement. 
* **The fallback option remains:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, giving me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need something closer to the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle at $750,000. This reflects both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a higher price:** I'm not willing to accept Bob's initial offer, but I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the product's value and emphasize that my counteroffer is fair.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:** I frame the offer as a way to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining flexibility:** By offering a compromise, I leave room for further negotiation if needed, while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $500,000 and $750,000, which would be $625,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $625,000 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me. I'm not yet willing to accept such a large discount.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, giving me the flexibility to push for a higher price.
* **Opportunity to counter-offer:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counter-offer and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $625,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit below the true value of the product.  Let's try $675,000. This offer is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs and allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 675000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:** I'm increasing the price by $50,000, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further, but not willing to drop significantly.
* **Framing it as a compromise:**  I emphasize that $675,000 is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Encouraging a deal:** I use language like ""finalize this deal"" to nudge Bob toward accepting the offer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I still have the option of selling to John, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $675,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** While $650,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's only $50,000 below my previous counter-offer. 
* **Bob's final offer:**  Bob has indicated that $650,000 is his highest offer, meaning further negotiation might not be fruitful.
* **The risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away entirely. It's likely that my next counter-offer will also be rejected, potentially leading me to sell to John for $1,000,000.  
* **A better outcome than selling to John:** Accepting this offer will secure me a profit of $650,000. While not my ideal scenario, it's a better outcome than selling to John for $1,000,000 and getting nothing more."
