"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to me. This product is not just an item; it's a testament to craftsmanship and innovation. Given its significance to me, I believe its worth exceeds what you've mentioned, reaching up to $1,500,000. However, understanding your perspective, I am willing to negotiate. My initial offer to you is $1,200,000, which I hope aligns with the product's value to you at $800,000. Should you decide to proceed, this would be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. It's better to reject the offer and purchase from John for a lower price."
