Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it's also a price that I'm comfortable with. If he rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes, and then decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm also showing flexibility to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $130.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $130 is a good deal.  It's more than I'd get from John, and the negotiation seems to be stalling.  I'd rather close the deal now than risk getting a lower offer or having Bob walk away."
