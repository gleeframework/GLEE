"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $11,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,000 is a bit steep for me though. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual budget. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Target Price:**  While your maximum budget is $8,000, aiming lower initially might lead to a more favorable outcome. 
* **Leaving Room:**  Offering $6,000 leaves room to negotiate upwards towards your $8,000 limit if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, which is a good sign. However, $9,000 is still above your budget and you have plenty of rounds left to negotiate. Let's see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $7,000. If you're able to meet me somewhere around there, I think we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** Now that we know Alice is willing to negotiate, it's time to start moving closer to your actual budget.
* **Honesty (To an Extent):**  While you don't want to reveal your absolute maximum, hinting that $7,000 is your realistic limit might encourage Alice to make a more appealing offer.
* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows that you are willing to compromise, but you still want a price that works for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it offers, and it brings us closer to an agreement.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is definitely getting closer to your budget, but you're now in a position to push for a price that's closer to John's offer. You're only $500 away from your ideal outcome, and still have several rounds left to negotiate.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower still."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate the compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250, and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 8250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  You're close enough to your budget that it's time to make a strong push for a price you're comfortable with.
* **Splitting the Difference (Again):** This maintains the spirit of compromise but keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to your target.
* **Clear Intent:** By saying ""we have a deal,"" you signal that this is your final offer, and you're ready to close if Alice agrees. 
* **John as Backup:** Remember, you always have the option of going with John for $8,000 if Alice doesn't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're so close to a deal!  I'm willing to meet you at $9,750.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's finalize this and make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It seems Alice is no longer negotiating in good faith. She increased her offer significantly from $8,500 to $9,750. This suggests she's not motivated to sell at a price you're comfortable with.  It's time to walk away and take advantage of John's offer of $8,000."
