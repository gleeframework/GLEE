"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, $11,500 is closer, but still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,750.  This is a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!",12750.0,Alice,5,
