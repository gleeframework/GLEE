{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $700,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit,  how about $850000?  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your constraints. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
