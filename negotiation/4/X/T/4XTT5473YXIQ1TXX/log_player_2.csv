"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose selling the product to you for $115. This price reflects its true worth while allowing us to reach a fair transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $115 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting this offer, you leave the door open for Alice to potentially come back with a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving as much money as possible."
