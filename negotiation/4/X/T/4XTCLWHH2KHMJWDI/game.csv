"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, however, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers a unique set of advantages, and I'm confident you'll see a substantial return on your investment.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the potential benefits and risks associated with the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $750,000 is simply too low. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to accept $950,000.  This is a significant concession on my part and reflects the true value this product brings.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. I understand the value proposition of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, finding a middle ground is important. I'm glad we're moving closer to an agreement.  To be completely transparent, $900,000 is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this price reflects the product's value while still offering you a strong return on your investment.",900000.0,Alice,7,
