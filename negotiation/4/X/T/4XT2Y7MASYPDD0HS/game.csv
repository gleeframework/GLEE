"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $900,000? This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $900,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $750,000 still doesn't work for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $850,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us. It's closer to your last offer and still allows me to get a fair price for my product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm getting close to my limit. I can do $800,000,  it's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
