"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value for Bob,  suggesting a ""fantastic deal"". 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open. This initial offer sets a high starting point, allowing me to potentially gain a better price, but also leaving room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000 and even below what I consider the product to be worth to me.
* **Negotiation room:** I still have 8 rounds to reach a more favorable price.  
* **John's offer:**  While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can potentially get more from Bob with further negotiations.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to keep the negotiation going. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob if it means potentially getting a better price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a more acceptable price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $900,000? This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a considerable step down from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential profit for Bob while reminding him that it's a fair price for both of us. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, leaving the door open for further discussion.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to meet halfway, showing flexibility but not compromising my minimum value.  I'm confident that $900,000 is a reasonable price that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $900,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation room:** We have six rounds remaining, and I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us.
* **John's offer:** While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I believe I can get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to potentially get a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $750,000 still doesn't work for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $850,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us. It's closer to your last offer and still allows me to get a fair price for my product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's last offer, but not compromising my minimum value.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing $850,000 as a ""good compromise"" for both of us.
* **Fair Price:** I'm reminding Bob that the offer is still fair, allowing him to make a profit while I get a price closer to my goal.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties.  I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to accept it. If he doesn't, I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I'm starting to get closer to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm getting close to my limit. I can do $800,000,  it's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** $800,000 is just below my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it's a significant improvement over his previous offers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk of losing the deal with Bob altogether. 
* **John's offer:** While John offers $1,000,000, I'm not guaranteed a sale with John, and I'm running out of rounds.

**Strategy:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's a good compromise that allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal completely.  I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price to ensure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
