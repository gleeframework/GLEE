Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a special price of $14,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still yields a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity. It's a substantial amount less than John's offer, potentially enticing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $14,500, there might be a small window for negotiation if Bob shows interest but hesitates at the price."
