Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but significantly less than your minimum.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving you a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below your minimum valuation. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,000? It's still a great price for you, and it's a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still not enough to justify the risk of further negotiation. It's more beneficial to sell to John and ensure a profit that meets your minimum valuation."
