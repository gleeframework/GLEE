"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $120. Would you consider lowering the price to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still unable to meet at $130. I would like to propose $125 as my maximum offer.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $125 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $127.50.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied.",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I would like to stick to my original offer of $125. This feels like a fair price given the value I expect to receive from the product.",125.0,Bob,6,
