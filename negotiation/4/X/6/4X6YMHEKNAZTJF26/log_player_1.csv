"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This price allows for a few rounds of negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $120. Would you consider lowering the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** While $120 is Bob's perceived value, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired $150. 
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides a strong incentive to continue negotiating with Bob, knowing I can always secure $150 if the deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:**  The counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair"" price and focuses on the mutual benefit of the deal.
* **Moving Closer to Target:**  $130 represents a significant step closer to my desired price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still unable to meet at $130. I would like to propose $125 as my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum, $125 is still below my acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's Offer is a Strong Incentive:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $150 from John gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without settling for a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $125 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $127.50.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 127.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to continue the negotiation and find a compromise.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  Offering $127.50 shows I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway again.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While this offer is closer to Bob's offer, it's still above my minimum price, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I would like to stick to my original offer of $125. This feels like a fair price given the value I expect to receive from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to budge from his $125 offer, and I'm unwilling to go below $150. 
* **John's Offer is Better:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will change his mind, and continuing the negotiation risks losing valuable time. 

By selling to John, I maximize my earnings and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
