"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",900000.0,Alice,1,
