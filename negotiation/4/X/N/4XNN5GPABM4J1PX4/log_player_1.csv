Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but I'm not quite ready to pay $175.  I'd be willing to pay $150 for it, which is what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm going to try and get a higher price than $150.  I'll counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $155, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $155 is a good compromise and getting a deal done is important."
