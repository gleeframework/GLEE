"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still looking to maximize my return on investment. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm offering the product for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're getting close to the wire, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much.
