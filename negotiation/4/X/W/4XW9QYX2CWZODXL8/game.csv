"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1300000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1350000?  This gives you a good price and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, but I can't go any lower. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
