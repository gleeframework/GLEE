Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,350,000?  This gives you a good price and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I need to push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but I can't go any lower. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1225000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I need to make a decision. While I'd like to get closer to my original goal, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made concessions, and it's unlikely he'll increase his offer significantly. Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum price, eliminating the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might not be fruitful."
