"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still gives me a decent profit.  This should encourage him to negotiate and hopefully we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $130. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $130 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product and the previous offers, I would like to suggest a price of $132. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $132 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum threshold and it's likely that Bob won't budge further. It's better to secure a sale now than to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer."
