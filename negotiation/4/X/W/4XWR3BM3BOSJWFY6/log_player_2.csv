{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can likely get a better price by negotiating. It's also worth noting that you have 10 rounds to negotiate, giving you ample time to find a more favorable deal.  Buying from John right away is not a good strategy as you can potentially save a lot of money by negotiating with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation while staying within your budget. The goal is to find a price that is fair to both parties and leads to a successful deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a genuine willingness to meet Alice halfway.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to your ideal price, and with only a few rounds left, it's a good time to secure the deal.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge further or you might run out of time. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of needing to buy from John at a much higher price."
