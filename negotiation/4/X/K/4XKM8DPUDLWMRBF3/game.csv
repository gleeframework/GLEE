"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $925,000. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $925,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings to the table is substantial. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is too low. How about we settle at $890,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",890000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, but I still think $890,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $845,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",845000.0,Bob,4,
