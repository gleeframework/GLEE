"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $140 is a good price for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a great product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if that works for you.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $155. It's still a great price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let me know if that works for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
