"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for $250 for it. Is this something you'd be interested in?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Can you meet me in the middle?",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob. However, $180 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $220?",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $220 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $200, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $200 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $210?",210.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $210. I'm willing to go up to $205, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",205.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $215?",215.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $215. I'm willing to go up to $200, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to think about buying from John at $150, so I'd appreciate it if you could meet me at $200",200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $210, Bob. I've already made several concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $210, but that's as low as I can go. Is that acceptable to you?",210.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear what my budget is, Alice. I'm not willing to go above $200. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and buy the product from John for $150. Thank you for your time, but I think I've reached my limit.",200.0,Bob,10,
