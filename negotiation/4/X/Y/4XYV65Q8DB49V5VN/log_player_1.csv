This offer is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from your minimum acceptable price, making it appealing to Bob. However, it's still a decent profit for you, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than your desired earnings. It's worth attempting to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between your previous offer and Bob's offer.  It's still a good price for you, while also showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough to make it worthwhile to continue the negotiation. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum desired price, which is the best option at this point."
