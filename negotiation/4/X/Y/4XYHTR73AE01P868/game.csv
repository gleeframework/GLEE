"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not convinced that $750,000 is a fair price for this product. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to you, and I hope we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $787,500.
