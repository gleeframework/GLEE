,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",14500.0,Alice,5,
