"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however,  $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000.  This price reflects the significant value and benefits you'll gain from this purchase.",900000.0,Alice,3,
