{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential worth to someone with your interests, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant value it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell it for a minimum of $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,300,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($700,000) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($200,000).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter. You can adjust your price slightly downward if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  Having John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. You don't have to go below your minimum price."
