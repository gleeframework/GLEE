"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a discounted price of $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's below what I would normally sell it for, and above what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
