"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows for room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential earnings, but I'm aware that I need to find a balance between maximizing profit and reaching an agreement before the 10 rounds are up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my ideal target. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm showing flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob hasn't budged from his previous offer. I'm going to keep rejecting his offer and see if I can push him higher.  There are still several rounds left and I don't want to settle for a price that's lower than I can potentially get."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,350,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to accept a price that's too low. I'm hoping that this will be enough to get Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally moved closer to my desired price.  While $1,250,000 isn't my ideal number, it's a significant improvement from his previous offers and with only 4 rounds remaining, I believe it's a good enough price.  I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
