Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know John acts as a price floor, guaranteeing Alice $1,200,000. Therefore, Alice should aim higher than $1,200,000 when negotiating with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) would likely result in an immediate rejection. Offering a price significantly above $1,000,000  leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still securing a price favorable to Alice.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the price."
