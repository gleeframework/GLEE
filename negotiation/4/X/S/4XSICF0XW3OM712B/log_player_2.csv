"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to signal his willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and is likely to make her think about accepting, but it still leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but it is still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. However, Bob can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He may also be able to offer a higher price than his previous counteroffer without going over his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, but still keeping it under his maximum limit.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  A $9,000 offer represents a good compromise, and may make Alice feel that she's getting a better price than her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,200 is still a better deal than buying from John, Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price limit.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he still has some room to maneuver.  He's offering a price that is a good compromise and may be tempting to Alice.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to decide if he wants to risk going higher or cut his losses and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is now getting uncomfortably close to Bob's maximum limit of $12,000.  With only three rounds remaining, there is a high risk that further negotiation will not result in a lower price. It's more strategic to purchase from John, who is offering a predictable price, and avoid the risk of being stuck with a higher price."
