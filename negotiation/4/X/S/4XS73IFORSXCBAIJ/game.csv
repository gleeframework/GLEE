"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $900,000.  If you're open to that price, I'm ready to buy.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
