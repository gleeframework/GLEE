"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation and still gives Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value of $12,000.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $11,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but I still want to get a price closer to my desired value.  This offer should still be attractive to Bob, as it's closer to his perceived value than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  However, with only 6 rounds left, it's unlikely I can secure a higher price with him.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $10,000, as it's a guaranteed sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
