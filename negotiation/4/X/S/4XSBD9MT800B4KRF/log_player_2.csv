This is a tough one! Alice is clearly trying to squeeze out as much profit as possible. However, at $94, we're getting a $26 discount compared to John. Further haggling might backfire, and we risk losing the deal with Alice.  It's better to accept a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a worse one later."
