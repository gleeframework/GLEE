"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that's worth at least $15000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details further. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. I can get the product for $12,000 from John, which is a better deal than Alice's offer of $18,000.
