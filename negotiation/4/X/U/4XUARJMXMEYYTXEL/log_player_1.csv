Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a starting point, and I believe it's a fair one. It's significantly higher than what I'd get from John, but leaves room for negotiation with Bob since it's below his perceived value. This strategy allows for the potential of getting closer to his valuation while still ensuring a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I will counteroffer, aiming to find a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This counteroffer still represents a significant profit for me and demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I believe this price remains attractive to Bob, considering his valuation of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Bob will continue to lowball me. Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
