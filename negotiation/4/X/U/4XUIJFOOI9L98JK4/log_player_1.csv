Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another offer. How about $10,800? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. There are only two rounds left and I don't want to settle for an offer that is too low."

Round 10
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  Bob's final offer is actually *higher* than his initial value, suggesting he might be playing games.  But, since we've reached the final round and he's already threatened to go with John, it's likely he's serious.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my goal of $12,000, selling to John for $10,000 is still a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer at $12,000, which is a huge loss for me."
