"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Can you consider a price closer to that?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500?  I think this price is fair given the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7200? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and the price I'm willing to pay.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm always happy to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $7800. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also accommodating your needs.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.",7800.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can agree to that.",7500.0,Bob,6,
