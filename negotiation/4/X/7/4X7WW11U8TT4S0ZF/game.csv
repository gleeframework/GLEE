"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I'm still aiming to keep the price at $10,000. This would allow me to fit the purchase into my current budget without straining it. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer the product for $11,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going any lower.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
