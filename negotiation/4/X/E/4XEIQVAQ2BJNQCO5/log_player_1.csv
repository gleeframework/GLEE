Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and the option of selling to John for my minimum price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This price still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $950,000? This price still reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a reasonable sacrifice to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still too low for me. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate and the option of selling to John for my minimum price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still too far from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product and the fact that it's still well within my minimum acceptable price.  Let's close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
