"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential gains. I'm also being friendly and positive to create a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming to get a profit. I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $130. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, and with only 6 rounds left, it's better to secure the deal than risk losing him and having to sell to John at a lower profit."
