"Alice, $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,750?  That leaves us both with some room to compromise and hopefully we can seal the deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,750 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
