You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $12,000 which is still a good deal for you.  It's better to accept her offer than to risk her rejecting your counteroffer again or going to John and paying $10,000."
