"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $90 for it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate if needed, but also shows that I'm confident in the product's value.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't give up the product for a price that undervalues it. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to drop that low. How about we split the difference?  I'd be happy to sell for $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with $85, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding onto a value closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $75 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price.  I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement in the next round.  However, I'm also aware that I could sell to John for $80 at any point. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $80 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but I can't go lower than $80. This product is truly worth it, and $80 is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with my minimum price, $80. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's also the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price for both of us. If he doesn't, I'm still prepared to sell to John for the same price."
