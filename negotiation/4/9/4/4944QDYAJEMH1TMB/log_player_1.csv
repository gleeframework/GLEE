Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. This subtly reminds him of the $15,000 value he places on it, potentially making him more willing to negotiate.
* **Open-ended:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for his thoughts. This encourages him to counteroffer if he's not satisfied with the initial price.

This approach balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects, I can always counteroffer or move on to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John for $8,000, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $12,000. Bob clearly values the product at $15,000, so there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $10,500?  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin based on the value you place on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing profit:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential profit he can still make by buying the product at my price, even though it's higher than his offer.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts, keeping the negotiation open for further discussion. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping the negotiation alive, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial target of $12,000, continuing the negotiation risks losing the sale altogether. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I earn a decent profit while minimizing the risk of ending up with nothing. It's a good compromise that allows me to move forward with the sale."
