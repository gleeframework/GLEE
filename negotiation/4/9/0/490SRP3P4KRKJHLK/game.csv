"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to come down to $150.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $135?  That's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $135 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $142.50? I'm willing to come down a bit more, but that's my final offer.",142.5,Alice,5,
