This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm not giving away the product for cheap. I'll analyze Bob's response to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to test the waters."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference with Bob. I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000 to him, so I'm going to offer him $18,000 as a compromise. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $16,000, which is better than my guaranteed $15,000 from John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  It's better to secure a sale at $16,000 than to risk getting nothing from Bob and then having to settle for John's offer."
