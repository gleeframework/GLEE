"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It falls well below my minimum threshold for selling this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still allows for a significant profit margin for you while remaining fair to me. Let's find a common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $825,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
