Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is incredibly valuable to me. I'm offering it to you at a price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that allows for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **The message:** This is friendly and open to negotiation. It emphasizes the value of the product without being aggressive. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Initiate negotiations:** Starting with a higher price allows for room to negotiate down, potentially getting closer to my desired $15,000. 
* **Maintain flexibility:** This offer leaves room for counteroffers without immediately resorting to John's offer.
* **Build rapport:** A friendly approach helps foster a positive relationship with Bob, potentially leading to a more successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at such a significant loss.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows for a counteroffer, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired $15,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John right now would secure $15,000, but rejecting Bob's offer keeps open the possibility of a better deal with him, or even a higher counteroffer from John if he hears about my negotiation with Bob.
* **Assessing Bob's commitment:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, which is promising. A counteroffer allows me to gauge his willingness to pay a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still allows for a healthy profit for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This price is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). 
* **Message:** I emphasize the compromise and reiterate the value of the product, subtly highlighting the benefit for Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying in the game:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate. It keeps the negotiation alive and increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer helps gauge Bob's flexibility and potential to reach a higher price point.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer, I still have the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
