"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is incredibly valuable to me. I'm offering it to you at a price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting, Bob can start negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still allows for a healthy profit for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still higher than Bob's budget, and he doesn't want to risk further negotiation leading to an even higher price. John offers the best deal at this point."
