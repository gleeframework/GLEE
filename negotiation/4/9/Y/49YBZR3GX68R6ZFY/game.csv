"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it. This price allows me to achieve my target while still leaving you with a substantial profit.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
