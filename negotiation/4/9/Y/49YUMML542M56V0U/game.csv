"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I truly believe this product is worth it to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,300,000 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000.  This price is still within my acceptable range, and I hope it's fair for you as well.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
