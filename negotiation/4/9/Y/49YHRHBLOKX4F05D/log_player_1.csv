Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation, but significantly lower than my minimum. This allows for potential negotiation and gives Bob a good reason to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $950,000, so I'm offering $825,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's not clear if I can get him to budge further.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
