"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This product has features and benefits that justify the price and will bring you significant value.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best value, and I'm trying to be fair. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000 even. This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I can go and still make this deal worthwhile.",12000.0,Alice,5,
