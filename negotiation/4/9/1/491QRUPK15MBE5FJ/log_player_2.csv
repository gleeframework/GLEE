"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you have a fallback option with John.  You can try to get a better price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than you initially quoted, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. You've already demonstrated your willingness to compromise, and you can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping for a better deal though. How about $850,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $875000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you've already successfully negotiated a price lower than your initial goal.  While you could continue trying to negotiate a lower price, there's a chance Alice won't budge further. Accepting her offer saves you $325,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise and a smart move to secure the product at a favorable price."
