Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price for this product, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.

At this point, Alice's offer matches John's price. There's no benefit to further negotiation or going with John.  It's best to accept the offer and get the product."
