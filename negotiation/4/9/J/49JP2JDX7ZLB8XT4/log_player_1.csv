Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and open to negotiation to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make an offer of $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I've researched and the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with him. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This is a final offer that's fair to both of us. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to go with another buyer who's willing to pay that price. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer of $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go higher than $920,000, which is still below my minimum.  To ensure I get my desired price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
