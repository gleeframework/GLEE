"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make an offer of $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I've researched and the price I'm willing to pay.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This is a final offer that's fair to both of us. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to go with another buyer who's willing to pay that price. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer of $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",920000.0,Bob,6,
