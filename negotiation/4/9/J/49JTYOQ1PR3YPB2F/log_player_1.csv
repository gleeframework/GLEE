Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm aiming for a higher price and believe I can get closer to my desired amount. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $950,000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I'm trying to make a deal, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $925,000 is a good deal considering my minimum is $800,000. It's also a strong possibility that Bob won't budge further.  Accepting his offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of him backing out or me having to settle for John's lower offer."
