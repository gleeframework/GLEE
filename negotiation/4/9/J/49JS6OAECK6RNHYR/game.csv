"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within a reasonable range for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise at $820,000. I believe this is the best price we can agree on, considering the value of the product and my initial offer.",820000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, you've been very accommodating, but $820,000 is still pushing my budget. My final offer is $800,000. If you can't agree to that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,,
