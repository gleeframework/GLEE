"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a good deal while allowing me to recover a decent portion of my value. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $1,275,000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to come down more.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,275,000 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down slightly further, to $1,325,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering our respective valuations. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable solution.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,312,500. This is a very small adjustment, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1312500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, we're getting very close. I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm offering $1,303,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize this deal.  If you're not interested, I'm going to have to move on to other offers.",1303750.0,Alice,9,
