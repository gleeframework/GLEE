"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1000000. I would like to propose an alternative price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I'm eager to sell the product to you, $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975000.  This compromise allows me to meet my financial needs and gives you a significant discount from my initial price. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,3,
