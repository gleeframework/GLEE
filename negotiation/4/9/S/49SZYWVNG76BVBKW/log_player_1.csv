"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is above my minimum ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there is a potential for a win-win situation.
* **Friendly tone:** Keeping the message positive and friendly can help build rapport and encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** Bob is willing to pay $12,000, which is still above my minimum of $10,000.  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and show that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only 10 rounds, I want to use each one strategically to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price still reflects the significant value this product brings, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows good faith. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, even while offering a lower price, to keep him motivated.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive to encourage a smooth negotiation."
