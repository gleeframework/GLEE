"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's lower than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's limit.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

Bob is offering $8,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer and is closer to Bob's maximum price. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum price. While it's possible to continue negotiating, Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price, and the risk of not getting the product is too high."
