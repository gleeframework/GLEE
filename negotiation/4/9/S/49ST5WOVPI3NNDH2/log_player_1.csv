Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer sets a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, giving Bob a potential incentive to buy.  However, it's still below an unrealistic price that would make Bob immediately reject the offer. By offering a higher price, you increase your chance of maximizing your earnings while still securing a sale in case Bob declines."
