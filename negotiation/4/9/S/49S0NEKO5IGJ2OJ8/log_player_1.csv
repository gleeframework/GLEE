Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I value the product at $1,000,000, so I won't sell for less.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so he won't pay more.
* **Negotiation space:** There's a $200,000 gap between our values.  
* **First offer strategy:**  I'm starting with a high offer, but still within the negotiation space. This leaves room for potential counteroffers while still maximizing my potential profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:** I'll analyze Bob's response and decide on my next move: 
    * **Accept:** If he accepts, I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
    * **Counteroffer:** If he counters, I'll evaluate his offer against my minimum value and John's offer. If it's acceptable, I'll consider accepting; if not, I'll counter again or go with John.
    * **Reject:**  If Bob rejects outright, I'll likely go with John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** While closer to my initial offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer:** John is offering my minimum value and provides a guaranteed sale.
* **Negotiation risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he might not be willing to move higher, leaving me with nothing but a wasted negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

The potential gain from negotiating further is too small compared to the certainty of John's offer. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and going with John to ensure I get my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I still value the product at $1,000,000, but I'm willing to slightly lower my expectation to keep the negotiation going.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob offered $920,000, which is closer to my desired price. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's but still below my initial asking price. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining a strong position.

**Next steps:**

* **Bob's response:** I'll analyze Bob's response and decide on my next move:
    * **Accept:** If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
    * **Counteroffer:** If Bob counters again, I'll consider his offer and either accept or make a new counteroffer based on his offer.
    * **Reject:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $1,000,000. The potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is shrinking, and John offers a guaranteed sale."
