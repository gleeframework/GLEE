"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I know you'd value greatly. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have an alternative with John at $12,000. There's a good chance you can get Alice to come down in price, saving you even more money."
