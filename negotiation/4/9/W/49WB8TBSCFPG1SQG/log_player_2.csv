"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my target price of $800,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to push for a lower price. I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

It's a higher price, but it guarantees I get the product without further negotiation and risk of losing the deal."
