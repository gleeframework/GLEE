Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80):** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price ($120):** This gives you a buffer and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It quickly gets to the point and leaves room for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $120. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $90. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my desired price and is within my acceptable range. It's worth accepting this offer as it's only $10 less than what John would pay. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob and having to settle for John's price, which is lower than what I initially aimed for."
