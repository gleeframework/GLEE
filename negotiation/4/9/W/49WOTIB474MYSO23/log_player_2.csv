Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal, he can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and respect your budget. To bridge the gap, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This offers a midpoint between our previous offers, providing value to both parties. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still looking to save as much as possible, and $1,100,000 is still too high. He can likely get closer to his target price with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions. I hope this suggestion is acceptable and moves us closer to reaching an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he was hoping for $1,050,000, Alice has come down to $1,075,000.  This is a good deal for Bob, as it saves him $425,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might save him a little more, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that Bob will end up paying more if Alice counteroffers at a higher price."
