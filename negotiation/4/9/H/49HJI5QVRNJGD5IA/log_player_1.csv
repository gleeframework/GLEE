"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to entice Bob.  I've set the price slightly above his perceived value, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. How about $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my product's value.  I'll counteroffer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 8000}
