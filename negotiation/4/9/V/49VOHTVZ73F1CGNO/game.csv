"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider my other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, but that's my absolute final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
