"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business and the competitive advantage it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  There's potential to get a better price, so rejecting the offer and counteroffering makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This product is definitely valuable, but I need to stay within a tight budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to my target?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target price of $1,000,000. It's still above my ideal, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.  I can save $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting her offer is the most financially prudent option."
