"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business and the competitive advantage it provides. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This product is definitely valuable, but I need to stay within a tight budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to my target?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
