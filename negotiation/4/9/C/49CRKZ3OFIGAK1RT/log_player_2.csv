"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $115. This is a fantastic deal, as it's worth more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $115. 
* While this is a better deal than buying from John, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or potentially find another seller offering a better deal."
