Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  While you value the product at $150 minimum, starting high allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate or accept your initial offer.
* **Strategic pricing:** $145 is a price point that's slightly below your minimum but still significantly more than Bob's perceived value. It might entice him while still securing a profit for you. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $145. If he rejects the offer, you still have the safety net of selling to John for $150."
