"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start with my minimum acceptable price, $1,200,000.  This gives Bob a clear understanding of my value for the product and sets a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drop my price by $300,000 in one round. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,100,000.  This shows Bob that I'm open to negotiation, but it still keeps the price significantly closer to my minimum value.  I believe this price is reasonable and gives Bob a chance to make a deal without going too far below his own value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offer is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's current offer. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to sell the product for anything less than my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. However, with only 4 rounds remaining, I don't have time to risk further negotiation. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $1,200,000, which is a better outcome for me. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John."
