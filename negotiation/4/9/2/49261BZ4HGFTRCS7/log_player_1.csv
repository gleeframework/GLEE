Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but I believe it's important to establish a high value for the product from the start.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I believe I can push for a better deal by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $920,000 is still a good deal and significantly higher than selling to John. It's important to consider the potential for further negotiation with Bob versus the risk of losing him entirely."
