"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and would greatly benefit your business.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it would bring to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $925,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you and the value it would bring to your business. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
