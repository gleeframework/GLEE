Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
