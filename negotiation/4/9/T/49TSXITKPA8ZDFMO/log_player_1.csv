Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will give me a sense of Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** The fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $800,000 gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'm not in a desperate situation. I can always fall back on John.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully observe Bob's response. If he accepts, fantastic! 
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine my next move. I'll consider factors like:
    * How much lower is his counteroffer?
    * How confident am I that I can get a better price?
    * How much time am I willing to spend negotiating?

**The goal is to maximize my profit, but also to be aware of the potential risks of losing the deal altogether.**"
