Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than you think. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe the product is worth more. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round.  There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a lower price too early."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $880,000 is still below what I need to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $915,000? This price is a fair compromise that takes both of our perspectives into consideration. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 915000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal. We're nearing the end of our rounds, but I think there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I want to see if I can push a bit further before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time here.  $890,000 isn't quite meeting my needs.  I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000, but this is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other options.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're down to the wire and Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd love to get a higher price,  I'm concerned that we won't reach an agreement with Bob in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than risking getting stuck with a lower price or no deal at all."
