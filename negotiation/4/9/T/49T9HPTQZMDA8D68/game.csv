"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This price would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a fair return on your investment. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering I value the product at $1,200,000. I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know your thoughts on this offer.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'm willing to meet you at $1,087,500. This is a compromise that still allows me to get a good return on my investment while being reasonable considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
