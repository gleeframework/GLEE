"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still provides a good margin for both of us. This price allows for a win-win situation and ensures you can leverage the product's potential to its fullest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price represents a fair value for both of us, allowing you to get a good return and me to acquire a valuable asset. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 still doesn't fully capture the value this product offers. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This price reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal and unlock the product's potential together.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer and reflects a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  Let's work together to finalize this deal and unlock the potential of this product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  $975,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this valuable asset. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
