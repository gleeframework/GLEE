"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, but it allows for negotiation and potentially allows me to capture more value. I'm hoping Bob will counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum.  I will then assess his counteroffer and make a decision based on his financial situation and the potential of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired value. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my initial offer. I hope this shows good faith and encourages him to continue negotiating.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a deal falling apart outweighs the potential of getting a slightly higher price. It's important to balance risk and reward in negotiations, and in this case, accepting the offer seems like the best move."
