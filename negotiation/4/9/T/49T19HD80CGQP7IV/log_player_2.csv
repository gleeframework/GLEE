Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $120 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $180. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
