Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it's still less than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $115. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still closer to my desired price than his offer. I believe this is a good middle ground that will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still higher than selling to John and closer to my initial asking price.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal completely."
