Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since John offers $1,000,000, starting close to that figure is strategic.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling closer to $900,000.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and seriously consider the offer.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
