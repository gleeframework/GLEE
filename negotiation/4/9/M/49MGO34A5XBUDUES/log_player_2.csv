"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. This product has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your needs and exceed your expectations. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth $15,000 to you. However, I understand that everyone appreciates a good deal, so I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I hope this price aligns with your budget and allows us to bring this valuable asset into your possession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **You have a better option:**  You can get the product from John for $15,000, which is within your budget.

Since rejecting Alice's offer leads to a better outcome for you (buying from John within your budget), you should reject."
