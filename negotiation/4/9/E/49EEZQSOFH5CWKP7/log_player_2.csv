Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I can do $720,000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:** 

At $720,000, Alice's offer is now a good deal. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and we risk Alice becoming firmer in her position. Accepting now guarantees a significant savings compared to John's offer of $800,000."
