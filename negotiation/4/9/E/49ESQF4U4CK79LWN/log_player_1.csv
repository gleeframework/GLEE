Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering the product at $10,000 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum, creating a potentially agreeable deal for both parties. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's attractive enough for him to accept."
