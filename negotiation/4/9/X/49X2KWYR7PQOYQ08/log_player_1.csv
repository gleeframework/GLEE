Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to earn above your minimum.

**Strategic Pricing**

You need to strike a balance:

* **Too High:**  If you get greedy and ask for close to $1,200,000, Bob might reject it, knowing he can find similar deals elsewhere.
* **Too Low:** Offering a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This represents a fair deal considering its unique benefits and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message positions the offer as valuable and exclusive.
* **Price Justification:**  While not revealing your bottom line, the phrase ""fair deal"" subtly implies you've factored in its worth.
* **Strategic Price Point:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, which is a strong incentive to accept. It also secures you a $150,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is nuanced. Bob's personality, your relationship with him, and external market factors could all influence the outcome. However, this offer provides a strong starting point to maximize your potential earnings."
