Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium. 

If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own. If the negotiation drags on, I always have the option to sell to John for my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum value. Since I can sell to John for $1,500,000, that's the best option for me at this point."
