Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $16,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its quality and potential."", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how serious Bob is about the product and how far he might be willing to go.
* **Leave Space for Concessions:**  A high initial offer allows you to make concessions during the negotiation, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still keeping the negotiation open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further. 

By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a price closer to your valuation, and it opens the door for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $10,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving down from $16,000 to $13,000, you demonstrate willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation while aiming for a price closer to your target.
* **Clear Justification:**  Framing the counteroffer as ""meeting halfway"" provides a simple and seemingly fair rationale for the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel we can find a middle ground. Could we agree on $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below your absolute minimum of $12,000. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and continuing the negotiation might not yield a significantly better offer. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, which meets your minimum acceptable price. 

It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure a sure sale with John."
