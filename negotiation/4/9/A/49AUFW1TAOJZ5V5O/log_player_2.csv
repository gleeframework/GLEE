"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $8,000 is a good deal, it's still more than you're willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, so you'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $8,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $7,000.  I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I need to make sure the price is right for me."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,500, which is a good price for you. While you might be able to squeeze out a little more, the risk of losing the deal to John or continuing negotiations for too long outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting this offer is the most strategic choice."
