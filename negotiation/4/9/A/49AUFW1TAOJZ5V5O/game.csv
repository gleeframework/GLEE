"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $8,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $7,000.  I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I need to make sure the price is right for me.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
