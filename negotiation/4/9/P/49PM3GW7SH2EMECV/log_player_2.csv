"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $110 is lower than her product's worth to her, you can get a better deal from John for $100. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to proceed with buying from John."
