Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really enjoy it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** It allows you to potentially make a profit and still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's a friendly and engaging message:** This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially accept the offer.

Let me know if you want to adjust the offer or the message, and we can continue the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to your minimum, you can likely do better. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. How about we split the difference?  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **It shows flexibility:** You're willing to negotiate, but not at a price that's too low.
* **It's still above Bob's offer:** This keeps the pressure on Bob and incentivizes him to accept.
* **It's a positive message:** You express your desire to close the deal and create a sense of urgency.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you at $92. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's wise to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **You're getting closer to your minimum:** $92 is only $8 away from your minimum of $120.
* **Further negotiation might not be fruitful:** Bob is clearly firm on his offer and further negotiation might just waste time.
* **Selling to John is a safer bet:**  While you'd get more money by selling to John, you're also taking a risk that Bob might accept a counteroffer in a later round.

Accepting Bob's offer is a pragmatic choice that ensures you get a decent price and avoids further negotiation."
