"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. It also establishes a strong starting point and signals my confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,700,000.  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price that is closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping that this move will convince Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target.  While I'd prefer to push for $1,700,000, there's a risk of him walking away entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, especially considering the risk of John not being available later."
