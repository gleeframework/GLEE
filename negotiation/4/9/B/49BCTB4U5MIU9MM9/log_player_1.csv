Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to what I know the product is worth to Bob, but leaving some room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a good deal and not pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $130 is within my acceptable range and significantly better than selling to John for $100.  It's time to secure the deal."
