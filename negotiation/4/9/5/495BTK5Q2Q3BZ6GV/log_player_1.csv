"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's estimated value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the deal.
* **Open-Ended:** My message invites Bob to respond and gives him the opportunity to counteroffer. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware that John is a backup option at $1,500,000, so I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value but still leaves room for some compromise with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. That's my top price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. While I'm not going to accept this offer, I'm not willing to sell to John yet.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** I'll use the next round to counter with a price that's closer to my target while acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,300,000? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm proposing a price halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that $1,300,000 is still a good deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not dropping the price too drastically, ensuring I still have some negotiating room if Bob rejects this offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I'm only on round 4, and there's still room for negotiation. It's not the time to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirements.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target while acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a price that reflects the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not drastically. It shows I'm serious about making a deal, but I still have leverage.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a significant compromise from my side to encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get, making him realize this is still a good deal for him.
* **Open-Ended:**  The message leaves space for Bob to counteroffer if he's not satisfied, keeping the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1280000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,280,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Stalled:**  We're not making significant progress. Bob is stuck at his price, and I'm still holding out for a higher value.
* **Risk of Time:**  We're on round 6, and I'm concerned about running out of time. Selling to John at $1,500,000 might be the more secure option at this point.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target while acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise, but I'll be prepared to sell to John if this doesn't work."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be at least at $1,320,000 to make this deal work for me. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product to you. It's time to finalize this transaction. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1320000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure to Close:** This is a firm but polite attempt to push Bob towards a deal. I'm using phrases like ""getting close"" and ""finalize"" to create a sense of urgency.
* **Final Compromise:** This offer is closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum. It shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not backing down further.
* **Highlighting Value Again:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob to remind him of the benefit he'll get.
* **Balancing Risk:** I'm taking a calculated risk.  If Bob rejects, I'll likely go to John in the next round. However, I'm hoping this offer is persuasive enough for Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1320000. I'm willing to meet you at $1290000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're on round 8, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm concerned about running out of time. 
* **No Significant Progress:** Bob's offer of $1,290,000 is only slightly higher than his previous offer. There's a risk that we'll be stuck in this range until the end of the negotiation.
* **Securing a Better Outcome:** John is offering a significantly higher price of $1,500,000, which aligns with my minimum requirement. 
* **Avoiding Potential Loss:** There's a chance that Bob might reject my counteroffer in the next round, and I might have to settle for an even lower price.

**Conclusion:** Selling to John guarantees a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob, as there's no guarantee that I can reach a satisfactory price with him within the remaining rounds."
