"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  While the product is worth $12,000 to him, he doesn't need to pay full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $9,000 is a good price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer to pay less, $9,500 is still a good deal for him.  It saves him $2,500 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk that if he rejects the offer, Alice will be unwilling to go lower and he'll end up paying more or having to buy from John."
