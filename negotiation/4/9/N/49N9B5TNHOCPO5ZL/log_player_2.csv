"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $115. This is slightly above the base cost but still offers a good deal compared to its worth to you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is less than what John is selling for, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You have room to lower the price as you value the product at $120 and Alice values it at $100."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $105 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your offer. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to accept $105 for the product. My current offer stands at $115. I am confident that this price reflects the value of the product to both of us. Please let me know if there's any room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to her initial offer of $115, but we know she values the product at $100.  There's still room for negotiation, especially as I'm willing to pay $120 from John.  Rejecting her offer will keep the pressure on her and potentially lead to a lower price in the next round."
