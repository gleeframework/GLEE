"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $115. This is slightly above the base cost but still offers a good deal compared to its worth to you. Let me know if this works for you!",115.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $105 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your offer. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to accept $105 for the product. My current offer stands at $115. I am confident that this price reflects the value of the product to both of us. Please let me know if there's any room for negotiation.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and value your product, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $110 for it, which would be a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",110.0,Bob,4,
