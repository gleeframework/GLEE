"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This product is truly worth the investment, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still pretty far apart. $16,000 is more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $11,000? That's a significant move on my part.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $14,000? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I need to see some more movement to make this work.  How about $12,000?  That splits the difference between our last two offers.",12000.0,Bob,6,
