"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. I think it's a great value for what it offers, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,500 right now.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $13,500. If we can meet in the middle, I'm happy to proceed.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $14,750? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",14750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,750 is still a bit higher than what I can afford at the moment.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a bit more than $14,000. How about we meet at $14,250? It's a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",14250.0,Alice,7,
