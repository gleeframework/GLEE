"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. For this exceptional opportunity, I propose a price of $150. I'm confident it's a fair deal considering the quality and value it offers.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to consider your offer. However, due to the costs associated with production and maintaining high-quality standards, I cannot accept $125. My counteroffer would be $135. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still compensating us fairly for the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have costs to consider, but $135 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $120. Would you be willing to consider this price?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After carefully considering your offer, I've decided to counter with a price of $125. This reflects a compromise that takes into account both the value of the product and your budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to being satisfied with the price, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to meet you at $115. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",115.0,Bob,6,
