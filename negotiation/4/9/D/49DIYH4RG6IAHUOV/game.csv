"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?  ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's meet in the middle, and see if we can close this deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer.  How about we settle for $90? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product worth it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $89.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",89.0,Bob,6,
