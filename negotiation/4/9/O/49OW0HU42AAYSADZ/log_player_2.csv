"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to get the best deal possible. This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a range that might be acceptable to Alice considering she values the product at $1,200,000.  It's a strong starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the best deal possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his target price of $1,000,000, he can likely still get it lower.  He can try another counteroffer to see if he can push Alice further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is Bob's final attempt to get the price down to his target of $1,000,000.  It's a significant improvement over his previous offer, and Alice is likely motivated to close the deal, especially if she doesn't want to risk losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's goal was to get the product for $1,000,000, Alice's final offer of $1,025,000 is very close to his target price. It's a good deal for Bob, and further negotiation might be time-consuming and not necessarily lead to a better price.  The risk of losing the product to John, especially with Alice's counteroffer being so close, is too high."
