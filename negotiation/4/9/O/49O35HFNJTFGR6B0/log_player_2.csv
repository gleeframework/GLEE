# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $1,100,000. It's a unique chance to acquire a valuable item that's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and also less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
