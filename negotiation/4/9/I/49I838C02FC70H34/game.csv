"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000.  Would you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This product is truly unique and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product is quite high.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's the lowest I can go.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $15,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. I could stretch my budget to $11,000, but that's really the most I can offer.  It's a fair offer considering it's a good bit above what I could get it for elsewhere.",11000.0,Bob,6,
