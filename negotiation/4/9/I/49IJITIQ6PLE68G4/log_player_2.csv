"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, now's the time to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Bob has a few rounds left and can try to negotiate further.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go to $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck on price, but I'm still interested in selling to you. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal, but $13,500 is still outside of his budget. With a few rounds remaining, Bob can continue trying to push Alice lower, aiming for a price closer to his $12,000 limit. There's still potential for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit above where I can go right now.  I'm willing to go to $13,000, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
