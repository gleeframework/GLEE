"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for a price that's only $1 more than your maximum budget.  There's no real benefit to negotiating further, as any counteroffer you make could potentially lead to a higher price, and you're risking the chance of Alice rejecting your counteroffer. Accepting her offer is the most financially responsible choice in this situation."
