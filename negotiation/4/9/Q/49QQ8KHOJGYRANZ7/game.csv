"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $90 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to do $70? That would work much better for my budget.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we try to find a sweet spot at $85? It's a fair price that still gives me a decent profit.",85.0,Alice,5,
