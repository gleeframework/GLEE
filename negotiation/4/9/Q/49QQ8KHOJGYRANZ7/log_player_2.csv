"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. The goal is to see how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still more than we want to spend. Let's try negotiating a bit more, but we should be prepared to walk away and buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $90 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to do $70? That would work much better for my budget."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We are moving closer to our ideal price.  This counteroffer shows Alice we are willing to negotiate, but also sets a firm boundary. We are getting close to the point where buying from John might be the better option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we try to find a sweet spot at $85? It's a fair price that still gives me a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we're very close to our limit. Buying from John at $80 guarantees we stay within budget and don't risk further negotiation."
