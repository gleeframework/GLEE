Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John), I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  
* **Potential for higher profit:** Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. Even if he counter-offers, I'm likely to get a price higher than my minimum. 
* **Confidence:**  Presenting a strong initial offer can sometimes signal the product's value and make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is slightly risky. If Bob is turned off by the high price and doesn't counter-offer, I'll miss out on the extra profit.
* It's crucial to gauge Bob's interest level and adjust my approach in subsequent messages if needed."
