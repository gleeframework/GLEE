"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a decent price, you know you have a backup option at $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or at least see if she's willing to come down closer to her own product valuation."
