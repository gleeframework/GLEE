"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  While the product is interesting, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know if you'd be interested in working with that figure.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than $850,000 based on my assessment. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,025,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value I place on the product and my current budget, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. I'm willing to make one final concession at $980,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go considering the product's potential.  If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're at your limit, but $980,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm ready to make a final offer of $960,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",960000.0,Bob,6,
