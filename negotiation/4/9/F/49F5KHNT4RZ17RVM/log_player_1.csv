Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest!  I can come down a little bit from my initial price. How about $125? That's still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $125. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $115 is still too low for me. I'm going to try and see if I can get a higher price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $120 for the product, which is my absolute bottom line. This is a great deal for a product that you'll definitely enjoy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
