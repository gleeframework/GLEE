"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! Splitting the difference was a good idea. However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $975,000, which would be $1,012,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is a price you're comfortable with!",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're a tough negotiator!  I'm willing to come up a little bit, but $1,012,500 is still too high for me. How about $990,000? ",990000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to come up, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $990,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,005,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal!",1005000.0,Alice,7,
