"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and more than my minimum asking price. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This still leaves plenty of profit for you while getting me a great deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $1,200,000. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
