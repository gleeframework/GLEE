{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still a higher price than the product's value to Alice.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price slightly above Alice's value of $10,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Bob is trying to strike a balance between saving money and ensuring the deal gets done."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still too high. There are several rounds left, so Bob can continue to negotiate and try to secure a lower price. There's still a potential for a better deal, and Bob doesn't want to settle for a price he's not comfortable with."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay.  Even though rounds are running out, Bob can continue to negotiate.  While going to John might seem like the safer option, Bob is still better off trying to get a lower price from Alice.  There's still a possibility to reach an agreement at a price that is favorable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's final push. He is offering a price that is closer to Alice's last offer, but still below his maximum budget. This is a risky move, as time is running out, but it could potentially lead to a successful deal. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely have to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is too close to Bob's maximum budget and only one round remains.  There is very little room for further negotiation, and Bob is unlikely to get a significantly better deal.  Given the time constraints, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $15,000, ensuring he gets the product while minimizing risk and maximizing time efficiency."
