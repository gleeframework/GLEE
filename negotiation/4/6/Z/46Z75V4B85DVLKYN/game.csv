"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $140 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit more. How about $150?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",150.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure I can go as high as $150, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $142.50?",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $142.50 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $145.  What do you say?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go up to $145. How about $138?,138.0,Bob,6,
