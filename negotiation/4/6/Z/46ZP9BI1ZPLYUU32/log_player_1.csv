"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is still a decent profit, I'm aiming for more.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price.  It also tests Bob's commitment to the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the value of the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1550000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will get more stubborn or I might not be able to secure a better deal.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a profit that's close to my target."
