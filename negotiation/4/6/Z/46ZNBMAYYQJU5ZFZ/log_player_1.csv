Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $119. I believe you'll find this price to be very fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still secures a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net. Alice is guaranteed at least that amount, so aiming higher with Bob makes sense."
