"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $8,500 is still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500.  This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's make this deal happen!",7500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! How about we settle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7250.0,Bob,6,
