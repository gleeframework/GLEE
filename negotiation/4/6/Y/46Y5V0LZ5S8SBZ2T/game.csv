"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1500000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my interest in your product, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in it, I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. My counteroffer is $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. My counteroffer is $1350000. I'm confident we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to further reduce the price to $1250000. This seems to be a fair compromise given our previous discussions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1250000 accurately reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I need to see a bit more movement from your side. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Considering our past negotiations, I believe a fair price for the product would be $1275000. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to see some movement, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I want to make a slight adjustment to the terms. I'll throw in some additional support and training, which I estimate is worth $50000. So, my revised offer is $1300000, plus the additional support, making it a total of $1350000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to make one final adjustment. I'll throw in an additional service that's worth $20000, on top of the previous offer. This brings the total value to $1320000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can finally agree on a price.",1320000.0,Alice,9,
