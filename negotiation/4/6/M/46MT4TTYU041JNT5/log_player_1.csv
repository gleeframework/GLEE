Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation but higher enough to maximize her own profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $1,150,000, starting slightly higher leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle down the price. 
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John. This gives her leverage in the negotiation, as she doesn't *need* to go below a certain price point."
