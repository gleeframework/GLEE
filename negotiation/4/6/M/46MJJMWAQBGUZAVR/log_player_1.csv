``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It allows for some potential negotiation, but it's also above your minimum price, giving you room to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low at this point.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for some savings for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $1080000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob."
