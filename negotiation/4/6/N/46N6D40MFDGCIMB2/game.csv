"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000, which I believe reflects its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable compromise for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $900,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're serious about making a deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,6,
