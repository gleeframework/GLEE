"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better price. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but I want to see how much Alice is willing to compromise. It's likely she'll counter with a higher price, but it will give us a better understanding of the negotiation range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $350,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than what I'm aiming for. I have 7 rounds left to negotiate and there's still room for Alice to drop her price further.  I'll continue to push for a lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still a significant discount from Alice's latest offer. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has come down from her initial asking price.  $325,000 is a good price for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to haggle. We're getting close to the middle ground, and with only 5 rounds left, it's likely that I won't get a significantly better offer."
