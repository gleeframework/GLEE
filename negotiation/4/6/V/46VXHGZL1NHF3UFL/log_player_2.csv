"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer, allowing you to save even more."
