# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a steal at this price, considering how much you value it at $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000 and also better than buying from John for $15,000.  Accepting her offer saves you $1,000."
