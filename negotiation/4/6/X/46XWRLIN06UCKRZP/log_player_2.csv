"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something special, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for your maximum price. You have a guaranteed alternative with John at the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you no downside, as you can still get the product from John. This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a lower price if Alice decides to negotiate."
