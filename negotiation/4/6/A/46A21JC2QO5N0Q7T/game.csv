"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I hope you can see the value in this product and meet me at this price.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $11,500?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I hope you can understand that this product is worth more to me than that.",13000.0,Alice,7,
