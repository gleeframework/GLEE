"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm hoping we can land somewhere closer to $9,500. That would still give you a great deal on the product, while also allowing me to make a fair profit.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,250 still feels a bit low.  Considering the value of the product, and the fact that I have other buyers interested, I'm hoping we can settle on $9,400.  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let me know what you think!",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $9,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make a decision soon.",9000.0,Bob,6,
