"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial value, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a chance you can get closer to your target price or even get Alice to match John's $10,000 offer."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to my goal of $10,000. I'm offering a price that's halfway between her offer and my maximum. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair compromise that considers your budget while still allowing me to get a reasonable price for my product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm going to counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target price.  There's a chance she might be willing to accept my offer or at least come down even further to a price I can afford."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to offer $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows me to get a good deal while still leaving you with a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is another small step closer to my target price. It's still above John's offer, but I'm hoping that Alice will see it as a reasonable compromise and be willing to accept it.  I'm also trying to signal that I'm serious about buying the product but won't be pushed beyond my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. This offer is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is stuck at $11,000, which is above my maximum budget.  Continuing to negotiate with her is unlikely to bring the price down further. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring I get the best possible price within my budget."
