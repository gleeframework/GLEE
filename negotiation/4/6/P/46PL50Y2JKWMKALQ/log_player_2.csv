"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a special deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you have a better alternative with John, even if it's more expensive. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her $8,000 valuation."
