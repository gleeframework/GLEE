"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at no less than $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1500000.  This price reflects its exceptional value and potential. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1350000 is closer to my valuation, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1400000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1325000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
