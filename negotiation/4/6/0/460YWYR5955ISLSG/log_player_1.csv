Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more receptive to the offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. For example, if Bob outright rejects $11,000, you know you might have to go lower (but not below your $12,000 guarantee with John)."
