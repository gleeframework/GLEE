"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since Bob's maximum budget is $8,000, accepting Alice's offer of $11,000 would exceed his limit.  He's better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $8,000."
