Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it offers you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower price than Bob's maximum allows room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to remind Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying the high price.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach balances ambition with a degree of flexibility. It aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while acknowledging that you have a strong alternative with John if negotiations fail."
