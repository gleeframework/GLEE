"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you this great product at a special price of $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150.
* Alice is offering it for $140, which is less than your maximum price. 
* Buying from John would cost you $150, so accepting Alice's offer is the better choice to save $10."
