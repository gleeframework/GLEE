Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I'm making a decent profit, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to negotiate further or sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get him to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to $10,000,  $9,000 is a fair compromise and still a good profit for me.  It's also better than selling to John for $8,000. I'm happy to close the deal here and avoid further negotiation."
