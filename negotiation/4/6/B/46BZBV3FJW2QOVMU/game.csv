"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the value you've outlined. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,325,000, which is a fair compromise and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,335,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1335000.0,Alice,5,
