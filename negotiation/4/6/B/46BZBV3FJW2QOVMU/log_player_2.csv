"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,400,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There is room for negotiation as Alice's minimum price is $1,200,000, and I am willing to pay up to $1,500,000. 
* **Saving money is a priority:** I want to save as much money as possible, so I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high, but closer:**  $1,350,000 is closer to my target, but I can still try to push for a lower price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Alice is willing to compromise, indicating a possible deal.
* **Maximizing savings:**  I want to try to get the product for as close to $1,300,000 as possible."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,325,000, which is a fair compromise and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,335,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Alice's offer of $1,335,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,325,000.
* **Final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, so further negotiation might be futile.
* **Significant savings:** Accepting this offer saves me $165,000 compared to buying from John.

While I'd prefer to pay $1,325,000, the potential for further negotiation is low, and accepting this offer ensures a good deal."
