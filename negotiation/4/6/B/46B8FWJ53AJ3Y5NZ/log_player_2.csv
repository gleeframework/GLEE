Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $8,000. Let's try to find a middle ground.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her latest offer is still above your maximum price. You have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation with Alice, as she might not go any lower."
