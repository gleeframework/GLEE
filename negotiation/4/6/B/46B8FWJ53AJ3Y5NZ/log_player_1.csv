"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* This initial offer allows for 8 more rounds to potentially increase the price closer to my desired $15,000, or to accept a lower price if necessary to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and even below what I consider the minimum acceptable value. While it's tempting to take $5,000, I still have 9 rounds to negotiate and can try to get a better price.  Selling to John for $15,000 is the best outcome, but I'll try to see if I can get closer to that with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $8,000. Let's try to find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. 
* My counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* The message emphasizes the value to Bob, highlighting that $9,000 is still a good deal for him.
* This move allows for further negotiation while keeping the price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and do $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my desired price and my minimum acceptable value. I'm not desperate to sell and still have 6 rounds left to try and get closer to my target. 

I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price or, as a last resort, sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with $8,500:**  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but not to undervalue my product.
* **Focusing on the Value:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, making it a more attractive proposition for him.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** By suggesting a compromise, I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation in the next rounds.  This strategy allows me to potentially reach a more favorable price while still having the option to sell to John if necessary."
