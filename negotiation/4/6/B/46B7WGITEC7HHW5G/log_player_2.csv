"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget.**  Bob is willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is less than that.

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and save $200,000."
