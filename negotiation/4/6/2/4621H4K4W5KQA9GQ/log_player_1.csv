I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $13,500.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get closer to my desired price."

Bob is firm on his offer, and I've already compromised twice.  I'm confident I can get the same price from John, and it saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
