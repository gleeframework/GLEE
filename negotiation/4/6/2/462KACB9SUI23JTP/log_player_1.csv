Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  I know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John.

By offering the product at $140, I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's valuation but potentially attractive enough for him to consider. If he rejects the offer, I don't lose anything because I can sell it to John at my desired price."
