"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13500? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet at $12500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $13000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $12800? I'm willing to pay a bit more to get the deal done, but I need to stay within my limits.",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12800 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about $12900? It's just a small increase, and it allows us to close this deal.",12900.0,Alice,7,
