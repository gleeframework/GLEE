Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me at this price?

Round 6

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  The negotiations with Bob have reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a price that's significantly higher than John's offer.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale and avoid further risk of a lower price."
