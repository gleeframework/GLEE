Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer based on his response, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I'll counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering $120 as a counter-offer.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still being above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation. It's also important to consider the potential time and effort involved in further negotiation, which could ultimately lead to the same outcome or worse."
