"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price of $13,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, increasing your potential savings."
