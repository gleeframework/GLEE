"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was wondering if you could lower the price a bit. I'm looking to spend no more than $80 on the product. Would you consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $95?  That gives you a good price and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm still looking for a price closer to my limit of $80. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between $80 and $95?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit away from $85, but let's see if we can find common ground. How about $90? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to stick closer to my budget of $80. Could we possibly agree on $85?",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm very close to selling to someone else for $100.  This is truly my last offer, and I hope we can agree.  $90 is the absolute lowest I can go.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget of $80. I believe we might be able to reach an agreement if you could lower your price slightly. Could you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,8,
