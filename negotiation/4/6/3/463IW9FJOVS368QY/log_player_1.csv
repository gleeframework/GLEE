``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also framing it positively by highlighting the value of the product and the potential for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum value of $8,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground, I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $8,500. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm also keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8000? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
