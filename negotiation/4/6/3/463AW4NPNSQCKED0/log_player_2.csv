"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  It's important to negotiate a better price and work towards a more agreeable outcome.  We have plenty of rounds to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and conveys continued interest in the product, encouraging further discussion.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to our desired range while leaving space for potential compromises in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is far below what I'm willing to accept for this product. How about we split the difference and settle for $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Price:** Alice's offer is now very close to John's price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  There's still room for negotiation. Alice is willing to move on price, indicating we might be able to secure an even better deal. 
* **Limited Downside:**  We're not losing much by continuing to negotiate since John's backup offer is always available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer suggests a price directly in the middle of our previous offer ($8,000) and Alice's current offer ($10,500). It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant saving.
* **Framing as Win-Win:**  The message emphasizes fairness and positions the offer as mutually beneficial. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We're continuing to engage in the negotiation, keeping the conversation moving toward a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is my absolute bottom line. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Offer:** Alice has now met John's price of $10,000.  There's no further benefit to negotiating with Alice, as we can get the same price from John.
* **Saving Time and Effort:** Accepting this offer allows us to close the deal now and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations that might not result in a better price. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting guarantees us the product at the desired price. There's no guarantee that continuing to negotiate with Alice would lead to a more favorable outcome."
