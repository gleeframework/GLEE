"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is far below what I'm willing to accept for this product. How about we split the difference and settle for $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal as well.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is my absolute bottom line. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
