Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

My reasoning:

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, I can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  Simply stating a high price without context is less effective.  By mentioning ""value"" and ""potential,"" I'm framing the product as a premium opportunity.
* **Leaving room for Bob:**  While I aim high, I avoid an absurd number that would immediately offend Bob. I want to engage him in a potential negotiation. 

This strategy gives me the best chance to maximize my profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
