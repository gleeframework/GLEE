"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $15,000. It's a steal, considering its true value!  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to make it work.  How about $12000?  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  $12,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price for the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the effort, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to split the difference. How about $12750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a higher price, $12,750 is a decent compromise and gets me closer to my desired value.  It's also more than what John is offering, so it's the best outcome in this scenario."
