"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is too high, and there are 9 more rounds to negotiate. Bob has a better chance of getting a lower price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000. This reflects the substantial value the product offers you, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,000,000 is closer to his goal, there's still room for negotiation and he should try to push for a lower price. He has 7 more rounds to work with, and the risk of buying from John is still there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
