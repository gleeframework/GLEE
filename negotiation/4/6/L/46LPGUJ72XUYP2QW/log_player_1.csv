"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate and Bob clearly sees value in the product, so I'm going to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000. This reflects the substantial value the product offers you, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $950,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $1,200,000, accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a deal with John, which would net me less money."
