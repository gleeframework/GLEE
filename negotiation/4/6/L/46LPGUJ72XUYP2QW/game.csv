"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000. This reflects the substantial value the product offers you, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
