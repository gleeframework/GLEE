Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $7,375. This is still a good price for the product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While we could likely negotiate a slightly lower price, Alice is clearly moving towards a reasonable middle ground. At $7,375, the potential savings of continuing to negotiate are outweighed by the risk that Alice increases her price or that we run out of rounds and are forced to buy from John at $8,000."
