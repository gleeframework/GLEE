"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price still gives you a healthy profit and leaves room for us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This price reflects a significant discount from your initial offer and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal now.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try $1,000,000.  This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
