Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, acknowledging your interest in the product.  This price still gives me a reasonable profit while remaining fair to you. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 as a final compromise. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed deal and save $50,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation rounds with Alice when you already have a better deal on the table."
