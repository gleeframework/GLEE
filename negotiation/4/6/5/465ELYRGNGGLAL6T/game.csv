"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1100000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for this product. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll need to look at other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm making a new counteroffer of $1050000. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might be leaving money on the table if we don't come to an agreement soon.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
