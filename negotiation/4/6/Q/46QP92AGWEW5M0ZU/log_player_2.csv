"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $82.50 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a price closer to $70. We have time for further negotiation."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $75? That's a fair price for both of us."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $79.50 for the product. That's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  While slightly above our target, it's a good deal compared to John's $100 price. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
