"Thanks Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a great deal for both of us!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $110. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. How about we meet at $107.50? It's a compromise that works for both of us!",107.5,Alice,5,
