It's better to reject Alice's offer. You can likely get the product for a lower price by counter-offering."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, and it's still within my budget.  I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable starting point for negotiation."

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I'm still going to reject it.  I believe I can get the product for a lower price by continuing to negotiate."

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping Alice will see that it's a fair price for both of us. If she rejects this offer, I'll buy from John."

Alice's offer is now within my budget and is close to my target price. I'm going to accept her offer and buy the product.  While I could potentially continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal is too high."
