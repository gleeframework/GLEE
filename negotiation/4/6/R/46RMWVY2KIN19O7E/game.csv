"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8000 for it. Would you be able to accommodate this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This still offers you a great value, and it's closer to my bottom line. Let's see if we can work something out.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to meet at that price point. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $8750?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
