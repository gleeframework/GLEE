Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to propose a counter-offer."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $15,000, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, it's less likely he'll go significantly below this initial figure.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly mentions being ""open to discussing"" the price, indicating flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage in a conversation rather than just saying ""no."" 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob.  Keeping this information hidden gives you more negotiating power.

It's important to remember that this is just an opening offer. Bob's response will determine your next move. You might need to be prepared to negotiate down slightly, but your goal is to maximize your profit while still ensuring a successful sale."
