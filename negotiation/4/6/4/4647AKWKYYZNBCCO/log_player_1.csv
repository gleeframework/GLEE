Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a strong position to start high. 
* **Testing the waters:** Offering it at $18,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  This price gives you space to potentially negotiate down, while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 

**Important:** It's crucial to remain confident and convey the value of the product to Bob throughout the negotiation process."
