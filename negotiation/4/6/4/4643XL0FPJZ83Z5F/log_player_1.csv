Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $120? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's within my acceptable range. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  Bob's offer of $100 is too low, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
