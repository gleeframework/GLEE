"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still fair considering the product's potential and my need to recover a substantial portion of my investment. Let's find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,550,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
