Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe could be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **High but Believable:** $1,450,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value but is still within a reasonable range considering your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning another buyer and making it a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer, you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it makes strategic sense to aim higher initially."
