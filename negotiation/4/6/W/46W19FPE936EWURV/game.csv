"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking $105 would be a good starting point. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $115, which is a fair middle ground.  Let's close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go below $130. I'm willing to meet you at $120, but that's as low as I can go.",130.0,Alice,5,
