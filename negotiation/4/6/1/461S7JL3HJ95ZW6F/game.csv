"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd like to offer $11,000. Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
