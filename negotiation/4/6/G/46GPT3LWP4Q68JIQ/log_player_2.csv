"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's close this deal!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. That's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to counter-offer again, the risk is that Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. At $1,100,000, Bob is still getting a good deal and saving $100,000 compared to buying from John."
