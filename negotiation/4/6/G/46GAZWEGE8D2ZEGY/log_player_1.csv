Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product's value, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I want to see if I can push for a higher amount.  I'll try to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,350,000. This reflects the value I'm offering while also acknowledging your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $1,325,000. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell at this point. I'll try to counter again to see if we can bridge the gap. I still have time to negotiate before considering selling to John."
