I'm going to offer a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, hoping to meet him halfway.  If he still rejects, I'll consider selling to John."

I'm going to sell to John.  It looks like Bob is not going to come up to my minimum price, and John is offering a safe and secure deal at $10,000. I'd rather take the guaranteed sale than risk getting nothing at all."
