{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity with immense value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for you.  I'm asking $1,400,000 for it. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price given the product's potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000 Offer:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, making it potentially attractive to him.
* **Positive and Engaging Message:** The message is friendly, highlighting the value of the product and encouraging a positive response from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not going for a hard-line negotiation.  By suggesting a fair price, I'm opening the door for Bob to counteroffer and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Plan B:** The John option provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1300000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential benefits this product offers. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my target. 

My counteroffer will aim to find a middle ground between $1,300,000 and my desired price, leaving room for further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,300,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product.  Let's aim for a win-win. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit significantly. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $1,350,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm flexible but also that I still value the product highly.
* **Positive and Encouraging Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the win-win potential of a deal. 
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** I've left room for Bob to counteroffer again if needed, but I've moved closer to my desired price. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  My offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't undervalue the product."
