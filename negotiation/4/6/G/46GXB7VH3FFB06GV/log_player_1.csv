Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of getting a higher price.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Open-ended Question:** Ending with a question invites Bob to engage in the conversation and makes him feel like he's part of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your kind gesture, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $75. I understand if this doesn't work for you, but I wanted to give it a try. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price through a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering with $85, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Compromise:**  I emphasize the willingness to compromise, making it seem like I'm trying to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Open-ended Question:**  The question at the end invites further negotiation and keeps the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $80 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise given the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would love to get more, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of potentially selling to John for the same amount."
