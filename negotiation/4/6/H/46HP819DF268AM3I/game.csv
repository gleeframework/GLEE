"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to  $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks again for working with me.  I'm getting close to my limit, but I can do $800,000 for this.  It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close if you are.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $800,000. I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,7,
