It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but we can likely do better."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a significant counteroffer.  $500,000 is a big jump down from Alice's initial offer, but it shows our serious intent to negotiate."

$600,000 is still a bit high.  We should try to get closer to our initial counteroffer of $500,000."

While $650,000 is lower than Alice's first offer, it's still higher than our target. We should continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our desired price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}

We're getting closer to a deal, but we're still looking to save more.  $650,000 seems like a fair price for both of us, given the rounds of negotiation we've already had."
