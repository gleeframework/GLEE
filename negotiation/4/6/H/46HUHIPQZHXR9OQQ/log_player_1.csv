Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to negotiate for a better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $80 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $110? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

While it's not the $120 I hoped for, getting $110 from Bob is better than settling for John's $100 offer."
