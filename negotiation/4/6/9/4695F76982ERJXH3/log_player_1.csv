Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it's worth at least $8,000, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price of $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the $8,000 figure, I'm subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind while suggesting the product might be even more valuable to others.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While I have John as a backup, my goal is to maximize profit, so I don't want to reveal this information to Bob.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure the highest possible price:** If Bob accepts, I've exceeded my minimum and his perceived value.
2. **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, I can always lower the price, knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000."
