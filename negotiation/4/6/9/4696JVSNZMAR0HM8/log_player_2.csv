"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's a potential for a deal that benefits both parties.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you can still acquire the product, but it will be at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to have to counter with $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** It's below your maximum of $1,500,000.
* **It's a good compromise.** Alice moved closer to your counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Further negotiation might be risky.**  While you could try for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Buying from John would be more expensive."
