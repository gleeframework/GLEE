"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a final price well above your minimum.
* **Value-Based Language:** Highlighting the product's ""immense value and potential"" and framing it as an ""investment"" helps justify the high price and appeals to Bob's potential profit motive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states it's a ""starting price,"" signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving room to adjust in subsequent rounds based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high.  Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm eager to move forward, but I'm open to discussing a compromise if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both your asking price and your minimum acceptable price.  You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John right now would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is thoughtful,  the value of this product is significantly higher than what you've proposed. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  Starting by acknowledging Bob's offer (""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate..."") maintains a positive and respectful negotiation environment.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Re-emphasizing the product's high value (""...the value of this product is significantly higher..."") reinforces your position and justifies the high price.
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  Decreasing your offer by $300,000 (from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000) shows flexibility and a willingness to move towards a deal, but not too drastically. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price well above your minimum. 
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:**  Framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal for both of us"" aims to create a sense of balance and mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1,550,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm approaching my maximum budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, Bob has signaled this is his ""final offer"" and is approaching his budget limit. Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further lowballing in later rounds."
