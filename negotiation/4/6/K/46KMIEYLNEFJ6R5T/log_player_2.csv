"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is better than John's offer, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us, given the potential returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price. While $1,100,000 is closer to his target, it's still above his desired price.  Rejecting the offer again allows him to continue negotiating and potentially reach an even lower price."

This is a good compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product fairly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
