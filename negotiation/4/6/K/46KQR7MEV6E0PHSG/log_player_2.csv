"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely counter-offer and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price.  Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you a better chance of reaching a favorable outcome. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help you gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to come down considerably, it might be worth continuing negotiations. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down significantly, $12,000 is still above your $10,000 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to meet ""halfway"" suggests there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John is the Backup:** Keep in mind that John offers a firm $10,000. You have leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? I feel that's a fair offer, considering my constraints."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Your Limit:** You're now offering your maximum price. This is a strategic move.
* **Being Firm but Fair:** Your message explains that this is your budget limit.
* **Putting the Ball in Her Court:** It's up to Alice to decide if she wants to make a deal or risk losing you as a buyer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At an Impasse:** Alice has made it clear that $11,500 is her absolute lowest price. 
* **Not Worth the Extra Cost:** While $1,500 isn't a huge difference, you've reached the point where the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of further negotiation. 
* **John is Reliable:** You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000. It's time to take that offer."
