Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get even more from Bob. 
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high price close to your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it gives you room to negotiate downwards while still staying above your minimum.
* **Slight Discount:**  The $1 discount makes the offer seem more appealing, potentially swaying Bob psychologically. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob. However, there's a chance he might reject the offer outright.  You'll need to decide if you want to try further negotiation with Bob or go straight to John if he rejects the initial offer."
