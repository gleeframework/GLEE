Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to get a reasonable return on your investment.

Bob's offer:
