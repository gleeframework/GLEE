"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product for a price that I believe is fair. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to get a reasonable return on your investment.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for this product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to make a profit as well.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it gives you a good return on your investment. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",900000.0,Bob,6,
