"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I see the potential in this product,  $2,300,000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, recognizing the value it holds for you.  This is the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too far below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's say $1,900,000. This accounts for the value it offers both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, recognizing the potential of the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and should be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a reasonable compromise, but $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than our minimum and John's offer.  We need to incentivize Bob to move closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still out of my range.  I can go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer and shows my commitment to finding common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob is making more significant jumps, we're still below our minimum and John's offer. We're getting closer to a point where we might need to consider John if Bob doesn't make a considerable move soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm determined to make this deal work, but  $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000,  which is a significant increase from my last offer and reflects my genuine interest in this product.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has indicated this is his final offer. While we've made progress, his final offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. It's no longer strategically sound to continue negotiations with Bob when we have a guaranteed sale at a higher price with John."
