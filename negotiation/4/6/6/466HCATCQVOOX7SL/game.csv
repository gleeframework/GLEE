,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $900,000 is a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,050,000, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,025,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but not by much. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a 2-year warranty on the product. That's a $20,000 value, absolutely free. So, the total value you'll get is $1,070,000.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the warranty offer, Alice, but the price is creeping back up.  To be fair,  $1,010,000 is the best I can do.",1010000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to throw in another sweetener - I'll include a free setup and installation service, valued at $15,000. So, the total value you'll get is $1,065,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",1065000.0,Alice,9,
