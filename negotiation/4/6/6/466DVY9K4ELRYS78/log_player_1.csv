{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $900,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal given the significant return you stand to gain."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice is unwilling to sell for less than $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible without losing Bob's business. 
* **The Offer:** $900,000 leaves a comfortable profit margin for Bob ($100,000) while securing a significant profit for Alice ($100,000 above her minimum).

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing Alice's profit and making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
