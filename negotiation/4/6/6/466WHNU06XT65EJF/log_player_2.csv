"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for $800,000, which is less than Alice's offer.
