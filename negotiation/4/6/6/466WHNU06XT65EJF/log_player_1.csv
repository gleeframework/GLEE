Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for significantly above Bob's perceived value might lead to a  negotiation where you still end up with a price well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, implying exclusivity and a potential bidding war  might encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone suggests you're willing to discuss the price, which can be crucial in a high-stakes negotiation. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is a risky strategy. There's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer without further negotiation. However, given your fallback option, it might be worth the gamble for a potentially much higher profit."
