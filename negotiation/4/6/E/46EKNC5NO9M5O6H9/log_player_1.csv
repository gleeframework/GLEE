Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know you'll appreciate its value. I'm asking for $100, which is a fair price considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $120. Aiming for a price close to this maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $100 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling around $90-$95.
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  The price is significantly higher than John's offer of $80, ensuring a better profit if Bob accepts. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
