"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice's offer is $1,100,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  But it's best to explore all options with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer below Alice's price:**  You are starting your negotiation with a lower price than Alice's initial offer. This shows your willingness to negotiate but also highlights the price difference.
* **Reasonable starting point:** $950,000 is a good starting point because it is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum price of $800,000. 
* **Open to compromise:** The message highlights your willingness to find a solution that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $950000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price still reflects the significant value the product offers you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to your target price, $1,000,000 is still above what you're aiming for.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Alice has shown flexibility by lowering her price. You should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. 
* **John's offer is a backup:** You can always buy from John, but it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice first."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000.  I'm still a little high, but I'm willing to go to $975,000. Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's offer:** You're increasing your offer, showing that you're serious about making a deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $975000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap just a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $990000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility:** She's come down significantly from her initial price, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **You're still close to your target:** $990,000 is just $20,000 above your desired price of $970,000.  There's still room for negotiation to potentially save even more.
* **Time is on your side:**  You have several rounds left to continue negotiating, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price that's still a little high."
