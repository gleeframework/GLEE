Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This gives me room for negotiation if needed.
* **Value Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing my bottom line. This might encourage Bob to consider a price above his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By not starting at my absolute highest, I signal to Bob that there might be some flexibility in the price.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still securing a sale."
