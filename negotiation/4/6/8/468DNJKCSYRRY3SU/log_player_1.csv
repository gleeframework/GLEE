{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone for the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is a decent price, it's still below the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $135. This still allows me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
