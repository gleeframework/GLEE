{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $175 is higher than Bob's $100 valuation, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $175 is still above your $150 minimum, so you're not losing money if Bob accepts.
* **It sets a tone:**  By starting high, you establish a stronger bargaining position and show that you're confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep my budget under $100. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to budge much further. At this point, it's better to sell to John for $150 and guarantee a profit."
