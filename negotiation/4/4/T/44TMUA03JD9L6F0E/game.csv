"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $12750? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise that respects the value of the product while fitting within my financial limits.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12750. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to meet you at $13250. This is as low as I can go while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still aiming to keep the price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $13000? I believe this would be a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'm willing to meet you at $13500. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your final offer. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. However, I am still unable to meet you at $13500. Considering my budget constraints, could we perhaps agree on $13200? I believe this would be a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits.",13200.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $13500, and I've already made a concession to meet you at that price. I'm not willing to make another concession. I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer and consider other options. However, I'd like to give you one last chance to reconsider and meet me at $13500. If not, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",13500.0,Alice,9,
