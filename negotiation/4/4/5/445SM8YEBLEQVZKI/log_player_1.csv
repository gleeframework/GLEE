Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A price of $19,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other potential buyers, you incentivize Bob to consider the offer seriously and potentially act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't need to sell the product immediately. If you need the money urgently, offering a price closer to $15,000 would be wiser.
*  Gauge Bob's interest and adjust your approach accordingly. If he seems very interested, you might be able to maintain the higher price."
