"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000.  I'm confident this product has great value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $680,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's make this happen.",680000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $680,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",675000.0,Alice,5,
