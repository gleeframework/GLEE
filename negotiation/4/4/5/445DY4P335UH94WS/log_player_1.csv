Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to start high to give yourself room to negotiate but still stay within a reasonable range for Bob. 

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, giving you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message encourages Bob to engage in negotiation.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower, but never below your minimum.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, you might be more flexible with the price.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob to reach a mutually agreeable price."
