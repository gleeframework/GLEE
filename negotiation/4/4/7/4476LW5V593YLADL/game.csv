"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that benefits us both.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $1,400,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is closer to the value this product offers.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,650,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, how about $1,500,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to finalize the transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
