,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you. Let me know if this revised price is acceptable.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1400000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial price, and it reflects my desire to close a deal with you. Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your compromise,  $1600000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1500000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
