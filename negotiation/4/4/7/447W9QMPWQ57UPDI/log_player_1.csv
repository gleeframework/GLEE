Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is too far below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1400000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,400,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial price, and it reflects my desire to close a deal with you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your compromise,  $1600000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1500000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly what I would get selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
