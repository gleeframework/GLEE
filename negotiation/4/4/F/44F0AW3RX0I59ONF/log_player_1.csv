Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a better outcome. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $100 positions it as a potential gain for Bob (who values it at $80) while still leaving you a profit margin.
* **First Offer Advantage:**  By making the first offer, you set the initial negotiation point. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between potential profit and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
