# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run.  Let me know if you're interested, but please make a decision quickly as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's no need to spend the extra $100,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and maximize your savings."
