"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but I'm not quite ready to meet that price point. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. While the product is valuable, my budget is firm. I can go up to $950,000. If that's not doable, I might have to explore other options, though I'd prefer to work with you.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price.

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm very close to my limit, but I can offer $975,000 as my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to go with another option.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $975,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1,050,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to reconsider selling the product to someone else.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
