# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm offering you a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum price of $150 and also cheaper than buying from John for $150. You save money and get the product."
