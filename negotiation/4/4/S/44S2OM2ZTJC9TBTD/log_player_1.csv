{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Flexibility:** This price leaves space for potential counteroffers from Bob while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm keeping John, the alternative buyer, in mind, as a backup option if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Difference:** Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Space:** I still have room to negotiate a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John as Backup:**  I can still sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $105 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price is still significantly above Bob's initial offer but below my original ask, keeping a healthy profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and conversational tone, aiming to keep the negotiations open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still thinking $90 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Even though Bob has increased his offer to $95, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $150 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This price allows me to cover my costs and still offer you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Compromise:**  This is my final compromise, as I'm already offering a price closer to Bob's desired value.
* **Reasoning:**  I clearly explain my rationale for the price, emphasizing my need to cover costs while still offering a good deal.
* **Open to Agreement:** I use positive language, signaling my desire to reach an agreement and avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $92.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:**  Bob's final offer of $92.50 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  Further negotiations are unlikely to result in a significantly higher offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a substantial profit and ensures I meet my minimum price requirement."
