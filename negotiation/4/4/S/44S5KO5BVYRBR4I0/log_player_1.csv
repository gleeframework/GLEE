Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet you at $1,200,000. I would like to counter with $1,150,000 for the product.

Explanation:  While I could push for more, accepting $1,150,000 is a strong return. It exceeds Bob's perceived value and provides a significant profit over John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate or Bob lowering his offer."
