{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  I'm confident Bob will want to negotiate, and I'll be prepared to counter his offers while keeping my goal of maximizing profit in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little. I'm still pretty set on  $1,100,000.  If you can't do that, I understand, but it would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is being stubborn and unwilling to budge on his price. While I'd love to close the deal with him, I don't want to risk losing out on a better price.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is more than what Bob is offering and meets my minimum requirement.  It's time to move on and secure a more profitable sale."
