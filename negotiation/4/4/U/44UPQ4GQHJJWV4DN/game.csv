"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I think it's a bit above what I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. ",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",9250.0,Bob,4,
