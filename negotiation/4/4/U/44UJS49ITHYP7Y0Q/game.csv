"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $12,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
