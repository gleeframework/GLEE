Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his latest offer is still below John's guaranteed price. It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer within the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
