Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some potential negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it still allows me to achieve my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to justify the risk of further negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, and I'm not comfortable risking that for a small potential gain."
