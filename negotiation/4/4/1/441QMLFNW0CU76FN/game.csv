"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I value this product, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm ready to pay $1,275,000.  This is a very reasonable price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet your price of $1,275,000. I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, so I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,285,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a great value for the product. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal.",1285000.0,Alice,5,
