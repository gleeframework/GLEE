Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers, creating a sense of scarcity and urgency.
* **Negotiation Room:** The high price leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere closer to $1,750,000 or even higher.

**Important:** This strategy involves risk. If Bob is turned off by the high price, you'll have to settle for John's offer. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price with Bob makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
