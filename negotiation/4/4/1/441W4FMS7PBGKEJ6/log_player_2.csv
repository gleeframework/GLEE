"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let you have it for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $15,000 to Alice."
