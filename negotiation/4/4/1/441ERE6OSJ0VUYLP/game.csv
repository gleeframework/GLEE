"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $150?  That's my absolute top limit, and I think it's fair considering the product is worth $150 to you.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your top limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $165. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm firm on $150.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're firm on $150, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and sell it to you for $157.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $157.50 is still a bit higher than I can go. Let's split the difference at $153.75. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finally close this deal.",153.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $155. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.",155.0,Alice,7,
