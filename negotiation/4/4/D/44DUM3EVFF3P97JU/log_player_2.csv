{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's value.  This is a strong opening move that demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate but also his understanding of the product's worth.  By offering $12,000, Bob leaves room for further negotiation while still being significantly below Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still potential to negotiate further. Bob is aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows Bob to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  $12,500 is a fair middle ground between his last offer and Alice's current offer.  This move shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is still trying to get the best possible price."
