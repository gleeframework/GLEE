{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  However, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a higher perceived value of $1,500,000 sets an anchor in Bob's mind, making the offer of $1,250,000 seem more reasonable. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer aims to split the potential profit margin ($500,000) with Bob. This creates a win-win scenario where Bob gets the product for less than his perceived value, and Alice earns a significant profit above her minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency with a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Important Considerations:**

While John guarantees $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a better outcome for Alice. However, it's crucial to strike a balance â€“ an overly ambitious price might make Bob reject the offer outright."
