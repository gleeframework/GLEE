"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, and John is willing to sell it for $100,  Alice's offer of $120 is not a good deal.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob can still get the product from John for $100. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $110 is closer, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and I pay $105? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, even though it's getting closer.  With only 5 rounds left, it's not clear that Alice will come down to a price Bob is comfortable with. To avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product for his desired price, Bob will choose to buy from John for $100."
