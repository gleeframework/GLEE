Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?,120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $110 is closer, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and I pay $105? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
