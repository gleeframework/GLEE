Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I know this product is quite valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you before I go to other buyers. I think a price of $950,000 reflects its significant worth."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, aiming higher with Bob could yield more profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a price that's still highly profitable for you (above your $1,000,000 minimum). 
* **High but Understandable:** The price is high but justifiable given the product's value to Bob ($800,000) and your knowledge of his interest.

This strategy balances risk and reward, giving you the best chance of exceeding your minimum acceptable price."
