It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have a lot of room to go lower than $850,000 before reaching your maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It demonstrates your serious interest in buying the product while also making it clear that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but it's still worth seeing if you can push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to your ideal price."

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that you're willing to meet Alice halfway. It's still significantly lower than her previous offer, but it demonstrates your genuine interest in purchasing the product."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price that's very close to your last counteroffer.  At this point, the potential savings by continuing to negotiate are small, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is higher.  It's likely Alice is close to her bottom line, and accepting the offer is the most prudent decision."
