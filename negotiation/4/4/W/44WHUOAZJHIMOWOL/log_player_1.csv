Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is significantly higher than your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, making it attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's enough wiggle room on both sides to allow for some back and forth. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, you still have room to negotiate. You can likely get a higher price than $90 by countering Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  I'm confident you'll find this a good deal, given the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is a good deal, considering your minimum price is $80. While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of losing the sale entirely to John exists.  It's generally better to accept a reasonable offer rather than risk getting nothing."
