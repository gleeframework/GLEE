"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value, potentially worth far more than $1000000. I understand you may not know its full worth, but I believe it could be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to let you acquire it for $1500000.  This is a significant investment, but the potential return could be equally substantial. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
