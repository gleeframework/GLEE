"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I understand it's valuable to you, but this is the maximum I can offer.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $12,000 and $15,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  Let's try $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $12,000 and $13,000. How about we try $12,800? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,800 is closer, I'm still just a bit over my budget. Would you consider $12,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $12,800. How about we try $12,650? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make one more compromise to reach an agreement.",12650.0,Alice,7,
