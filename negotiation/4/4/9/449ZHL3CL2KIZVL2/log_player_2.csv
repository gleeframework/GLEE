Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $12,000 and $15,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Alice has come down a bit, $13,000 is still above my budget. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $12,000, and I'm confident I can negotiate further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,500 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $12,000 and $13,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $12,800. How about we try $12,650? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make one more compromise to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,650

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still above my budget, and we're running out of time.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll accept a lower price. It's safer to buy from John at $12,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
