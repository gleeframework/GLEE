Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is within my budget and represents a significant concession from her initial price.  While I'd prefer to pay less, accepting this offer allows me to secure the product without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal. It's important to remember that I can always buy from John for $800,000 if this deal falls through, but I prefer to get the best possible price from Alice."
