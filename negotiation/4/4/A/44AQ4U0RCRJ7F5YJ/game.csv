"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $13,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $13,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  If you're serious about selling this product, this is the best I can do.",12500.0,Bob,4,
