"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.
