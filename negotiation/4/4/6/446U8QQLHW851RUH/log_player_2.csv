"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,500. I think it's a fair price that reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $14,500 from John, so there's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still hoping to get the product for a lower price. While $14,000 is better than $14,500, it's still higher than his ideal price. There's room to negotiate further."
