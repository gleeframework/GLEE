"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for the best possible value, I want to make this work.  Let's settle at $11,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. $11,000 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. How about we try $10,800? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",10800.0,Bob,6,
