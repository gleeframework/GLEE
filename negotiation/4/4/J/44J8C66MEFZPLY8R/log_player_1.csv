{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,100,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,100,500 is still a good deal for me, especially considering the risk of further negotiations or selling to John. It's time to close the deal and secure a profit."
