"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $13,000 is more than his budget and it's worth negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  I think that's a fair price that would be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,250 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's only in round 3, and there's still room for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a little high for me.  Let's try $10,500. That's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford, and it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
