"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to be at $900,000 for this to make sense. Do you think we can make that work?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. But $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us move forward.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $910,000?  This is a fair offer and allows us both to benefit. ",910000.0,Bob,6,
