You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down a bit in price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, it's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, as it's a guaranteed price within his budget.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks either her refusing to budge further or forcing Bob into a price he's not comfortable with."
