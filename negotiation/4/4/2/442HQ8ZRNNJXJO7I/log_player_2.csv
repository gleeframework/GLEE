"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still willing to pay less than $11,000, and he can either counteroffer again or buy from John if negotiations don't work out."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer a lower price, $11,250 is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  Since Alice has indicated this is her final offer, further negotiation is unlikely to result in a lower price."
