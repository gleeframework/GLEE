{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know the value is right there.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It reflects the product's worth to both of us, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will be interested, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he doesn't see the value. I'm always prepared to sell to John for $1,000,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider  $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is a decent amount, it's significantly lower than the product's true worth.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't undervalue my product.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting the value of the product while also giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is a good compromise.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent amount of money, and it seems like Bob is serious about buying the product.  I'd rather sell to Bob for $800,000 than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
