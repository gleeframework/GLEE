"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at $160. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $160 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my top price ($80) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. This tactic might make Alice more willing to move down from her initial high price.
* **Expressing Interest:** While lowballing, it's important to show genuine interest in the product. This makes it clear I'm not just wasting her time and that a deal is possible. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $60, I leave a $20 gap between my offer and my walk-away price, and a much larger gap for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $60 is too low, Alice. How about meeting halfway at $85? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price exactly halfway between my last offer ($60) and her counteroffer ($110). This shows a willingness to negotiate and move towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While $85 is slightly above my ideal limit, it keeps me in the game and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it.
* **Sense of Fairness:**  Presenting the offer as a ""fair compromise"" can make Alice more receptive."
