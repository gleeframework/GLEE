Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is a good starting point as it's more than Bob's valuation but less than my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and leaving room for negotiation.  This encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** By starting high, I leave room to negotiate down while still earning more than my minimum. 
* **Encourage negotiation:** A clear message invites Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Maintain control:** I can always choose to accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my original offer, it's not a price I'm willing to accept at this point. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Continue negotiation:** I can try to reach a more favorable price by sending a counteroffer. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  My ability to sell to John for a higher price gives me bargaining power.

I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $1,150,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's last offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a compromise and reiterating the value of the product to Bob. This encourages Bob to see the offer as a fair step towards an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain my position:** I'm not willing to go lower than $1,150,000 at this point, as I'm confident I can get a better price from John if needed.
* **Push for a resolution:**  By making a clear counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Stay flexible:**  I'm leaving room to negotiate further if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer, and I would like to counter with a price of $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this price is reasonable given the value it holds for me, and it represents a significant compromise from my initial offer. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to drop my price further, especially since John is offering a price significantly higher than that.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I:

* **Maximize my profit:**  I'll secure my desired price of $1,500,000, which is significantly better than any offer Bob has made.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  This ends the negotiations with Bob, saving me time and effort.
* **Utilize my leverage:**  John's offer serves as a strong bargaining chip, allowing me to walk away from Bob's lower offer."
