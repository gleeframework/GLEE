"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It makes more sense to counteroffer or go straight to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your budget, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so it makes sense to either counteroffer again or go straight to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's final offer is still above his budget, and he's already rejected her counteroffer twice. There's a good chance any further negotiation will result in Alice's offer staying above his budget. It's more efficient to buy from John at this point."
