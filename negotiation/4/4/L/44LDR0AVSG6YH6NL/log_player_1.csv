Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer him.  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $975,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for Bob, but it gets me closer to my goal of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  Bob's counteroffer of $925,000 is too far below my desired price point and it's getting increasingly clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  Selling to John guarantees me the maximum profit."
