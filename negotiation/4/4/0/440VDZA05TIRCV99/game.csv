"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your offer while still valuing our product, I would like to suggest a price of $125. This is slightly above your proposed $100, but still within a reasonable range. I hope this proposal works for you. Looking forward to your response.",125.0,Alice,3,
