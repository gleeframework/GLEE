# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your needs and exceed your expectations.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the value of our product and your budget, I am willing to accept $117 for it.
