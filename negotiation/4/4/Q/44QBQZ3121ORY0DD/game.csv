"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $1100000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This is a fair price, given my budget and the value I'm looking for in this product.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $1275000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to know you're willing to meet me halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1250000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm counting on you to make a decision.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
