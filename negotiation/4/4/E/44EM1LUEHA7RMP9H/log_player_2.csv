"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $8,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $8,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, Bob can still potentially get a lower price.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility. There's still room to close the gap.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to try for an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $7,500.  How about $7,250? I believe this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7250} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $7,250 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,400. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has successfully negotiated the price down from $8,000 to $7,400.  While he could try to get a lower price, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and he'll be forced to buy from John for $10,000.  Accepting the offer at $7,400 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product."
