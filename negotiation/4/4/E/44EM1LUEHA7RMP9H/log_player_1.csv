Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $8,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
