Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profits.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is not too far off from Bob's value, allowing for potential negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A positive message encourages Bob to engage and potentially accept the offer.
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option, allowing me to end the negotiation with Bob if it doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value ($10,000).**  
* **I have a better alternative (selling to John for $10,000).** 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.  I can try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a win for both of us.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Open:**  By offering a specific price, I'm encouraging Bob to make a decision and potentially move the negotiation forward.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $9,250 is still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Goal:**  $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value ($10,000). 
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  There's a chance I could get a higher price if I reject and make a counteroffer, but the risk is that Bob might walk away.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer and potentially lead to a lower price in the end.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that is good enough to meet my needs."
