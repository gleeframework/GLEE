Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to secure a higher price.  I'll counter his offer again in the next round.  It's worth exploring if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before I have to consider selling to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $13700. Would you be willing to consider $13500? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this is a fair price considering our previous offers.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing out on this deal completely by trying to squeeze out another few hundred dollars. It's a reasonable price, and I'm confident I can find another buyer for a higher price later if necessary."
