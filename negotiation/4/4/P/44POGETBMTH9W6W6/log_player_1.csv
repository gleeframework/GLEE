Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has a clear incentive to negotiate, knowing he values the product at $10,000.  
* **It's not too high:**  If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for $8,000, which is your floor price. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, you create an opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement."
