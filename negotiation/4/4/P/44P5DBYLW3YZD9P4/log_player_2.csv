"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $10,000. He starts with a counteroffer of $10,500, hoping to meet Alice halfway. This offer is still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her minimum valuation of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. There's still room for compromise, and Bob might be able to secure a price closer to his desired range with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at that point."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his previous offer of $10,500. This shows that he's serious about getting a deal but is also willing to be firm. He's hopeful that Alice will finally accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for her."
