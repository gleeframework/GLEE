Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" encourage Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal. 
* **Backup Option:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, so there's a safety net if Bob rejects the offer."
