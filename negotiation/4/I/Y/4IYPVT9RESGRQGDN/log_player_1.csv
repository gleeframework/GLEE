I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take the $7,000, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target price of $8,000. I'm also mindful of the time pressure, so I'll make a more aggressive counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, I've reached a point where I'm worried about running out of time.  John's offer is a sure thing, and it ensures I get my minimum target price."
