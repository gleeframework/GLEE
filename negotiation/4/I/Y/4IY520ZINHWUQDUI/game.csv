"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $125?  That gives you a good deal and still allows me to get a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $117.50.  It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $117.50 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $121.25?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",121.25,Alice,5,
