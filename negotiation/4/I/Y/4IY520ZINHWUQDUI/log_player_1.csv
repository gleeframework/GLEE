"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, as you mentioned you value it at $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $125?  That gives you a good deal and still allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $117.50.  It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's latest offer.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while giving me a better chance of getting a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $117.50 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $121.25?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 121.25}
