"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're putting on this product, but unfortunately $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is just too low. It's a fantastic product, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500.  This is a fair price, considering its value and my initial offer. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is the price I could get from another seller.  Let's close this deal at that price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
