"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than John's offer, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price still offers you a significant saving compared to the value you place on the product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. Although $9,800 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is a concern. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer you the product for $10,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. I'm confident we can finalize this deal and both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and we're getting closer to my desired price.  While $9,500 is still a bit lower than I would like, it's a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by rejecting his offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
