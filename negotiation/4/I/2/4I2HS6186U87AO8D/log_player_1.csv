Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,800,000? I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

 We are still significantly above John's offer, and I believe there's room to negotiate with Bob further."

While we're still above John's offer, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,750,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
