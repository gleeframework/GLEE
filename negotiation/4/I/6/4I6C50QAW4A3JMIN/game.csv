"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value you've expressed.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",12750.0,Bob,4,
