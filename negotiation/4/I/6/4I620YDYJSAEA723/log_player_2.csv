Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes my willingness to negotiate and shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm aiming to get close to my maximum budget of $12,000, but I'm leaving some room for negotiation in case Alice needs to counter."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's within my budget.  The $11,500 price is closer to Alice's offer, indicating that I'm serious about purchasing the product and willing to meet halfway. I believe this price is a fair compromise and gives Alice a reasonable incentive to accept the offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. We're halfway through the negotiations, and there's still a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm optimistic that we can find a solution that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm finally proposing my maximum budget of $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable. If Alice rejects this offer, I'm prepared to move on to John and purchase the product from him."
