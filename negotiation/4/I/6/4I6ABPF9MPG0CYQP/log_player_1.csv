Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $160. It's a great deal for something of this value."",
""product_price"": 160
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a better deal if he counters.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $160, you're ""anchoring"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he doesn't accept this price, it makes a lower counter-offer (closer to your minimum) seem more reasonable.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, so there's no risk of losing out completely if Bob declines."
