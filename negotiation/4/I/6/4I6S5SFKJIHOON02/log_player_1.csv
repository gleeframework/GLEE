{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm asking $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a higher price than $100. I'm confident I can convince Bob to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $110? This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and we are already in round 4. It is better to accept his offer now than to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $100."
