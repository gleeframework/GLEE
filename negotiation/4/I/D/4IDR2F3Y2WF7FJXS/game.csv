"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think this product is worth a premium price.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",150.0,Bob,4,
