Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $1,850,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This price still acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Even though Bob's offer is now above John's standing offer, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to our desired value."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our discussions and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,650,000 for the product. I believe this price respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

Bob's offer is strong, and it's unlikely we'll be able to push him much further without risking the deal. Accepting the $1,650,000 ensures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
