"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. How about we consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle, though. How about we discuss $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle on $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
