"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is fantastic, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  How about $850,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. How about we go back to my original offer of $950,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal? I'll include a premium warranty and a personalized setup service. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
