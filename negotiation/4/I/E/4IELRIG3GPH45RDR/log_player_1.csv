Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Show Confidence:**  A strong opening offer can signal that you believe in the value of your product.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a strong alternative buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum price, which gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. There's room for negotiation to see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, the price I have in mind is closer to $1,800,000. This reflects the true worth of the product and its potential for your business.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're coming down from our initial high offer but not drastically. This signals some flexibility while still aiming for a price above Bob's valuation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's benefits specifically tailored to Bob's needs to justify the higher price point. 
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will help determine how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and if he's willing to move closer to your range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,600,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding the Alternative:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now higher than what John is offering ($1,500,000).  
* **Strong Profit:** This price still represents a significant profit for you, exceeding your minimum by $100,000. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or you having to settle for a lower amount.  It's often better to secure a good deal than risk losing it altogether."
