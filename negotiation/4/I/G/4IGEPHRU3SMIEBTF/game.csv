"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
