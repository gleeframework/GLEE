"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and to make this a win-win, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This offer stands for 24 hours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Here's how to reason through this:

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,150,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
* **John's Price:** $1,200,000

Alice's offer is less than both your maximum price and what John is offering. You save money by accepting her offer.

**Answer:** {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
