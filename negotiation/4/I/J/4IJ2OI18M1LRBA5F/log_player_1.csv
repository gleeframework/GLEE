Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000.  This gives you a significant advantage while still allowing me to get a good return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $1,050,000 allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher price than John's offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000) positions the offer as advantageous for him.
* **""Fair"" Language:**  Using the word ""fair"" implies flexibility,  but also establishes a baseline expectation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** The message invites Bob to engage and potentially negotiate further. 
* **Plan B:**  Having John's offer as a backup ensures I won't settle for less than $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you mentioned, and it allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my initial offer, especially since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and I believe I can likely get a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always fall back on John's offer.

**Next steps:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, keeping in mind that I need to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and securing a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll accept $1,000,000 for it. This price is fair to both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Offering $1,000,000 shows flexibility, acknowledges Bob's position, and potentially gets us closer to a deal.
* **""Fair"" Language:**  Reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Speed:**  Mentioning ""closing this deal quickly""  adds a sense of urgency and may encourage Bob to accept. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a solid fallback position."
