Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is still a significant savings for Bob compared to his perceived value of $10,000, making it an attractive offer.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays associated with finding another buyer (even though John is lined up). 

By starting with a strong but reasonable offer, you increase the likelihood of a quick and profitable sale."
