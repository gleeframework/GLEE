"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet me at a fair price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and land at $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm going to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for what the product has to offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you said that last offer was final, and I respect that.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is the best I can do.  If you're willing to reconsider, I'm ready to close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're being sincere about your offer, but I've already told you that $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm going to offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my last chance to make a deal with you, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
