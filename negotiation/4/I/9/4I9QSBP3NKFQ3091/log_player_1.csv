"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This should encourage Bob to negotiate and potentially reach a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to offer $10,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's well below the value you placed on the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
 
I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I've lowered my offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe $11,000 is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I have 6 rounds left and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. How about we settle at $10,900?  This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10900}
``` 

I'm still holding firm on a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to his price. I believe this will encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $10,900 is still a little higher than what I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,800? This is a fair price, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still have time to negotiate. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a price closer to my goal. I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,800 is still a little lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.  Let's settle at $10,850. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10850}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to get a price as close to my minimum as possible. I'm hopeful that this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to make a final counteroffer in the next round if needed."
