"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to secure a good deal. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking of offering $90 for the product. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $105. This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking of offering $95 for the product. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100, which is my absolute minimum. This allows me to sell the product and still make a profit. I hope you understand."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $100 is your minimum, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $97.50 for the product. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to $100, I've already had several rounds of negotiations and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and losing time, especially with John waiting to buy at my minimum price. I'm going to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
