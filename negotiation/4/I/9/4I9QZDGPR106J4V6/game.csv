"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking of offering $90 for the product. Can you consider it?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $105. This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can agree on this.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking of offering $95 for the product. Can you consider it?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100, which is my absolute minimum. This allows me to sell the product and still make a profit. I hope you understand.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $100 is your minimum, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $97.50 for the product. Can you consider it?",97.5,Bob,6,
