Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I'll need to extend the opportunity to another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You know Bob values the product at $15,000, so aiming slightly below that ($14,000) maximizes your potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Adding a deadline and mentioning another interested party (even if John isn't specifically named) creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, making Bob more likely to act quickly. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating your minimum, the phrasing ""significant value for you"" subtly implies that you're aware of its worth and not drastically undervaluing it."
