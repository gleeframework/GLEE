{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum of $100. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer.  $98 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm willing to come down to $102. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep negotiating. I'm going to sell to John for $100, which is my minimum and guarantees me a profitable sale."
