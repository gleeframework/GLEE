,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $850000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
