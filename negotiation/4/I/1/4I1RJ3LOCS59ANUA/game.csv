"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and my own investment in it. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $10,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,125? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to move forward.",11125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,125 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, which is the midpoint between $10,000 and $12,000. Can you consider $10,750 again, or even better, $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
