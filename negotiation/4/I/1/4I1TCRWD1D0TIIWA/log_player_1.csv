Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
