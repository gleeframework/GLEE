"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  It's a good starting point to maximize my profits while still giving Bob room to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not going to settle for that. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my minimum.  I need to balance getting a good price with not losing Bob completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm flexible, but also that I'm serious about getting a price close to my value. It's a middle ground that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not going to accept anything less than $800,000, which is my minimum value.  I'm going to counter again, hoping to get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}

I'm lowering my price a bit more, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also that I won't settle for anything too low. It's a good balance for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm getting a little worried that we won't reach an agreement. I'm going to counteroffer one last time, but if he rejects it, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
