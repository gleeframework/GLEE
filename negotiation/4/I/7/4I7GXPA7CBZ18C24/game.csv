"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'll offer you the product for $102.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",102.5,Alice,5,
