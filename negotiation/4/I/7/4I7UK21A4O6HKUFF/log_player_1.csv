Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy is meant to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  The initial high price sets a strong baseline for the negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His reaction to this offer will give me insights into how aggressively he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for compromise:** I'm willing to lower the price if necessary, but I'm not giving away my profit margin right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer matches his perceived value, I am aiming for a higher profit. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired $1,750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, acknowledging that Bob's offer is a bit low.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a profit. It's a strong middle ground and gives Bob some incentive to come up on his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still not high enough.  I believe I can secure a better deal by making a final counteroffer. I'm still confident I can get a price that's closer to my desired $1,750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final counteroffer. I'm lowering my price again to show I'm willing to compromise.  $1,600,000 is a significant profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this final offer. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to meet my price, and I've already made multiple concessions.  It's clear that we're not going to come to an agreement. Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees me a sale and a decent return, even if it's not the ideal outcome."
