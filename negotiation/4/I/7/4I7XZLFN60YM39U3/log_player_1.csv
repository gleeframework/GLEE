"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your company. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high offer ($2,000,000) gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob creates a positive impression and may encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** My offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving ample space for negotiation throughout the next rounds.

**Important Note:** While I'm starting with a high offer, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if necessary. This provides a solid fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my company. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,200,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $800,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a more favorable price. 
* **Staying committed to my value:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean a significant loss for me. I am determined to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum threshold. I will need to assess how determined Bob is to acquire the product and adjust my offer accordingly."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the value I'm placing on this unique opportunity for your company. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm lowering my initial offer from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""unique opportunity"" the product presents for Bob's company, subtly reminding him of its worth. 
* **Compromise & Appeal:** The offer strikes a balance between my minimum acceptable value and Bob's potential.  I'm proposing a ""solution that works for both of us,"" which might encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

By moving closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, I'm showing willingness to compromise. However, I'm still significantly above his offer and my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,750,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,450,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would mean a financial loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, providing enough time for further negotiation and potentially securing a higher price.
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and push for a price closer to my desired value. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price just below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  This approach will demonstrate my commitment while still leaving room for a compromise. I will also consider the possibility of selling to John if Bob remains stubborn."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm ready to make a final compromise. $1,450,000 is still below the true value of this product, but I'm willing to go down to $1,490,000.  This is my best offer, and it reflects the importance I place on this deal.  Let's close this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1490000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm signaling that this is my final offer, adding urgency to the negotiation. 
* **Near Minimum:** The price is just below my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000), showing my commitment to the deal while still securing a decent profit.
* **Emphasis on Importance:** I'm reminding Bob of the ""importance"" of the deal, implying potential future benefits if he accepts.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move that aims to:

1. **Push for a Higher Price:** I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum acceptable value as possible. 
2. **Create Urgency:** By stating it's my ""best offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept.
3. **Prepare for a Potential Deal with John:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000 to secure a guaranteed sale and minimize my potential loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's final offer of $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are approaching the final rounds of negotiation, and there is a risk of reaching an impasse with Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the potential risk of losing the deal entirely.

**Strategic Decision:**

Given the circumstances, it's in my best interest to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John. While I'd prefer to negotiate with Bob for a higher price, the risk of not closing the deal with him outweighs the potential for a small additional profit."
