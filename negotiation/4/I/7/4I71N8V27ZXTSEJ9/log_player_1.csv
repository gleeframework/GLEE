"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is still below my minimum value, but I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be careful about how much I compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise, considering we're down to the wire.  I'm also factoring in the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to settle with John for the same price."
