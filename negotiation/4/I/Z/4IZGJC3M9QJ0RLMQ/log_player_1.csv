Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate (if he wants) while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might make Bob hesitant or feel like he's being overcharged. This price point makes it clear Alice is serious about selling while still offering a good deal to Bob.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, with John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000, Alice is guaranteed a minimum profit. This strategy aims to maximize potential gains."
