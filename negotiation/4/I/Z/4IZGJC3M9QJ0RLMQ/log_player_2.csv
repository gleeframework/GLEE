"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $1,400,000 is cheaper than $1,500,000.
* **But you can still do better:** You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice. This means there is room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Rejecting the offer gives you leverage:** By rejecting, you show Alice you are serious about getting a better deal and might be willing to walk away. This increases your chances of getting a lower price in a counteroffer or getting Alice to agree to your proposed price."
