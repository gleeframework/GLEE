"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's a good deal for her, it's not within my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to buy the product from you, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit lower before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is still a stretch for my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This price allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only willing to come down $75,000 from her previous offer.  At this point, I'm not sure we'll be able to reach an agreement that works for both of us. I'm getting closer to my limit, and it's taking too long to close the deal. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
