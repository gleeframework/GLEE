"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be able to afford it.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $7,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,7,
