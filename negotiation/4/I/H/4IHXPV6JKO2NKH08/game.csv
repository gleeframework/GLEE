"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This would allow both of us to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more to me than $1,050,000. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
