"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $750,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you think it's a great deal. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
