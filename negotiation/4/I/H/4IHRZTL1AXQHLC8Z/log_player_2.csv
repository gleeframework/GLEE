You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal than $900,000, especially since you know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice."

I'm offering Alice $750,000. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and still leaves room for further negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point that acknowledges her value for the product while also reflecting my budget."

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is closer to my target but still above my ideal price. I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate a bit further.  It's worth trying to squeeze out a better deal before resorting to John."

I'm going to offer Alice $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I'm willing to pay. If she rejects it, I'll go with John's offer."
