"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm ending with a question to encourage dialogue and gauge Bob's initial reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for a better deal. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  The negotiation is still in its early stages. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore further options and try to close the deal at a higher price. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  Selling to John immediately would be a safe option, but it would leave money on the table. I'm willing to take a calculated risk and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good starting point for a final agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still have some room to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth significantly more to him than the price I'm offering.
* **Setting the stage for a deal:** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation open and encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still above the $800,000 I would get from John.
* **Room for improvement:**  There are still two rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:** While John is a safe option, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'm willing to take the risk and keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $887,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** This strategy has been successful so far, and it shows I'm flexible and willing to compromise. 
* **Positioning for finality:**  By suggesting a ""fair price"" and encouraging the deal to happen, I'm subtly suggesting that this is my final offer.
* **Limited options left:** With only five rounds remaining, the pressure is on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal."
