Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **High Anchor:** This initial price sets a strong anchor, making a slightly lower counter-offer from Bob still very profitable for me.
* **Alternative Option:** I have the security of John's offer ($800,000) if Bob rejects my proposal, so I can afford to aim high."
