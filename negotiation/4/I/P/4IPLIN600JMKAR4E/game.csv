"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $90. Can we meet in the middle again?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $90 is really pushing it, but I can go down to $100, my absolute lowest. It's a great deal!",100.0,Alice,5,
