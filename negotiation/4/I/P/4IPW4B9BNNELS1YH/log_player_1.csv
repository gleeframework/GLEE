Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as you've said it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get from this deal.  I'm also leaving the door open for counteroffers and negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:**  I'm starting with a high offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me bargaining power and prevents me from accepting a low offer out of desperation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.  It's also far below the price I initially offered ($12,000). Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum price. While I want to negotiate a price that satisfies both of us, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product.  Selling to John is always an option if I cannot reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $5,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering your stated value of $8,000.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value and lower than my initial offer. This shows willingness to compromise while protecting my interests.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer but firmly state it's too low. I then offer a counterproposal that is more appealing while maintaining a sense of fairness. I also invite further negotiation by suggesting we ""meet in the middle."" 

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a significant margin.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing the $10,000 counteroffer as a fair price, highlighting the fact that it's above his perceived value.
* **Open Communication:**  My message encourages further negotiation, keeping the conversation open to reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $6,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $6,500 is an improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and much lower than my current offer of $10,000.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I have a backup buyer in John.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate with him, aiming for a price closer to my $10,000 offer.  I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and the fairness of my counteroffers.  If the negotiation fails, I am prepared to sell the product to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $6,500 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $9,000. This is a fair price that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable value for my product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still lower than my previous offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but reiterating that it's too low.  I'm then proposing a compromise price that is closer to the middle ground. I also encourage further discussion and emphasize the fairness of my offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by further reducing my price. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing the $9,000 counteroffer as a fair price, emphasizing the compromise. 
* **Encouraging Negotiation:**  My message aims to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer.  

I'm hoping that Bob will find this offer more appealing and agree to a deal. If he doesn't, I'm still prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,500? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $7,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and considerably less than the value I believe the product holds. While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that is so far below my expectations.  I've already indicated my willingness to compromise, and Bob's insistence on a much lower price shows that we are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable agreement.

**Strategy:**

It's time to move on and secure the best possible outcome. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000, I will sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob.  This ensures I get a fair price and avoids the risk of accepting a price that is too low."
