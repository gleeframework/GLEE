Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $19,000,  let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Gauging Bob's interest:** The message is framed positively but doesn't reveal how much the product is worth to you. This lets you gauge Bob's interest level by his reaction to the price. 
* **Potential for profit maximization:** If Bob accepts the $19,000 price, you maximize your profit. If he rejects it, you can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no time constraints or penalties for the product not selling to Bob immediately. If time is a factor, you might adjust your strategy to be more aggressive and potentially lower your initial asking price."
