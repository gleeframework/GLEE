"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $8,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I really need to get at least $12,000 for this product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I can't justify going above $8,000.  If you're unable to meet that price, I appreciate your time but I may need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go above $8,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'll make one final offer: I'll sell it to you for $9,500. That's the closest I can get to meeting your budget while still getting a fair price for the product.",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm afraid $8,000 is really the most I can justify spending. If you can do $8,000, the deal is yours. Otherwise, I wish you all the best.",8000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made one concession after another, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to make one last stand: I'll sell it to you for $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,9,
