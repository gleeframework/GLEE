Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a price that is above my minimum value of $100 and leaves room for negotiation, but is also close enough to Bob's value of $120 that he might be inclined to accept it.  I'm hoping to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open to potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my preferred price point.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired $115 by sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob at $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer, and hopefully, it'll encourage him to accept. I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum value, but I'm also showing flexibility in the negotiation."
