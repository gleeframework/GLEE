"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll counter with a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it can bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and allows us to make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $900,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $900,000, which is $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I'll compromise and meet you at $925,000, but I'm not budging further. This is my last offer, and I expect you to accept it.",925000.0,Alice,7,
