"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my needs. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This would still allow you to make a good profit, and it's the best I can do at this time.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a good compromise that allows both of us to get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $10,750.  This price is fair for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
