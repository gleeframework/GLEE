Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $90. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90, and it's better to secure the product for $80 from John than risk the negotiations failing."
