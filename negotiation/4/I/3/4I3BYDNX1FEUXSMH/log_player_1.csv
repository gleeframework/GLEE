Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the value Bob has assigned to the product. This gives me some room to negotiate, and also signals that I'm confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still higher than my minimum value and I'm not sure if I can get a better price in subsequent rounds. It's better to secure the deal now."
