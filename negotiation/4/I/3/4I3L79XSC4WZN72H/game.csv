"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you and higher than my minimum acceptable price. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $950,000? That would still be a significant savings for you compared to its value to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",950000.0,Alice,3,
