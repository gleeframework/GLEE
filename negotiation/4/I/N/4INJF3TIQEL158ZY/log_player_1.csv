Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $120 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount to $175, but I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is offering my minimum price, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is also willing to pay that price. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, especially since I have a limited number of rounds."
