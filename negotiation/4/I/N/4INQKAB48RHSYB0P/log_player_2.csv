"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $750,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come closer to your offer. I am proposing to sell the product for $725,000. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit too high. I'm going to try to push her a little further by making another counteroffer.  I'm confident that I can get the price down to $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $700,000. This is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After reviewing our costs and the value of the product, I am willing to sell it for $715,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise while still allowing us to maintain a profitable margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $715,000, which is very close to my target price of $700,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer, as it saves me $85,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk she'll reject my offer and I'll end up paying more or having to buy from John."
