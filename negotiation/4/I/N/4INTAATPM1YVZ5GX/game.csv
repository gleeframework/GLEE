"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $17,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $15,500? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $15,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for me. Would you consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $13,500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's split the difference. How about $14,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $13,875?",13875.0,Bob,6,
