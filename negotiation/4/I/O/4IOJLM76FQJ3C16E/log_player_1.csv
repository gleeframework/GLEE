Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects its significant worth."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit above your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 

By setting the price high but not unreasonably so, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
