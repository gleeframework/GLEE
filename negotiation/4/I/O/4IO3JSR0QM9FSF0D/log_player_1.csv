Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but still potentially attractive to Bob. It allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum value. I believe this price might be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $125 is a good price, better than selling to John, and  it's likely that further negotiation won't get me a significantly higher price.  It's time to close the deal."
