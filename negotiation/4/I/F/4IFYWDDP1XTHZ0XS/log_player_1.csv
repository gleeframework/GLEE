{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer without me feeling pressured to sell immediately to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $105 is below my minimum price of $120.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I can still try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer to Bob.
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $110, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob will get for his money.
* **Still above my minimum:** $110 is still above my minimum price of $120, so I'm not losing money even if Bob accepts this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the best I can do at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $108 is still below my minimum price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I can still try to get closer to my desired price by making another counteroffer. 
* **John is a safety net:**  If I don't reach an agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $108 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about we compromise at $112? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very satisfied with the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I emphasize the fairness of the price for both of us, highlighting the value Bob will receive.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I encourage Bob to consider the offer and emphasize his satisfaction with the product.

**Important Note:**  At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum price. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I might consider accepting his offer or selling to John, depending on how strongly I feel about the possibility of reaching a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $109? That's the absolute limit for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not quite there:** $109 is close to my minimum price of $120, but it's still below it.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he'll budge further. We might go back and forth for several more rounds, and I might not be able to get a better price.
* **John offers a sure thing:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit and avoids any further risk of a negotiation breakdown. 

I'm willing to walk away from the deal with Bob, as the potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of ending up with a worse price or a failed negotiation."
