"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this truly unique product.  Its value is undeniable, and I believe it would be a highly profitable asset for you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, but I need to see a more reasonable price to proceed.  Let's find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations in terms of returns. To move us closer, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to find a mutually agreeable outcome.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the gesture, but $1,600,000 is still above my target.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're hitting a bit of an impasse. I value your time and I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,300,000. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
