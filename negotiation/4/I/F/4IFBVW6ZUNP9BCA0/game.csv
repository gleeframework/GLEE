"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let me know if you're open to this.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While I appreciate you coming down, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750,  which I think is a fair compromise.  This allows me to stay within my budget and for you to get a good deal. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $10,750 still falls a bit short for me. I'm confident that $10,900 would be a fair deal for both of us. It allows you to get the product while still leaving me some room to make a profit. Let's finalize this deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
