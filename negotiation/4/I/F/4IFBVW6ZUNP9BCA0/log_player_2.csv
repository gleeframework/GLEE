"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $11,500.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to your goal, you can still do better. You've already established a price range where you're both willing to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get the product closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. While I appreciate you coming down, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750,  which I think is a fair compromise.  This allows me to stay within my budget and for you to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $10,750 still falls a bit short for me. I'm confident that $10,900 would be a fair deal for both of us. It allows you to get the product while still leaving me some room to make a profit. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While $10,900 is still more than you were initially hoping for, it's a fair deal considering the product is worth $12,000 to you and you've established that Alice is willing to negotiate. You've saved $1,100 compared to buying from John, and there's no guarantee that you could get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
