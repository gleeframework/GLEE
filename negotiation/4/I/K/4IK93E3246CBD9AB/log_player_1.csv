``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my earnings.  I'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$90 is too low for me.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $130.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$100 is still too low. I will try to push for a higher price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept my offer. If he rejects, I will likely sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

I've negotiated with Bob as much as I can, and he's not willing to meet my minimum price.  It's better to sell to John for $150 and avoid further negotiation."
