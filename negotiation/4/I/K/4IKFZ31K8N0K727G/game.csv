"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer represents a considerable investment from my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. I'm eager to close this transaction and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
