# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.
