Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John provides a guaranteed $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, getting you closer to your $150 goal.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:**  Offering it for more than $100 (Bob's value) but less than $150 (John's guaranteed purchase) creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts."
