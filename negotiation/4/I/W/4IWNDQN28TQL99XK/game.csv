"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $102.50?",102.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $102.50 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $108?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to where I need to be.",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95, which is my absolute maximum. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
