"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $135 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly opening message helps build rapport and increases the chance of a successful negotiation.
* **Open Ended:** The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $150. It's also far lower than my initial offer of $135.  While I could accept his offer and earn some money, it's not worth the risk of settling for a much lower price when I can potentially negotiate a better deal or sell to John.  

I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to his perceived value. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer by highlighting the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm again using an open-ended question to encourage further discussion."
