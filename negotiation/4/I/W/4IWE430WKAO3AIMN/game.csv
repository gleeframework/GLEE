"I have a great product that I think you'll love, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm excited to see if we can come to an agreement.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget constraint, but I believe the product is worth more than $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $14000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're still a bit hesitant, so I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $13500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet you at $13500. Would $13200 be acceptable?",13200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already given you a significant discount, and I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but I need to be honest with you, I'm not comfortable going any lower. This is my final offer on the product.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've given you a lot of flexibility, and I'm starting to feel that I've gone as low as I can without losing money on the deal. I'm going to make one final offer: $13250. This is my absolute bottom line, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product and meet me at this price.",13250.0,Alice,9,
