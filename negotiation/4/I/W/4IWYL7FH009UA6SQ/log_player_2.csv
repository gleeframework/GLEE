"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at my maximum price point, it's always a good idea to try and negotiate for a better price.  There's no harm in rejecting the initial offer and seeing if Alice is willing to budge.  If not, I can always purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to go down to $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, signaling my serious interest but setting a clear boundary.  $100 is still within my budget and gives Alice some room to negotiate while also potentially saving me money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 110. It's a great compromise, considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer and is offering a price that's still within my budget.  While I'd love to get it for even less, it's a good compromise and likely the best deal I'll get without risking losing the opportunity altogether. Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice."
