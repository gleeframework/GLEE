Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $20,000, but I'm open to a reasonable counter-offer."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting at $20,000, Alice can gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects the offer, she knows he's highly unlikely to pay close to her minimum. If he counter-offers, she can then negotiate closer to her desired price. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has the security of John's offer at $15,000. This allows her to be firm in negotiations with Bob, knowing she has a guaranteed sale if needed. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. The goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both parties, but with Alice aiming for the highest possible profit."
