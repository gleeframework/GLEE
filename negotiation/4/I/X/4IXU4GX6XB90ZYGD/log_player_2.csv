(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way over your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

You're going to start by making a bold counteroffer.  $600,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the realm of possibility for a product you value at $800,000.  This gives you some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's moving in the right direction. You should reject it and counter again, trying to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

You're going to make another counteroffer, this time offering $700,000.  This is a smaller step than your previous offer, showing Alice you're willing to negotiate but also that you're serious about getting a good deal."
