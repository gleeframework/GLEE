"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for this product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $13,800 to make it worth my while. It's a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:** It's lower than her initial price of $14,000 and closer to Bob's counteroffer of $13,000. 
* **Buying from John is still more expensive:**  While there are still a few rounds left, accepting this offer saves $1,200 compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also the risk that Alice might increase the price or become less willing to negotiate.

Overall, accepting the offer is a smart move for Bob, balancing potential savings with the risk of losing the opportunity for a better price."
