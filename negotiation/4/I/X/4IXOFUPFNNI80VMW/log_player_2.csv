"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  I understand its worth to you is $1000000, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its value while also being fair to me.  I'm asking for $950000.  This allows for a substantial profit for you and a fair return on my investment.  Please consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better.  Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or secure a better deal from another seller. You're not obligated to buy from John, so rejecting Alice's offer doesn't mean you have to buy from him."
