Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and making it seem like a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a raw deal.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $15,000 gives me confidence to negotiate without feeling pressured to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm a bit flexible, but I'd like to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is showing interest and willing to negotiate. I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I can always go to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for a product worth so much."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm staying positive and emphasizing that I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Justification:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to help Bob see the fairness of the offer.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $10,500 is still well above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $10,000 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's a decent compromise.
* **Risk of Losing Bob:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only John's offer.
* **Time is a Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I may not be able to get a significantly higher price. 

**Conclusion:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $15,000, accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of losing him completely."
