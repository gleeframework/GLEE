Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price that is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to sell the product for less than I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair price that allows for further negotiation without compromising my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below it. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price. John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
