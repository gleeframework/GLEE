"I understand that you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm prepared to pay $8250.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?",8250.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $8250, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service package that's valued at $500. So, the total value you'll be getting is $8250 + $500 = $8750. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal.
