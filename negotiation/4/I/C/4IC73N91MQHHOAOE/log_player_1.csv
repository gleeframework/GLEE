Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $150 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $130?  That's a fair price for both of us.

While negotiating with Bob might lead to a slightly higher price than John's offer, it's unlikely Bob will go above $130. Accepting a price that low cuts into my profit margin significantly. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
