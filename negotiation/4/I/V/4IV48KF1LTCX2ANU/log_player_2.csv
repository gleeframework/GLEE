"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very valuable product I believe you would be interested in. It's not something I can disclose details about just yet, but I can assure you its worth is substantial. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity for someone who values unique and potentially high-return ventures. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no potential to save money by accepting. You can get the same product from John for the same price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best course of action. This allows you to explore other options or potentially negotiate with Alice further if you're convinced the product is truly valuable."
