"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but $12,000 is still a significant amount.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially get a lower price. You'll make a counteroffer, and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant reduction:** Offering $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $12,000. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable starting point:**  $10,000 is still within your budget, and leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Testing Alice's bottom line:** This counteroffer will gauge how much Alice is willing to drop her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is close to your ideal price.** $11,500 is significantly lower than her initial price of $12,000 and closer to your target of $10,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more savings.**  While you could try to negotiate further, it's possible that Alice will be unwilling to drop the price much more.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.

**Strategy:**  Accepting Alice's offer provides a good balance between cost savings and ensuring you get the product."
