"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $100 to both of us. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $85 for it. I believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer isn't bad, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $85 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but not insulting:**  Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($60) gives me more room to negotiate upwards. It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it shows I'm serious about buying at a lower price.
* **Polite and respectful:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Transparent about my valuation:**  By mentioning that $60 ""reflects its value to me,"" I'm subtly hinting that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest in the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $70 for the product. This still offers a good value for both of us while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a bit towards my price, which is a good sign. However,  I still think there's room for improvement. I'll continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to $60."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $65?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By proposing $65, I'm suggesting a classic negotiation tactic â€“ meeting in the middle of our current offers. This can feel like a fair solution to both parties.
* **Continuing the collaborative tone:** The phrases ""working with me"" and ""fair compromise"" reinforce a sense of partnership and encourage Alice to keep negotiating.
* **Strategic positioning:**  This counter-offer keeps me firmly in the bargaining zone, and Alice is more likely to accept a smaller price decrease than a larger one."
