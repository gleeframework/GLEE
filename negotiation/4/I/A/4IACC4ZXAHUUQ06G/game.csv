"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $800,000 for it. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your perspective, the $800,000 offer is significantly below its true worth and potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a number that's closer to reflecting its value. How about we meet halfway and consider $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I cannot exceed $800,000 for the product. Let's stick to that figure.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  It seems like we might be stuck at an impasse. I value your time and don't want to drag this out unnecessarily.  To be completely frank, I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000.  If you can meet that, the deal is yours.  Otherwise, I might have to consider my other option.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
