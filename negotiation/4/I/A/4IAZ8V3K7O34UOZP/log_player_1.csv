Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle – how about $1,100,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we split the difference again and settle on $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $975,000 is a significant sum, Bob's offer is still increasing at a good pace.  There's room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal – I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to signal that I'm firm on this price while still leaving room for Bob to counter if he's truly willing to go higher.  The slight concession shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  While I appreciate your final offer, I have a firm budget in mind.  To be completely upfront, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now met our ideal price point.  While we could push for a slightly higher amount, his language suggests he's firm on this being his upper limit.  Accepting now secures a $200,000 profit over our alternative and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
