Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10000. I believe it's a fair deal and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.,14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is still a good deal for you as it's more than what it's worth to you, and it's within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13000. This is still a good deal for you, considering its worth to you is $10000, and it's closer to my original price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While $13000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, as it's above what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12800. This is still a good deal for you, considering its worth to you is $10000, and it's getting closer to my original price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12800.0,Alice,5,
