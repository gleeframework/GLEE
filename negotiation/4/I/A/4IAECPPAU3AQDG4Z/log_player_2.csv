Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I've been very clear about the product's value to me. I offered you a significant compromise at $1,425,000, and I'm standing by that price. If you're not willing to move closer to that number, I'm afraid we're at an impasse.
