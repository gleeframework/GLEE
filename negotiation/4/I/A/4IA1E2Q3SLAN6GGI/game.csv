"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a little less. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to invest less, but I'm still confident in the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $825,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to both close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
