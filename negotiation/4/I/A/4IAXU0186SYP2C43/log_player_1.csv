Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage.  Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Aiming for More:** While you could start at $15,000 and guarantee a sale, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more.  $19,000 gives you a potential profit even after some negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message aims to subtly justify the high price by focusing on the product's value, hoping to influence Bob's perception. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk.  If Bob is turned off by the high initial price, he might refuse to negotiate altogether. However, the potential reward of a higher sale price makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
