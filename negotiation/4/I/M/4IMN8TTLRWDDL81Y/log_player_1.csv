"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident in the value of my product and want to maximize my profit.  I'm also aware of the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000, which gives me a baseline for evaluating Bob's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,100,000, which is still higher than Bob's last offer but a significant concession. This shows I'm willing to compromise while maintaining my profit margin. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can negotiate a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm reducing my price again to $950,000.  This is a considerable compromise but still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but that I won't give it away cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and it's unlikely that we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit than Bob's current offer, and it's more efficient than continuing to negotiate."
