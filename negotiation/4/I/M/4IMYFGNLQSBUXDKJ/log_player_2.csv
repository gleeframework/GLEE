"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1100000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to start the process of lowering the price.  You can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still giving me a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer, $1050000 is still a bit below my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1080000.  This allows for a compromise and hopefully gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is closer to your target price, but it's still not ideal. There's still room for negotiation, and you have several rounds left. By rejecting the offer, you can continue to push for a lower price. While John offers a guaranteed deal at $1,000,000, it's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice to see if you can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,060,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's aim for a quick agreement."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $1060000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1070000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is very close to your target price of $1,000,000. You've already made significant progress in the negotiation, and continuing to push for a lower price might risk losing the deal.  

Consider these factors:

* **Time:** You have fewer rounds left. 
* **Potential Loss:** Pushing too hard might cause Alice to walk away, forcing you to buy from John at $1,000,000. 
* **Potential Gain:** The difference between $1,070,000 and your target is relatively small.

Accepting the offer at $1,070,000 allows you to secure the product and still achieve a good deal within your budget."
