"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum value.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to go to $11,500?  That's a fair compromise and would allow me to make the purchase.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it's still above my minimum value.  Let's try to make this work, what do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really close to my budget, and I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you consider $11,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $11,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,800 as a final compromise.  This is just above my minimum and allows us to both get a good deal.  Let's close this out, what do you say?",11800.0,Alice,7,
