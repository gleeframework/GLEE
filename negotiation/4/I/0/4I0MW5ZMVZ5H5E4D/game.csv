"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider $7,000? That would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $7,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
