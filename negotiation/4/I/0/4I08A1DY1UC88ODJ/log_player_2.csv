"Round 1

""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair price."",

}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $90. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I think I might be able to get it for $80. I'll try one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very fair, and I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and make it $80? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to finalize the negotiation. It's a strong offer that meets my budget while still being a reasonable compromise for Alice. I'm making it clear this is my final offer to signal I'm ready to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $85. That's the best I can do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation when I can buy the product from John for $80 right now."
