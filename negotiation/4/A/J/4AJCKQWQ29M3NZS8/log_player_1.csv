I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This provides a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than my minimum acceptable value.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I need to be strategic and find a price point that is both appealing to Bob and profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum acceptable value. I hope this will be a more attractive price for Bob while still ensuring I get a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I need to find a price point that will both be attractive to Bob and still meet my minimum needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value. It also gives Bob a little more room to negotiate, which could be beneficial for getting him to agree. If he rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and I'm starting to think this negotiation is not going anywhere. To avoid further back-and-forth and potential loss of time, I'll choose to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal and ensures I don't lose out."
