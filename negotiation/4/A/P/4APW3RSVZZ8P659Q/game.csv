"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be happy to purchase it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your valuation of the product and to facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction, I propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $85.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
