# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. We believe this is a fair price considering its value, and we're confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. This indicates there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your valuation of the product and to facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction, I propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $90 is still a bit high. There's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the opportunity to potentially get a lower price."
