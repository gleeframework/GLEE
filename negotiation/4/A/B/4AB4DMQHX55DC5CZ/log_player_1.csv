Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better outcome.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob. Setting the price at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation but keeps it significantly above his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, starting with a strong initial offer gives you the best chance to negotiate down to a price that still nets you a significant profit."
