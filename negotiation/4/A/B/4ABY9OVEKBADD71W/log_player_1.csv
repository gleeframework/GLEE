"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's not enough to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm confident I can secure a better price, especially since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I want to see if I can get closer to $900,000, but I'm also keeping an eye on the clock. If this doesn't work out, I'm prepared to sell to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $860,000 is a decent offer, I still have a few rounds to try and get closer to $900,000. If this doesn't work, I'll be prepared to sell to John, but I'm not ready to give up just yet."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite at your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $865,000. This is a small compromise on my part, and I hope it's enough to seal the deal.  We're both getting close to where we need to be. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 865000}

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'm still hopeful of getting closer to $900,000 with Bob, we're down to the wire and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I can't afford to gamble any further."
