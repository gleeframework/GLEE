"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for negotiation.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while leaving room for both of us to be satisfied.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm also running out of time.  Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm still not quite at your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $865,000. This is a small compromise on my part, and I hope it's enough to seal the deal.  We're both getting close to where we need to be. Let's try to make this work.",865000.0,Alice,7,
