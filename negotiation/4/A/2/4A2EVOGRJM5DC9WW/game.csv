"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable item. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that."
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1350000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.",1350000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the item.",1200000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $1300000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far."
"I'm willing to compromise further, Bob. I'm thinking that $1300000 is a fair price, but I can see that you're still not comfortable with it. I'm willing to come down to $1280000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a reasonable price considering the product's value.",1280000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1280000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the item and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, but it will be a tough one for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I need you to meet me halfway on the next concession. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to consider other options."
"I'm willing to make a serious concession, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I need you to meet me halfway on the next concession. If you're willing to meet me at $1300000, I'll throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm counting on your response.",1300000.0,Alice,7,,
