"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. Since you have 10 rounds, there's ample opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating my intent to negotiate a lower price. $900,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and is still a profitable deal for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still higher than my desired price point. While it's a step in the right direction, I believe there's still room for further negotiation. I'll reject the offer and counter again with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price considering your desired selling price and the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with a lower price, but increasing it slightly from the previous round. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm price point.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will prompt Alice to move closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $1,050,000 is still too high. Since we have 5 more rounds, I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired selling price. I believe we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant move closer to Alice's last offer, showing my willingness to compromise. By offering $1,000,000, I'm demonstrating my seriousness about closing the deal while still staying within my budget. I believe this offer is attractive enough to Alice, considering her desired selling price, to entice her to accept."
