"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is truly unique and valuable, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
