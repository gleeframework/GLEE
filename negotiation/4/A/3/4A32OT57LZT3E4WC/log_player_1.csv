It's better to accept Bob's offer at $9,500 than to sell to John for $8,000. Although it's less than the previous counteroffer, it's still a significant profit. Continuing the negotiation might result in a lower price or a longer negotiation process, and there's no guarantee Bob will accept a higher offer."
