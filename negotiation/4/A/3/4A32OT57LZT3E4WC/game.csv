"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I have to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my desired price.  $9,800 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This offer allows you to still purchase the product at a significantly discounted price compared to its value to you. Let's try to close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,500? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
