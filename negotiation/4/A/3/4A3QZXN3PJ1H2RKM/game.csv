"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $85 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $88.75?  That's a good price for both of us.",88.75,Bob,4,
