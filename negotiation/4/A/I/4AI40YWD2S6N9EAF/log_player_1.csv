Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $65 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 82.50}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting very close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk ending up with less than $120. John is a guaranteed sale, and I'm confident I can find another buyer for this product in the future."
