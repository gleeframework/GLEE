"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal, as you know the value to you is $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other buyers lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the door to getting a better price, saving you $100,000."
