"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $105. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
