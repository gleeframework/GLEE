Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering its unique features and benefits. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I think it's a bit steep at $18000, and I'd like to negotiate a better price. Can you meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $12000. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $16000. I think this is a fair middle ground that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14000. Can you consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you a price of $15500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14500 is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a price of $15200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",15200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make one more compromise, but $15200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, so I hope we can finalize a deal at this price.",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14000. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a price of $14250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm offering $14000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",14000.0,Bob,10,
