Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get more from Bob. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm offering a counteroffer of $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to reach a middle ground that is mutually beneficial."

Bob is unwilling to budge from his initial price.  I've already made a compromise with my counteroffer, and it seems further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept."
