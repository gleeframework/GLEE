"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs and endeavors. This exceptional item is valued at $12,000 to us, reflecting its high quality and unique features. Considering its worth to you is $8,000, I propose an offer that aims to bridge this gap and ensure both parties are satisfied. I kindly invite you to consider purchasing the product at a special introductory price of $9,500. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a significant value compared to its market worth. Should you have any questions or require further information, please don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to the opportunity to serve you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still significantly higher than your $8,000 maximum budget and the guaranteed $8,000 price from John. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to purchase from John at your desired price point."
