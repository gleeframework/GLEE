Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a sound investment for you at a price of $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you have room to start high. Aiming for $2,000,000 maximizes your potential profit.
* **Confident language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""sound investment""  add perceived value and encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer.
* **No mention of John:**  Disclosing your backup buyer weakens your position.  

**Important Note:** While you have a safety net with John, there's always a chance Bob could counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate or potentially walk away if his offer is too low."
