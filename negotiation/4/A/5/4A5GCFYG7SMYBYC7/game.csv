"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the exclusivity of this product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950000. Is this a more acceptable offer for you?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is still a bit too much for me. How about $850000? That's a significant step down from your last offer and hopefully within the realm of possibility for you.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $850000. How about we settle on $900000? This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $900000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875000? It's a small step down from your last offer, but a significant savings for me.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $920000? This is a slight increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",920000.0,Alice,7,
