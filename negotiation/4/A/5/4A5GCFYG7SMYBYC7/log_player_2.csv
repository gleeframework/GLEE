{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the exclusivity of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1200000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950000. Is this a more acceptable offer for you?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit too much for me. How about $850,000? That's a significant step down from your last offer and hopefully within the realm of possibility for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $850000. How about we settle on $900000? This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, you're still above your desired budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a little lower, but be prepared to buy from John if the price doesn't come down more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000? It's a small step down from your last offer, but a significant savings for me."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $920000? This is a slight increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but the price is still above your limit. At this point, it's best to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000.  You've made a good effort to negotiate with Alice, but you don't want to risk going over your budget."
