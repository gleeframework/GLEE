{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a chance you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price, aiming for a price that's close to my maximum budget. This should signal that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to pay the asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm not yet ready to pay that much and still have room for negotiation.  I want to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,000,000.  This is my maximum budget, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me there. If she doesn't, I can always go to John and buy the product for the same price."
