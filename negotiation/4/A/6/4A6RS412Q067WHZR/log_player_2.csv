Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $900,000, which is less than John's price of $1,000,000.
* **The product is worth more to Bob:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so even with Alice's offer, he's still getting a good deal. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $100,000 compared to buying from John."
