"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest!  $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  How about we split the difference at $90?  That way we both get a good deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $90 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that price.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $87.50 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about $89?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and I'm confident we can make this work.",89.0,Alice,5,
