"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a compromise for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a bit more flexibility, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I can offer you the product for $13,250. This is still a great price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get from it.",13250.0,Alice,5,
