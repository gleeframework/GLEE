"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $10,000, and I believe I can get a better price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 

I'm offering Bob a price of $12,000.  This is still below my initial offer of $15,000, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to raise his price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $11,000. This is a compromise, showing him I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum value for the product. It's better to secure the deal now than to risk losing the sale to Bob in the remaining rounds or having to accept John's offer of $10,000."
