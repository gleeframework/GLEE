"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. To move this forward, I could consider $1,050,000. This reflects some flexibility on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what I'm offering.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value I'll get from this product. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and desire to find common ground. I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  My final offer is $1,012,500.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential this product holds.  Let me know your decision.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to be realistic about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and propose $950,000. I think this is the maximum I can go, and I hope you can meet me halfway. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",950000.0,Bob,6,
