"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still above his budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his budget as possible. He's offering a price that's still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but leaves room for negotiation.  This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, allowing Bob to potentially get a lower price.  There's also a chance Alice will continue to lower her price as the rounds progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice he's willing to compromise.  $875,000 is still within his budget and represents a significant saving compared to Alice's current offer. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially secure a deal in the upcoming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to compromise, and Alice has shown a willingness to meet him halfway. By rejecting, Bob can potentially push for a lower price or risk buying from John if he doesn't think Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly again, demonstrating his commitment to reaching a deal. This offer is still within his budget, and it shows Alice that Bob is willing to meet her halfway. By offering $880,000, Bob aims to close the gap and potentially reach an agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's ideal price.  Accepting this offer saves him $5,000 compared to buying from John, and he's likely to be able to secure a better deal with Alice if he were to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  There is a risk that Alice will reject his next counteroffer and he might not be able to close a deal in the remaining rounds, so accepting her offer is the most logical choice at this point."
