Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500.  This is a good starting point because it's a bit more than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he isn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can get a bit more. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,200. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit and it's getting close to where I think negotiations will stall. I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially lose out on a sale entirely."
