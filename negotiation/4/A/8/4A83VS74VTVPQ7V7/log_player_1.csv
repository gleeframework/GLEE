"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm starting at a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but also demonstrating that I'm confident in the product's value. I'm curious to see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is more than my minimum, it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm not going to accept it just yet, but I will consider his offer when making my counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $105? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $105 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $97 is a decent offer.  It's above my minimum and John's offer, so accepting it ensures a profitable deal."
