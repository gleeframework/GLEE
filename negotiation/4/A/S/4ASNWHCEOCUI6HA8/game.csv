"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a realistic number, I can't let it go for less than $1,600,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
