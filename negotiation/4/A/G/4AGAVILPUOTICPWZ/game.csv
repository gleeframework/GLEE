"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for it. What do you say?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $6,000 is too low for me.  Could you do $11,000? I'm confident you won't find this at a better price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $7,500? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $7,500 is still quite a bit below what I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a very fair offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I could potentially do $8,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",8000.0,Bob,6,
