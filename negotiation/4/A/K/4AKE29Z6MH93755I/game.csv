"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $400,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $550,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to keep your budget under $475,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $490,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your budget. What do you think?",490000.0,Alice,7,
