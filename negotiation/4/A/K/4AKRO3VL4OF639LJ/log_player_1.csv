Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start there.  A higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and exclusivity by mentioning a public listing. This creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines.
* **Safety Net:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so even if Bob negotiates down, we're still likely to make a good profit. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. The key is to find a price that is agreeable to both parties while maximizing your profit."
