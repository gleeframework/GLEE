"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $1,350,000? This still leaves room for both of us to make a good profit. Let's find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
