"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a good profit margin. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a significant investment in your product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value it brings. Let's find a middle ground to make this work for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
