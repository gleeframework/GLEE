"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that much. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential benefits, but I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I believe $1800000 is a more realistic price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to undervalue it.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $1800000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential benefits, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1300000.
