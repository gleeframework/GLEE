"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate it, $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to think about it. Let me see... How about $110? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,5,
