"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's also worth a lot to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the value and potential of the product. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down closer to market value?  I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
