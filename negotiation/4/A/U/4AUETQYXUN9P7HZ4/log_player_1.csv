"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value I place on the product. It also gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can bridge the gap."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $975,000.  This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding out for a price closer to my original offer.  This should hopefully encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll counter with a price that is closer to my last offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $940,000. I'm slowly bringing the price down, but I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's last offer. This is a final attempt to get a good deal before I consider selling to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are down to the wire.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I don't want to risk going lower and missing out on a better price. With only two rounds left, I'm going to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John.  It's a good deal and will allow me to secure a decent profit.  I might be able to get slightly more from Bob, but it's not worth the risk of potentially getting nothing."
