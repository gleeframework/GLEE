Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to convey value and exclusivity without seeming overly aggressive.  

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between maximizing potential earnings from Bob while acknowledging the safety net of John's offer."
