# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

You can get a better deal than $9,500.  It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get Alice to come down in price."

You are still able to get a better price from Alice. While her offer of $9,000 is closer to your budget, it's still worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially continue negotiating with Alice, the offer of $9,200 is a good compromise. You are able to save $2,800 compared to buying from John, and it's not too far off your initial counteroffer.  It's likely that Alice won't go lower, so it's best to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
