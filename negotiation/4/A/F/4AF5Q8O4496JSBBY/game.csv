"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make an offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To be candid, I have another interested buyer who sees its worth more in line with $1,700,000. To avoid losing this opportunity, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This offer reflects the product's unique qualities and the value it brings. ",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. However, my other buyer, John, remains very interested at a price point closer to my initial offer.  To be completely transparent, $1,500,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a time-sensitive opportunity, and I need a decision soon.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you have another buyer interested, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
