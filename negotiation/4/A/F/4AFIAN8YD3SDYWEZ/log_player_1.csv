**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to lowball me. He's not increasing his offers substantially and is using language to make me feel pressured. It's very unlikely he'll go above $85 at this point. Taking the guaranteed $80 from John is the best option now to avoid the risk of getting even less from Bob."
