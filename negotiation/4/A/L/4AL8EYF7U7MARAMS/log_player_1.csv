"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a range that might be acceptable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for me to negotiate down if Bob rejects the initial offer.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to go down but not that far. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Having John's offer as a backup gives me the power to be firm in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable drop:**  I'm offering a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation friendly. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to remind Bob why it's worth a bit more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $87.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I believe there's still room to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  Having John's offer as a safety net gives me the flexibility to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $87.50 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $91.25?  This way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 91.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Appeal to reason:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the proposed price to make Bob feel like it's a good deal for both of us. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $91.25 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but closer to Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise! However, $91.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $90. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob seems willing to increase his offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives me the power to continue negotiating with Bob without being desperate."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're definitely getting closer to a price I can work with.  How about we meet at $92.50? It's just a little bit more than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise given the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm only increasing the price slightly, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the slightly higher price.
* **Close to agreement:**  This price is close to what I'm willing to accept while still being above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again! However, $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer $91.25. I think this is the best compromise we can reach. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $91.25 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and his offer.
* **Reaching a mutually acceptable price:** This price is close enough to what I want that I'm willing to accept it.
* **Limited time:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's better to accept a fair offer than risk losing out on a sale altogether.  
* **John's offer is still an option:**  If I were to reject Bob's offer, I could still sell to John for $120, but I'm willing to take this deal to secure a sale."
