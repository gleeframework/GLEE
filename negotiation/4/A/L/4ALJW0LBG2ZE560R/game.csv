"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, I'm thinking a price closer to $900,000 would be more reasonable.  Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. I believe that reflects a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your patience. I understand this is your final offer, but I have to stick to my budget.  Would you consider $975,000? I think this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let me know.",975000.0,Bob,6,
