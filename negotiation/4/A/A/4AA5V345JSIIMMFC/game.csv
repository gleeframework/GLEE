"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $17000. It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to stay within my price range. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $14000 is still a little below what I can accept at this point. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $15500. This gives you a great deal, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
