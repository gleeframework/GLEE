"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1500000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to the right buyer.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'd be willing to sell the product for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to the right buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1200000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum value. I'd be willing to sell the product for $1100000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
