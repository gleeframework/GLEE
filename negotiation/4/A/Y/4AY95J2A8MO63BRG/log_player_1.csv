Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate down.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  It leaves room for you to make concessions if necessary.
* **It's a clear opening:** It clearly states your intention and sets the stage for a potential negotiation. 

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profits. This offer allows you to do that while still leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Could you do $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. There's still potential to negotiate with Bob, and you can likely secure a higher price. Selling to John would guarantee you your minimum, but there's a chance you can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer shows you are willing to compromise and makes a reasonable offer that is closer to your minimum than Bob's offer.
* **Staying firm:**  While it's a concession, it is still above your minimum price point, showing Bob you're serious about your bottom line.
* **Focusing on fairness:**  The message emphasizes fairness, making the offer more appealing to Bob and promoting a collaborative tone."
