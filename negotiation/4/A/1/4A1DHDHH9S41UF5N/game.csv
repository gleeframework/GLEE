"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer the product to you for $1,250,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a reasonable margin. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and would allow us to both make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can make this work.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 is still not working for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the true value of the product, and it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
