Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but  $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price well below my $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come up to $125, which is a fair price and a good deal for me. It's close enough to her value that she's likely to accept, and it saves me $25 compared to John's offer."
