"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I need at least $135 for this to work. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $120 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $127.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that will benefit both of us.",127.5,Alice,5,
