"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $100 is significantly below my minimum, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I need at least $135 for this to work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $120 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $127.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that will benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 127.50}
