"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice wants to sell the product for a profit ($1,350,000 is more than her $1,000,000 value).
* You have a better alternative: buying from John for $1,500,000 is your absolute ceiling.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you create room to negotiate a lower price. She might be willing to go lower rather than lose the sale."
