Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation, while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to maximize my profit, selling for $500,000 is a significant loss compared to my minimum and selling to John. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit significantly higher than selling to John. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a loss of that magnitude. Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees a significant profit and ensures I don't lose money."
