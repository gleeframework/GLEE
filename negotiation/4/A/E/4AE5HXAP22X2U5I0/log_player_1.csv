"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Considering its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to gauge Bob's eagerness and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Politeness and Value Emphasis:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to make the price more palatable.
* **Open for Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob's input to encourage a collaborative negotiation process.

This strategy balances my desire for maximum profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer acknowledges the product's value, accepting $1,250,000 would mean losing out on a substantial profit margin. I believe there's still room for negotiation to bridge the gap. Selling to John at this stage would be a last resort, so I'll proceed to the next round with a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. However, I'm maintaining a firm stance above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlight Value Again:** The message reiterates the product's unique benefits to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Agreement:** By framing it as a mutually beneficial solution, I'm encouraging Bob to accept and avoid prolonging the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $1,300,000.  While this is still less than my initial target, it represents a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price. 

Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of:

* **Stalemate:** Bob might be hesitant to move further, leading to a deadlock.
* **Losing Bob:**  Pushing too hard could make Bob walk away from the deal entirely.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a strong profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
