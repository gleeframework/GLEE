"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Optimistic, but Realistic:**  $17,000 is a fair price considering Bob values the product at $10,000. It's likely he'll counteroffer, and we can work our way down from there.
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and optimistic can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, $12,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **More rounds to negotiate:** We have 9 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.
* **Potential for better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my target. 

**Next Round:** I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further. While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's significantly closer to your initial offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Profit:** $14,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to continue the conversation."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking $13,000 would be a more fair price for both of us. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my acceptable price, $13,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for better deal:** We have 6 rounds remaining, and I believe I can still secure a price closer to my target. 
* **Potential for compromise:** I'll try to find a middle ground in my next counteroffer, but I won't settle for anything less than my minimum. 

**Next Round:** I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to close this deal, how about it?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows I'm committed to finding a compromise.
* **Staying firm on minimum:** $13,500 is still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't sell below what I consider fair.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price and urging Bob to consider closing the deal. We've only got 5 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing out on this potential sale."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is the price I was thinking of from the start. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Limited time:** We're down to 4 rounds remaining, and there's a risk of continuing to negotiate and not getting a deal at all.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose out on a good deal.

I'm confident John will buy the product, and I'll make a profit on the sale.  It's time to move on and take the sure thing."
