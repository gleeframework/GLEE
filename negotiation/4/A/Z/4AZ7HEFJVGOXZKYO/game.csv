"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $900000 is a bit low for a product worth $1500000 to you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1050000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with this transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975000 is still a bit low for a product that's worth $1500000 to you. How about we meet in the middle again, this time at $1012500? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $985000 is still a bit low for a product that's worth $1500000 to you.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $992500. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",992500.0,Alice,7,,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand we're getting down to the wire.  However, $980000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. To make this a smooth and final transaction, how about we split the difference one last time at $990000?  This would allow us both to walk away happy and finalize the deal.  Let's do this.",990000.0,Alice,9,,
