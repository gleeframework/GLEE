"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I've done some research, and I believe the market price for this product is around that range. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the market price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'll give you a new price of $8250. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better price elsewhere.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $7500, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. I've really been looking forward to purchasing this product, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to making a decision, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $7500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $8000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better price elsewhere.",8000.0,Alice,5,
