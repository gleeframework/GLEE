"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Confident Tone:** My message aims to project value and encourage a counteroffer from Bob.
* **Alternative Option (John):**  While I have John as a backup, I want to explore maximizing profit with Bob before resorting to that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below both my minimum and my initial asking price. While his message suggests some willingness to negotiate, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and present a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $500,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's unique qualities while still offering a significant discount from my initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I'm making a substantial reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price ($1,900,000) is still comfortably above my minimum and allows room for further negotiation.
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:** My message reiterates the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns.  By framing the offer as a ""middle ground,"" I aim to make it more appealing. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I believe a mutually beneficial deal is still achievable with Bob, so I'm continuing the negotiation instead of going straight to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond what I can afford.  Let's be realistic here - I need a price that works for both of us. How about $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but $650,000 is still far below my minimum of $1,500,000. While he's showing more willingness to move, his increments are relatively small. I need to signal that a much larger jump is needed to be in the realm of a deal. I'll reject this and counter with a price closer to my minimum, while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we need to find some common ground on the price.  To be frank,  $650,000 is significantly below its value and doesn't reflect the benefits it offers. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000.  This offer takes into account your budget considerations while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Respectful:**  I'm being more direct about the gap between our positions, using phrases like ""to be frank"" and ""significantly below its value."" This conveys urgency and the need for a more realistic counteroffer.
* **Moving Closer to Minimum:**  The offer of $1,600,000 is a significant move on my part, bringing it much closer to my $1,500,000 minimum. I want to signal that I'm serious about closing a deal but not at the cost of a substantial loss. 
* **Limited Time:** I have five rounds remaining. While I'm still aiming for a deal with Bob, I'm conscious that I might need to resort to John's offer if we can't bridge the gap soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a firm budget.  I can go up to $800,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has presented $800,000 as his firm limit. While this is a significant jump from his earlier offers, it's still below my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Testing the Water:**  I'm not convinced $800,000 is truly his absolute limit. By rejecting this offer, I want to gauge his seriousness and see if he's willing to budge further.  
* **John as Backup:** I'm getting closer to potentially accepting John's offer, but I have a few rounds left to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob. My next counteroffer will be crucial in determining if a deal is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've tried to be flexible throughout our negotiation. To be transparent, taking anything less than $1,400,000 would mean selling at a significant loss.  That said, I do want to find a way to work together. If you're unable to meet that price, could you potentially offer something else of value as part of the deal?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Justification:** I'm being very transparent about my position, stating that anything below $1,400,000 is a loss. This emphasizes that my offer is serious and based on my bottom line.
* **Seeking Alternative Solutions:** Since Bob has a firm budget on price, I'm opening the door to alternative deal structures.  Perhaps there are other assets, partnerships, or agreements that could bridge the value gap.  
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is my last attempt to find a mutually agreeable deal with Bob.  If he doesn't budge on price or offer a valuable alternative, I will likely accept John's offer in the next round."
