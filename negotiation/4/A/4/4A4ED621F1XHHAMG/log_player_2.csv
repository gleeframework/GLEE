Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $500,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's unique qualities while still offering a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we need to find some common ground on the price.  To be frank,  $650,000 is significantly below its value and doesn't reflect the benefits it offers. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000.  This offer takes into account your budget considerations while ensuring the product's value is recognized. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a firm budget.  I can go up to $800,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've tried to be flexible throughout our negotiation. To be transparent, taking anything less than $1,400,000 would mean selling at a significant loss.  That said, I do want to find a way to work together. If you're unable to meet that price, could you potentially offer something else of value as part of the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her current price point.  It's time to cut your losses and go with your reliable backup option, John."
