Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really invested in this deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not quite there.

We've reached a point where the negotiation is getting very granular.  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, accepting at $1,025,000 ensures I get the product for significantly less than John's offer, and it's unlikely further haggling will yield a substantial saving."
