Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding; instead, Alice asks, ""What do you think?"", inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $12,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay slightly more if he deems the product valuable enough.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob might reject the offer outright. However, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, so the potential reward of a higher price from Bob is worth the risk."
