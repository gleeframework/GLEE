"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
