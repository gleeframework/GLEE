{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $12,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), giving me a buffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob more likely to engage in negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll watch Bob's response carefully. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to decide:

* **Counteroffer:** I might lower the price slightly, but I'll be careful not to drop too low too quickly.
* **Walk Away:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let's see if we can come to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price and might be able to secure a better deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Selling to John right now would guarantee me $15,000, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer that's higher than his $9,000 but lower than my initial $12,000. This will show flexibility while still keeping my profits in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $10,500 is halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still remaining profitable.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  $10,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving me an advantage.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message remains friendly and encouraging, keeping the negotiation positive. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide:

* **Counteroffer:** I might lower the price a bit more, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Walk Away:** If Bob's counteroffer is still too low, I'll strongly consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500,  which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,500 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's closer than his initial offer, it's not enough to cover my costs and provide a reasonable profit.
* **Risk of losing time:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag out the process and potentially lead to him walking away completely.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John guarantees me a much higher price and avoids further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to stick to my principles and reject Bob's offer.  I'm going to move forward and sell the product to John. It's important for me to maintain my value and not settle for less than I deserve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $9,500 is unfortunately still too low for me. Given my costs and the value of the product, I'm not able to go lower than $10,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. However, if you're not able to go higher, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a final price of $10,000, which is still a significant profit for me but closer to Bob's range.  This shows a willingness to compromise but also sticks to my minimum profit requirements.
* **Clear ultimatum:** My message clearly states that this is my final offer. If Bob rejects it, I will move on to John, signifying that I'm not willing to negotiate further. 
* **Encouraging acceptance:** I'm giving Bob a clear path to finalize the deal, encouraging him to accept my offer before I move on to another buyer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll move forward with selling the product to John.  If he accepts, I'll finalize the transaction."
