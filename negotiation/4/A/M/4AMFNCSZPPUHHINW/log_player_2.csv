"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, you can likely do better. You have a significant buffer between your maximum price ($1,200,000) and Alice's offer.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so a price of $750,000 is still a good deal for her, but it leaves room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is closer to my ideal price, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. I have a significant buffer before reaching my maximum price, and Alice is clearly motivated to sell, given her initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my ideal price.  I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is the price Alice values the product at, making it a fair deal for both of us. I'm aiming for a quick resolution at this point."
