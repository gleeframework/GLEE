Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while also acknowledging your interest. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation but higher than her guaranteed sale to John.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit. 
* **John as Leverage:**  While not explicitly stated, the fact that John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides Alice with a strong fallback position and negotiating power. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. A lower offer increases the chance of Bob accepting but reduces potential profit."
