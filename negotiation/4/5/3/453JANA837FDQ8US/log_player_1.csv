I'm starting with my absolute minimum price of $1,500,000. I know it's a high asking price, but I'm confident in the value of my product and I want to see if Bob is willing to meet my expectations. If he rejects, I have the option to sell to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, but it's closer. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000, which is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his price point. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too far below my minimum. While I'm still hoping to get as much as possible, it's clear he's not willing to meet my expectations.  I'm going to accept John's offer to sell the product for $1,500,000."
