"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is less than your $10,000 maximum, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer.  This will encourage her to offer a lower price, closer to her $8,000 value. You always have the option to buy from John for $10,000 if Alice doesn't budge."
