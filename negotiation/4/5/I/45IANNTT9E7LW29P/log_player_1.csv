"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, aiming to maximize potential profit.  However, it's also important to be realistic. If Bob rejects this offer, we'll need to adjust the price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing the price slightly from my initial offer.  This demonstrates flexibility while still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob without risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum, and we're already four rounds in.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit, while also minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
