"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While $11,500 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation to save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $11,500, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to go a bit lower to make this work for both of us?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $11,000 is a good price, especially since he can get it from John for $12,000.  Further negotiation might get him a lower price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal with Alice."
