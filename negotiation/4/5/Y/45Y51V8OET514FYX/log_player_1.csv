"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $800,000 for you, but I'm looking for a price closer to its true worth. My initial offer is $2,000,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high offer, significantly above Bob's valuation. This sets the negotiation starting point in my favor.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the product's worth to Bob, but also emphasize that it's worth more to me. This subtly positions me as having the stronger negotiating position.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm not completely rigid, expressing a willingness to find a ""mutually beneficial"" agreement, which suggests flexibility. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a higher starting price:**  This gives me more room to negotiate downwards while still making a profit. 
* **Establish a strong position:**  By starting high, I signal my confidence in the product's value and my resolve to get a good price.
* **Prepare for counteroffers:**  Knowing Bob's valuation, I expect counteroffers, and this opening maneuver allows for flexibility in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to be reasonable about the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm confident in the product's value, and I have the option to sell it to John for a much higher price. Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation is the best course of action. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I:

* **Maintain my position:**  I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum.
* **Preserve the potential for a better deal:**  Continuing negotiations allows me to potentially reach a price closer to my desired $1,500,000. 
* **Maintain the leverage of the John option:**  This rejection keeps open the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's, but lower than my initial offer. This will demonstrate flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value you see in this product and my commitment to a fair deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This price reflects the product's unique potential and provides us both with a profitable outcome. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledgement & Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's offer, showing I'm listening. My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, but still pushes for a higher price.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  I frame the proposed price as beneficial for both of us, emphasizing fairness and a ""profitable outcome.""
* **Maintain High Value:** I'm still significantly above Bob's initial offer, but lower than my original price. This keeps the negotiating leverage in my favor.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** This counteroffer aims to create a space for further negotiation, suggesting flexibility while maintaining a strong position.
* **Setting a Deadline:**  While not explicit, the ""10 rounds"" limit adds a sense of urgency that could encourage Bob to accept a higher price than he might otherwise.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  By lowering my price, I have room to accept further counteroffers without dropping below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, but I'm not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. This price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Although it's tempting to accept and secure a deal, I'm confident that I can secure a higher price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, so I'm not under pressure to accept a lower offer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I:

* **Maintain my position:**  I continue to signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum.
* **Preserve the potential for a better deal:**  Continuing negotiations allows me to potentially reach a price closer to my desired $1,500,000.
* **Keep the John option open:** This rejection keeps the possibility of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous counteroffer. This will demonstrate flexibility while maintaining a strong position."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you and the potential we both see in it, I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and it allows us both to move forward with this opportunity. Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise & Closing:** I'm acknowledging that we're getting closer and using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""closing this deal"" to create a sense of urgency.
* **Maintain Minimum:** My offer is at my absolute minimum acceptable price, signaling my commitment to securing a deal at this point.
* **Reiterate Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll receive from this investment.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer aims to close the remaining gap in the negotiation, setting the stage for a potential final agreement. 
* **Creating Urgency:** The ""closing this deal"" message subtly suggests that I might be willing to walk away if an agreement isn't reached soon.
* **Final Offer Mindset:** This counteroffer is close to my minimum, indicating that I'm less likely to make further concessions.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept or Counteroffer:** If Bob accepts this offer, the deal is closed. 
* **Final Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I have one more round to negotiate before deciding whether to sell to John. My counteroffer will likely be my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1550000. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious investment in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. With only four rounds remaining, the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price is decreasing. It's clear that we are too far apart in our valuations.  I'm not willing to risk losing a guaranteed $1,500,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible profit. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Negotiations with Bob are becoming unproductive and risky, as we're getting closer to the deadline without reaching an acceptable price.
* **Cutting Losses:**  By selling to John, I avoid further negotiation with Bob and ensure I get a good return on the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **Contacting John:** I will immediately contact John to finalize the sale for $1,500,000."
