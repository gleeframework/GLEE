``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. It also sets a positive tone and emphasizes the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm not willing to accept such a loss. While selling to John is an option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. I will counteroffer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,250. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired value. I want to see if I can push a bit further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,875? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting close, but still below my minimum price.  It's clear we're unlikely to reach an agreement.  While I would like to get a higher price, I'm not comfortable continuing to negotiate and risk getting stuck with a lower offer.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
