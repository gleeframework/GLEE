"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's make a deal!",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's finalize this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
