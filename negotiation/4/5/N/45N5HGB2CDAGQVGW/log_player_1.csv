Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it's a great deal considering its value."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations slightly higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob, offering it at $100 provides a significant saving for him while still generating a good profit for you (Alice).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have the option to slightly reduce the price, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John.

This approach aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
