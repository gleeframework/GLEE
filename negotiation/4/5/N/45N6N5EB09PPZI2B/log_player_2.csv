Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. Rejecting Alice's offer might push her to propose a lower price, getting you closer to a more favorable deal."
