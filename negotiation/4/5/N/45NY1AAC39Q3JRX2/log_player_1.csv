Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives you some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.

It's important to remember that you have the option to sell to John for $120 at any point if the negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is closer to your minimum, it's still lower than what you'd like to get.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $90, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still slightly below your desired price, it's very close to your minimum and much higher than Bob's initial offer. It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better result, and you risk losing the sale to Bob altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a decent price."
