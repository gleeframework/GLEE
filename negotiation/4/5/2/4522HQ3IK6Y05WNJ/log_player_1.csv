Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high! Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, starting with a price close to that maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's very eager to buy.
* **Consider Your Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000, so there's no need to go below that price."
