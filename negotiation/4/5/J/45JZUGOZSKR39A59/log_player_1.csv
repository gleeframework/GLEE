"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 represents the value I place on the product, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob is firm at $8,000, and further negotiation likely won't change his mind. Accepting his offer avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
