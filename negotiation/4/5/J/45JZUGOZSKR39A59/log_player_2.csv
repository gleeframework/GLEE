"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 represents the value I place on the product, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above his budget and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a lower price."
