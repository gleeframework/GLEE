**Explanation:**

* **Your maximum budget:** $12,000
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **John's price:** $12,000

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than your ideal price ($8,000).  It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a better price with her or potentially find another seller."
