"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $120 to you. I'm proposing to sell it to you for $110. I hope this price aligns with your expectations and allows me to earn a fair return for my effort and resources invested in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $110.  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $105 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. After considering our previous discussion, I am willing to adjust the price to $107. This still allows me to recover a reasonable return while remaining competitive. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $107, which is still a good deal for me (as it's below my $120 cap). Accepting this offer saves me $13 compared to buying from John."
