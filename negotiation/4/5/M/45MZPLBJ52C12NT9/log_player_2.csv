"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can do better than $1,400,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than that.
