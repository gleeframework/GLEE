"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price given the product's value to me and it leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
