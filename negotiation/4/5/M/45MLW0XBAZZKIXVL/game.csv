"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects a fair price considering my needs and the market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, reflecting its true worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
