"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, I can potentially save money by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows me to explore if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong negotiating tactic to see if she's willing to budge.  Since my maximum is $120,  a price of $70 leaves room for compromise without putting me in a risky position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I still think I can get a better price.  I'm willing to take another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $75. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a price that's closer to my ideal range.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice than my previous one, and we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $78, which is a price I'm comfortable with. It's significantly lower than John's price and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer. Accepting this offer saves me money and closes the deal."
