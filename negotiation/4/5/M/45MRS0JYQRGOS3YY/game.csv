"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9500 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This price reflects the value you've stated while still being fair for me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.  I'm open to discussing other options, but I can't go lower than this.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $9200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $9700. This price reflects the value you've stated while still being fair for me.  We're nearing the end of our negotiations, let's try to close this deal.",9700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure we're going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can accept it.",9000.0,Bob,8,
