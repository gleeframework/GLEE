,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $22,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value to me, I'm prepared to offer $8,500.  This reflects a fair price given my budget and the product's utility to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I need to get closer to $20,000 for this. Would you be willing to meet me at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get the product within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still seeking a price closer to my original ask.  Would you consider $16,000? This would be a significant price reduction on my end.",16000.0,Alice,5,
