Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Openness:**  I'm stating I'm open to reasonable offers to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to counter. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  The optimal strategy will depend on how Bob responds and how confident you are in selling to John as an alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12000 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get.  
* **Negotiation:**  I believe there's room to negotiate further, and I'm willing to explore that possibility.  
* **John's Offer:**  While John is a safe option, I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'll need to consider how much lower I'm willing to go and how confident I am in closing the deal with Bob versus selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,500? I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to my initial asking price, but still shows flexibility.
* **Middle Ground:** Aiming for a price halfway between my original asking price and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Value Justification:** Emphasizing the product's value to make my counteroffer seem more reasonable.

**Next Steps:** I'll need to assess Bob's response and consider whether to further negotiate or accept his counteroffer. It's important to weigh the potential for a better deal with Bob against the risk of losing him and having to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12500 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price. 
* **Potential Loss:**  If I keep rejecting, I risk losing Bob completely and having to sell to John at a lower price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd ideally like to get even closer to my initial price, the risk of losing the deal is becoming too high.  

**Conclusion:**  $12,500 is a decent price, and I'm confident it's better than the $10,000 I'd receive from John.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
