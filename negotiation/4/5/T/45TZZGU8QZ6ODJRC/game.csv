"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,050,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a better price point.  Would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,
