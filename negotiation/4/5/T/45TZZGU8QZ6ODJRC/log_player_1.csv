Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before considering John's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,050,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a better price point.  Would you consider $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not too worried about running out of time, as I have a backup offer from John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
