"While I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would still leave you with a healthy profit and allows me to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
