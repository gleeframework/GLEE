This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but below your minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to counterpropose a price of $1,100,000. This amount aligns more closely with my valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me a chance to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I've carefully considered your latest offer and am willing to counterpropose a price of $1,125,000. This amount is closer to the midpoint between our previous offers and represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,125,000 is a good compromise. Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal and having to settle with John at $1,500,000 is too high."
