"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and John is selling it at that price, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option. You can get the product for the same price from John, which means you don't need to accept Alice's offer."
