I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate as the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, and I'm prepared to accept a lower price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,400,000 is still a good amount of money, it's lower than my minimum desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
