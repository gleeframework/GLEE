"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even above its market price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget and even above her own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $8,000?"", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point that is significantly below Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. It aims to understand how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but she's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's the highest I can go."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

We're now pushing closer to your maximum budget, and by stating it's your highest possible price, it may encourage Alice to accept if she's willing to go that low."
