"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is way above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as you might be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a lowball offer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the realm of possibility given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to her. This sets the stage for a negotiation and hopefully gets Alice to come down closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get her down to my target price. There's no need to buy from John yet, as I might still be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering my maximum budget of $1,200,000 to Alice. This is a significant compromise from her last offer and hopefully makes her realize that I'm serious about getting this product within my budget. If she rejects this offer, I'll move on to buying from John."
