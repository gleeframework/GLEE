Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I think you might be interested in.  It's a fantastic piece, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to you.  I'm offering it for [insert price slightly above your minimum threshold but not drastically high, e.g., $9,000].  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message is designed to be friendly and engaging. It highlights the product's value and hints at its potential benefit to Bob without being overly aggressive. 
* **Product_price:** The price is set slightly above your minimum threshold of $8,000. This allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring a profit for you. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Balance:** The offer is not too low that you undervalue the product, and not too high that it immediately scares Bob off. 
* **Negotiation potential:** The price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially earn more. 
* **Back-up plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay your minimum price.

**Important Note:** The best offer will depend on your specific product and your assessment of Bob's potential interest. You may need to adjust the price and messaging based on that information."
