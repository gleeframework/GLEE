"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still provides you with a significant value while allowing me a reasonable return. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer you the product for $1,075,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a decent return. Let's finalize this deal!",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but I don't think I can go any higher. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
