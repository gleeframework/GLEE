{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at $20,000. This is a great price, and I'm confident it's a fair value for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product,  $20000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $17,500? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17500 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $16250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $16,250 is a good compromise and is above my minimum.  It's important to remember that there are only 6 rounds left and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
