"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at $20000. This is a great price, and I'm confident it's a fair value for both of us. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product,  $20000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $17500? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know your thoughts.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17500 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $16250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.",16250.0,Bob,4,
