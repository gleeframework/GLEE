"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at $20000. This is a great price, and I'm confident it's a fair value for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $20,000 is above his maximum budget of $15,000. It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product,  $20,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $17500? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $15,000.  He should continue to negotiate, aiming for a lower price. There's still room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,500 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $16,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 16250}
