"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $150? That's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to buying the product from John for $100, but I'd rather buy it from you. Can you meet me at $135? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",135.0,Bob,4,
