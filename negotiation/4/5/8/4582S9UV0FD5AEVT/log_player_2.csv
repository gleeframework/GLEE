"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. Considering its worth and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $120 for it. I believe this is a fair offer that respects both the value of the product and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your interest, I am willing to negotiate further. My revised offer is $110 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the value of the item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $110 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can try to negotiate a lower price again, as he still has rounds left and can always buy from John if he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your valuation of the product. In light of our previous discussions, I am willing to consider a final offer of $108 for the product. This is the best I can do while still ensuring a fair return for myself. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could continue negotiating and try to get the price down to $105, the risk is that Alice will refuse and Bob might be forced to buy from John for $100. 

Since Alice's offer of $108 is only $8 more than John's price, it's a good deal for Bob. It's worth taking the offer and securing the product."
