"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a good balance between what the product is worth to me and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $2,000,000 is a more accurate reflection of its value.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,900,000, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would be a substantial loss compared to John's offer. It's time to move on."
