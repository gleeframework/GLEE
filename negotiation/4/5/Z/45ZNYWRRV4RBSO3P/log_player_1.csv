Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant amount below Bob's perceived value, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to capture a good portion of the potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By offering $12,000, I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. It also ensures I'm not immediately accepting a price significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** The fact that I have a backup buyer (John) for $8,000 gives me a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I can still secure a decent profit. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $9,500 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:** I still have the leverage of having a backup buyer, and Bob has already indicated a willingness to negotiate. This means I can try to push for a higher price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a price closer to my ideal price point of $12,000. 

This strategy aims to continue negotiating with Bob in the hope of achieving a more favorable outcome than selling to John or accepting Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Signal of Flexibility:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to be flexible and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  $10,500 is still significantly higher than what I could get from John, so I retain leverage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer, leading to a quicker deal and a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (what I'd get from John).  
* **Risk of Stalemate:** If I reject Bob's offer again, there's a risk of entering a back-and-forth cycle where we keep rejecting each other's offers, potentially leading to a stalemate.
* **Securing a Profit:** While $9,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and a more than reasonable outcome given the negotiation's progress.

This decision aims to secure a sale and a profit, minimizing the risk of further negotiation or a stalemate."
