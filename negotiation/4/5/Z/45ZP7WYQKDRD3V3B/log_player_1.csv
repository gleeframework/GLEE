Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so anything above that is a win.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than that.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal depends on you convincing Bob to pay more than he values the product.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on pure numbers, you need to create value for Bob. This means understanding why the product is worth $1,200,000 to him and finding ways to increase that perceived value.  

**Information is Key**

You need more information about the product and why it's valuable to Bob.  This will help you tailor your message and potentially justify a higher price.

**Example Offer (Without Additional Information)**

Since we lack information to create additional value, this offer relies on Bob being willing to pay a premium for a faster deal:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this product before I open it up to other buyers.  While I have significant interest, I believe in giving valued contacts the first opportunity.  I'm willing to make this deal happen for $1,450,000.  This offer stands for the next 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Creates a sense that Bob is getting a special opportunity.
* **High Price:** Still below your guaranteed offer but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Time Limit:**  Adds pressure for Bob to decide quickly. 

**Important Notes:**

* **This is a risky strategy.** Without more information, there's a high chance Bob will reject the offer.
* **Gather information!** Before sending any offer, try to learn:
    * What specifically makes the product valuable to Bob?
    * Are there any add-ons or services you can include to increase the value proposition?
    * What is Bob's timeline for needing this product?

Let me know if you can provide more details about the product and Bob's needs. I can then give you a more tailored and potentially successful offer."
