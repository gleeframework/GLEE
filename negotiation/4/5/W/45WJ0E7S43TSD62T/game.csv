"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but would only be willing to pay $110 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair price that's a good middle ground for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $125. It's a fair price that's close to our previous offers, and I think it's a good compromise.",125.0,Alice,5,
