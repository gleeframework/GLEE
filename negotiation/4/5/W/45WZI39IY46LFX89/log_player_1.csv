Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to John's offer ($1,000,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting high ($950,000) creates room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested parties introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Confidence:** Highlighting the product's value builds Bob's perceived value and justifies the high price. 
 
This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a deal before resorting to John's offer."
