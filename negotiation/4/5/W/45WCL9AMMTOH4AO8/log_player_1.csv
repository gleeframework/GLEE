Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $130 because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm also not going to sell to John yet because I can potentially get a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $130 is a bit too low for me at this point, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $155?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $155. How about $142.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not going to accept Bob's offer of $142.50. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping to get even closer to my desired price with continued negotiation. I'm not going to sell to John yet because I'm confident I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $142.50 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $147.50. Let's see if we can reach a compromise that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 147.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further! However, $147.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $142.50 and $147.50. How about $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $145. Although it's still slightly below my desired price, it's getting closer and it's a good deal considering we only have 4 rounds left. It's also better than selling to John for $150."
