"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would help me reach a fair price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
