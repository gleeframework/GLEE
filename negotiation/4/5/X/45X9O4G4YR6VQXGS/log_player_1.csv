"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180.  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but it's also a decent starting point for me to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $170. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I think it shows good faith while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $165 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
