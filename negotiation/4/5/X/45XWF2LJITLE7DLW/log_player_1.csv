Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,600,000, you set a high anchor. While Bob may counter significantly lower, the initial high price can influence his perception of the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000. This knowledge allows you to negotiate with Bob more confidently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product, as I believe this reflects its true value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you want to make a deal, you are better off negotiating further. You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to push for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Firm:**  You're acknowledging Bob's offer but standing firm on the product's value. A significant price reduction from your initial offer shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position.
* **Targeting Above Minimum:** This counteroffer aims for a price well above your $1,200,000 minimum, leaving space for potential further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a counteroffer, you keep the negotiation active and encourage Bob to continue engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,450,000 is still a stretch for me. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget. I believe this is a good starting point for a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
