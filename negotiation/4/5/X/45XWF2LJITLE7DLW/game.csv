"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product, as I believe this reflects its true value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,450,000 is still a stretch for me. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget. I believe this is a good starting point for a final agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
