"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring. I believe it's a good middle ground between our initial offers.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1100000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. I think this is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good value for the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
