"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I do believe it would be valuable to me, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me.  This product is very high-quality and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of value. Could you meet me halfway at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $13,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
