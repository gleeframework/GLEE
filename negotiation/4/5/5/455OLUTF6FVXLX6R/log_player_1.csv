Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer allows for a decent profit for Alice while still being attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $15,000.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is more than Alice's minimum, it's still significantly less than the $14,000 she initially offered and well below the product's value to Bob. Rejecting Bob's offer allows Alice to try and secure a higher price by making a counteroffer.  There's still a good chance Bob will accept a price closer to her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While I believe the product is valuable, $12,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be open to $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than Alice's initial ask, it's getting closer to her desired price. Considering that Bob might be unwilling to budge further, it's likely more profitable for Alice to accept his offer now rather than risk further negotiations. She could end up with less or even have to sell to John for the lower price. Accepting Bob's offer allows for a relatively quick and profitable sale."
