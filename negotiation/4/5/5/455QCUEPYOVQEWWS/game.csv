"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. Based on its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1800000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth, but I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and show my commitment to the purchase. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your commitment, $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1500000. This price represents a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1500000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer of $1350000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
