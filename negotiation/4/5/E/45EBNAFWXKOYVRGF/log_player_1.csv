{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a significant profit margin for you (almost double Bob's perceived value). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer. It positions the price at a point where you have a high likelihood of still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no immediate time pressure to sell the product. If a quick sale is essential, adjusting the price closer to $1,500,000 might be necessary."
