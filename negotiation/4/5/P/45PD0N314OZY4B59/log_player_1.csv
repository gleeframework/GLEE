Bob seems firmly rooted at $825,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to my desired price. Accepting his offer would net me more than John's offer, but it's a minimal gain for the additional time and effort.  Selling to John for $800,000 ensures a quick and guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
