"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially suggesting a price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower and propose a counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but that offer is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to accept $875,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value this product brings.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to accept $875,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,6,
