Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John.  While $12,000 is a lower price than what John is willing to pay, it still offers a significant profit for Alice. This strategy maximizes the chance of securing a sale while keeping the potential profit relatively high."
