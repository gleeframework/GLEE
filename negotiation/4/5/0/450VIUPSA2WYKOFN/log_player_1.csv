Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high price. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still quite far apart. I can increase my offer to $1,200,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

We're still significantly below John's offer. Let's see if we can negotiate Bob closer to at least $1,400,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that final offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{

}
```

While we could push Bob a bit further, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $1,400,000. Accepting this offer gives us a sure $1,400,000, which is a good deal considering it's more than Bob initially offered and significantly more than his initial valuation.  John's offer is only slightly better, and continuing to negotiate has risks."
