Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I'll try to counter-offer in the next round."

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,200 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,350.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to where we want to be. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10350}

Round 6

This is a good deal for me - it's closer to my target price and I'm happy to accept Bob's offer.  I think we've both made a good effort to negotiate, and I'm confident this deal will work out well for both of us."
