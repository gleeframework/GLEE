"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite close to her value, it makes sense to negotiate and try to get a lower price. It's too early to buy from John since we might get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A strong counteroffer can reveal how much Alice is willing to budge. 
* **Establish a negotiation range:** Starting low sets the stage for potential compromises closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved a good amount from her initial offer, showing she is willing to negotiate. However, her current offer is still more expensive than buying from John. We are likely to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a strict budget. Could we meet in the middle at $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By moving closer to Alice's price, we demonstrate we are serious about reaching a deal.
* **Target the middle ground:** This offer splits the difference between her last offer ($10,500) and our previous counteroffer ($9,000), encouraging a collaborative approach.
* **Maintain a buffer from John's price:**  Staying below $10,000 ensures we still have room to potentially get a better deal than buying directly from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to work with you, but $9,750 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly reducing her offer price, and we are now very close to John's price. It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly enough to be worth the risk of continued negotiation. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John at a known, acceptable price."
