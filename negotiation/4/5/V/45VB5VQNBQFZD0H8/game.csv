"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  I'm asking for $1,000,000, which reflects its unique qualities. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $650,000?  I think that's a fair price.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. Let's find common ground, and I'm confident we can make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $900,000. Would you consider $720,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your position, $720,000 is still significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while ensuring I receive a reasonable return. Let's make this deal work.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $785,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",785000.0,Bob,6,
