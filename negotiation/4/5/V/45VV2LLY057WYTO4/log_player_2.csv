"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm looking for $11,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is asking for $11,500. This leaves very little room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.** You can start by offering a lower price, hoping to get a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  I'm offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This shows I'm serious about buying but also trying to secure a good deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for future counteroffers and allows for a more gradual negotiation process. 
* **Keeps the Pressure On:**  By making a bold counteroffer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right, encouraging Alice to consider my offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer, but still not ideal.**  $11,000 is closer to my target price of $12,000, but it's still $1,000 higher than I'm willing to pay right now.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so I believe I can push for a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always a safe option.**  If I can't get a better deal from Alice, I have John as a backup.

I'm going to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Considering the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to meet in the middle and find common ground.
* **Strong Justification:**  I'm emphasizing the value I place on the product, which helps to justify my offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Alice to accept my offer.

This counteroffer is more aggressive than the previous one, but it's still reasonable and leaves room for a final compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Considering the value you're placing on the product, I'll offer it to you for $10,900. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Target:** Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to my target price of $10,750.
* **Limited Time:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.
* **Possible Future Deal:**  If I accept this offer, there's a chance I could negotiate a further discount in the future, as Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. 

This is the best deal I can realistically expect from Alice, and accepting it ensures I get the product while still saving money compared to buying from John."
