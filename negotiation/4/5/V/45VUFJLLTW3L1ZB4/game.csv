"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. To meet somewhere in the middle, I'm willing to offer the product for $10,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's lower than my original asking price but still higher than your last offer. Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
