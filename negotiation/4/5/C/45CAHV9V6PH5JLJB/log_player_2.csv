``` 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is below John's:**  Alice's offer of $720,000 is less than John's standing offer of $800,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is likely to keep negotiating in smaller increments. The potential savings from further rounds might not outweigh the risk of her walking away. 
* **Time Value:** Each round represents time and effort.  Securing the deal now has its own value."
