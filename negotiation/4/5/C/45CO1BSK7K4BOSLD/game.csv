"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth more than that to me. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I've done my research as well, and I believe the product is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. Can you consider that price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is a compromise that should be more in line with the value I believe the product holds.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
