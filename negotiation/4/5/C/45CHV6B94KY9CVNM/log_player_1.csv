Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a fantastic deal considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting at $200, we can observe Bob's reaction.  If he immediately rejects it, we know he's looking for a significantly lower price. If he counters, it indicates he's at least somewhat interested. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have John as a backup buyer at $150, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your price is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, his message suggests he's interested in negotiating. Rejecting his offer allows us to counter and explore if we can reach a more agreeable price.
* **Backup Plan:** We still have John as a reliable buyer at $150. This gives us leverage in the negotiation, knowing we don't have to settle for a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $160."", 
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We're moving closer to the middle ground between Bob's initial offer and our initial asking price. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** The $160 offer is still comfortably above our minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring a reasonable profit if accepted.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's flexibility. If he rejects this, we may need to consider lowering further or walking away."
