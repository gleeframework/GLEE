"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a fantastic deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it at $200. This is a terrible deal. You should reject her offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your price is way too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's counteroffer of $160 is still too high for you, as you're only willing to pay $80.  Since John is selling the product for your maximum price, it's best to buy from John to avoid further negotiations with Alice."
