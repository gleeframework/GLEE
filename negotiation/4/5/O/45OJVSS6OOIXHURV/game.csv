"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000 for the product.  Would you consider a price in that range?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer you $700,000.  This is a fair offer considering I can purchase it from another seller for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
