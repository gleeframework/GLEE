Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

**Reasoning:** Alice is unwilling to go below $850,000.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. It makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $50,000."
