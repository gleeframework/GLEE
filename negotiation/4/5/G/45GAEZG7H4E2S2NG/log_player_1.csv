Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While a high initial offer is good, leaving some room for negotiation is wise. Bob might counter-offer, and you want to avoid potentially losing the sale by being too inflexible. 
* **Consider Your Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John.  Your offer to Bob should be significantly higher than this to justify the risk of him rejecting the offer."
