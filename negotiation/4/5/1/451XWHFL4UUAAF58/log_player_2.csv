"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's room for a better price, and 10 rounds gives plenty of time to explore that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $50,000 drop from her initial price shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal, while still being within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still worth pushing for a lower offer. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's still a chance to secure a better deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below Alice's last offer. This strategy aims to meet in the middle and potentially close the deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer to a deal, but it's still worth trying to get Alice down to $910,000. Since we have several rounds left, it's reasonable to continue negotiating rather than accepting her offer or switching to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 915000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $915,000, meeting Alice halfway from the previous round. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my ideal. With fewer rounds remaining, it's time to start closing the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $918,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $918,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $918,000 is very close to my target price.  With only three rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high. If Alice rejects my counteroffer, she might increase her offer to a point where it's no longer worth trying to push further.  Accepting her offer now secures a good deal with minimal risk."
