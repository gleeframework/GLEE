"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm aiming for a higher figure, I'm open to finding a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant gain.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is still too high for my budget. Perhaps we can find a price that works for both of us?  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,5,
