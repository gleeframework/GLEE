Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value you place on it, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $15000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product to you, I would like to propose a price of $16000. This still falls within my budget while also reflecting the value I see in the product.
