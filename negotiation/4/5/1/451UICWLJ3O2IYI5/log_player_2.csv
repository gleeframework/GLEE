"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $95**, which is less than your maximum budget of $120.
* **Buying from John costs $120**, which is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes sense to **accept Alice's offer** and save $25 compared to buying from John."
