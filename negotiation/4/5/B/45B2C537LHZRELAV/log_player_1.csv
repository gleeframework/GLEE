Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the risk of a substantial loss.
