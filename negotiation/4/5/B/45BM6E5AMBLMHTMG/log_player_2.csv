{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to the budget, there are still rounds left.  It's worth pushing for a final compromise with Alice, aiming for a price closer to the desired $800,000. Buying from John is still an option if negotiations fail, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
