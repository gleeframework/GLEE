"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you $8,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
