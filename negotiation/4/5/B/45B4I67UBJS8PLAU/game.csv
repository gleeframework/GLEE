"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1400000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1500000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I recognize the product's value, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to consider a price of $1350000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to meet you halfway.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1350000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit above my target.  How about $1325000? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to close this deal without either of us feeling we've made too much of a concession.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a fair compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1325000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering the product to you for $1320000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
