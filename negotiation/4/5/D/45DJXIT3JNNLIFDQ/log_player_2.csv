"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  Alice's initial offer is your maximum budget, so there's room to try and get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price and will test her willingness to negotiate.  It's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, but it establishes a starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I still have room to negotiate. There's a good chance I can get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to try and improve the deal further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but still willing to compromise. It also keeps the pressure on her to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000. This is a good deal compared to her initial offer and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  It saves me $350,000 compared to buying from John and it's highly likely that I won't be able to get a much lower price from Alice in the remaining rounds."
