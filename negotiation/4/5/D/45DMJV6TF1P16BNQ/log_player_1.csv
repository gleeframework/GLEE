"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential for your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  By starting at $2,000,000, I'm setting a high bar and leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Focus on Value:**  My message emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob's business, aiming to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message also signals that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm starting strong. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a favorable outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential for my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  There's room to find a middle ground that benefits both of us.
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a good option, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob to see if I can secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price or potentially closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm countering with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Value Emphasis:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value, trying to persuade Bob that my price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable and productive.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price while still leaving some room for potential profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next offer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value and potential for my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 aligns perfectly with my minimum acceptable price. This means I won't lose money on the sale.
* **No Further Upside:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge, and I risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time is of the Essence:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing too much time on further negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale, securing a solid price for the product."
