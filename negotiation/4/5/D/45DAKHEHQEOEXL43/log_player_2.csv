# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to accommodate your needs.  This price still reflects the product's worth and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
