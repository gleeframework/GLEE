"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to accommodate your needs.  This price still reflects the product's worth and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
