"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is below my minimum threshold, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,300,000. This price reflects the value you've acknowledged and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,300,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value you've expressed, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
