Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and the demand, I'm proposing a price of $22,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn significantly more from Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $22,000 leaves room for negotiation.  It's unlikely Bob will immediately accept, but it anchors the negotiation at a higher point than if you started closer to $15,000.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright, and you'll have to settle for the guaranteed $15,000 from John. However, the potential for a much higher profit from Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
