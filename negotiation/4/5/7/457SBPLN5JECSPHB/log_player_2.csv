# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and the demand, I'm proposing a price of $22,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $8,000."
