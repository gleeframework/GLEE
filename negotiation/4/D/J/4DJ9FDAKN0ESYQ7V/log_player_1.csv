Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and not risk losing the opportunity.

By starting high but still below Bob's perceived value, you increase your chances of getting the best possible price."
