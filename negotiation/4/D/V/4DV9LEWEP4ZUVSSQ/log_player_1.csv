Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $10,000 is more than what Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $10,000 is still significantly above your minimum of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation.

This allows for a back and forth that could potentially lead to a price that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $12,000,  $9,000 is still a good deal considering Bob's initial offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
