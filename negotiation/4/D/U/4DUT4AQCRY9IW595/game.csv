"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is fair considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussion, I am proposing a new price of $900,000 for the product.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's work together to close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
