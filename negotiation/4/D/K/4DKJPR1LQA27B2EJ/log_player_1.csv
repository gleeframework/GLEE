"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I know Bob values the product at $80, so $200 is a significant markup. This will test his willingness to negotiate and give me room to maneuver in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, I still believe I can get a better price.  I will reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm reducing my price from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum value of $150.  This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to give away too much profit. I hope to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject and counter again, hoping to secure a better deal before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $160 is a good compromise that allows for some profit while acknowledging Bob's negotiating stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I believe I can secure a better price by rejecting and making one final counteroffer before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

This is my final offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept, as it's only $5 away from his latest offer. If he doesn't, I'll move on and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150, which at least guarantees me my minimum acceptable profit."
