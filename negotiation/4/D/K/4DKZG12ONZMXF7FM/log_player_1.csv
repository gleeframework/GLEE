Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above my minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation."
