Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Backup Plan:**  The offer is still significantly higher than John's $8,000 offer, ensuring a profit even if Bob rejects the initial price."
