"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $110 for it.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make the purchase right away.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like that you're willing to compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's worth it for the quality of the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
