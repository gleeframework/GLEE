The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is asking for $180, which is too high. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems she's not willing to budge.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $120. It's a better deal than accepting Alice's offer."
