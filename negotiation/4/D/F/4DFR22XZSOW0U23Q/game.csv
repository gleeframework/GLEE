"I can see you're really serious about getting the product, and I appreciate your commitment. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's the best price I can offer, and I hope you can see the value in it.",13500.0,Alice,7,
