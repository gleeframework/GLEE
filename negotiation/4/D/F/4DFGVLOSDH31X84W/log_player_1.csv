"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

* I want to maximize my profit while acknowledging Bob's perceived value.
* I want to get a sense of Bob's willingness to negotiate before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Floor:**  While $9,000 is closer to my floor price of $12,000, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's room for a higher offer. 
* **Potential for Improvement:** By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's still a chance to get a better price than his initial counteroffer. 
* I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe I can achieve a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for something a little closer to $10,000 to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility.
* **Maintain High Value:** I'm still holding onto a higher price point, indicating that I'm confident in the product's worth.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

* I want to continue negotiating, but I also want to avoid going too low too quickly. 
* This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and potentially get closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $9,000. Is there any flexibility on your end? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer to my floor price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for Compromise:** I believe there's still room for a compromise, especially as Bob has expressed interest in the product.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and show Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale. 

**Strategy:**

* I want to continue negotiating and explore the possibility of getting closer to my target price of $10,000.
* Selling to John is still an option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, I'm flexible.  Let's split the difference. How about $9,250? This would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is a significant compromise on my part, showing Bob my willingness to close the deal.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair solution that benefits both of us.
* **Emphasis on Closing:** I'm using language that suggests this could be our final offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping this final compromise will be enough to convince Bob. 
* If he rejects, I'm prepared to move on to John, but I'm still hopeful for a deal with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $9,125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is very close to my floor price, and the difference is minimal. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only four rounds left, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer. 
* **Potential for Delay:**  Rejecting Bob's offer risks further negotiation and potential delays, especially if I need to counteroffer and wait for his response.

**Strategy:**

*  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and allows me to avoid potential delays and the risk of not reaching a deal. 
* While not ideal, the price is acceptable, and it's better to close the deal now than to risk losing a sale entirely."
