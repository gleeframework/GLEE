I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This is still a profitable price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk going lower and potentially ending up with a loss.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit."
