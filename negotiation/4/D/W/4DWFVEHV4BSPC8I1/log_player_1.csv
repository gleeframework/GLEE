Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (Bob's value minus your minimum)

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that is attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal, increasing the risk of rejection.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and represents an excellent investment for you. "", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It positions the product as valuable and emphasizes exclusivity, appealing to Bob's potential gain.
* **The Price:**  $1,150,000 allows Bob to realize $50,000 in perceived value (his $1,200,000 valuation minus your offer). This increases the likelihood of acceptance while still securing a $150,000 profit for you.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your offer slightly if Bob counters, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum."
