Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit lower than $15,000 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Time Value and Certainty:** While you have John as a backup, selling to Bob directly saves you time and guarantees the sale. 

By offering the product at $14,000, you create a win-win situation where Bob gets the product at a price lower than his perceived value, and you secure a profit of $2,000, which is higher than your guaranteed sale to John."
