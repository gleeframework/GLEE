"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $1,100,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,125,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $1,075,000? This is a good compromise that keeps things moving.",1075000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
