"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  There are still rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth rejecting the initial offer and trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit higher than what he's willing to pay.  There are still several rounds left, making it worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $1,100,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still very close to his ideal price point.  He can likely get closer to $1,000,000 with more negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and counteroffering gives him a better chance of getting a lower price without having to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,125,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $1,075,000? This is a good compromise that keeps things moving."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of running out of time. Alice has shown that she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,100,000, and with only a few rounds left, the chances of getting a better deal are slim.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy from John at $1,000,000 and secure the product at his ideal price point."
