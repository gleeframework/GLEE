"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me significant profit.  I'll see how he reacts and adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I still believe I can get closer to my desired value. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,000,000, as I think I can squeeze more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going down a bit, but still aiming for a significant profit. This counteroffer shows flexibility,  but I'm not willing to go much lower at this point. I want to see if Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm accepting this offer because:

* **Time is running out:**  We are already on Round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a good deal by being too stubborn. 
* **Risk of John:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I might end up having to sell to John for $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  While I'm accepting this offer now, I can always try to negotiate a better price on future deals with Bob if we have a good relationship."
