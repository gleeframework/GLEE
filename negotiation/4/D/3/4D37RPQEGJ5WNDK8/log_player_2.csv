"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is a decent price, but Bob can likely get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we start at $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're not willing to go to $10,500.  I'm still interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $11,000.  This is a fair price given the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $11,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,750 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still a bit high.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible and believes he can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  The threat of buying from John for $15,000 gives Bob leverage to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $11,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $11,250, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to get the product for under $11,000 but it seems Alice is firm on $11,500.  While it's not the absolute lowest price, accepting this offer still saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John.  At this point, with only a few rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a deal with Alice outweighs the potential to get a slightly lower price."
