"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  $90 is a good starting point, but we can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

Let's start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give us room to negotiate and see how much she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$85 is still a bit high, and we have several rounds left.  Let's see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

We're getting closer to our goal. Let's offer $80, which is only $5 below Alice's latest offer.  This shows we're serious about buying but still want a fair price."
