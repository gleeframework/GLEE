"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and leaves room for us both to benefit from the deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $15,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  If we can agree on this, we can finalize the deal and avoid further negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $10,800. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,800 is still a little high for me. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm offering $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and it's also within my budget. Let's close this deal and move forward.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $10,700. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10700.0,Alice,7,
