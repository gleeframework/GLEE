Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It allows for potential compromise:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly or see if he'll counteroffer.

Keep in mind, the negotiation is a dynamic process. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to squeeze a little more out of the deal. You know the product is worth significantly more to him ($12,000), so there's room for negotiation.

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** This demonstrates that you're not desperate for a sale and are willing to walk away if you don't get a price that reflects the product's value.
* **Counteroffering:**  By rejecting and counteroffering, you can try to find a middle ground. You'll be able to gauge if Bob is truly willing to walk away from the deal or if he's willing to negotiate further.

**Next steps:**

You should send a counteroffer that's slightly lower than your initial offer, but still above Bob's $8,000.  This could be something like $9,000 or $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my financial situation, I cannot go above $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet at that price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that he is unwilling to budge from his $8,000 offer.  While this is your minimum, you've already tried to negotiate and haven't been able to reach a higher price. 

* **Selling to John:**  This option guarantees you your minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems unlikely to increase his offer. You don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially lose time and end up with the same $8,000 price.

**Key Takeaway:** It's important to recognize when a negotiation has reached a stalemate and to accept a fair deal, even if it's not your ideal outcome."
