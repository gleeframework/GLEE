"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's worth a bit more than $100. How about we try $110? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $105? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going, but I really do think this product could be a great fit for me.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I think the product is worth a bit more than that. How about we try $108? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the value the product provides.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still not willing to budge on the price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $107? That's the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in the product.",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $107. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $107, which would be $105.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the value the product provides.",105.5,Alice,7,
