"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below the value of this product. It offers unique capabilities and solutions that I'm confident would provide you with a substantial return on your investment. I'm willing to consider $900,000. This reflects my strong belief in its worth while acknowledging your budgetary considerations.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I still feel that $750,000 is a fair price considering my budget constraints. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll consider purchasing the product from John at his price of $1,000,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,
