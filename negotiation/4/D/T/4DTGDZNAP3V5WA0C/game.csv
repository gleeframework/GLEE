"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider letting it go for $1,100,000. This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
