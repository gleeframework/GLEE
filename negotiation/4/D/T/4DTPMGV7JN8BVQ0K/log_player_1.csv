Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently unwilling to meet Alice's price expectations.  His counteroffers are incrementally increasing but still significantly lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price. At this point, continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob not reaching a price point that is acceptable to Alice. Since Alice has a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it's in her best interest to take the sure thing and maximize her profit."
