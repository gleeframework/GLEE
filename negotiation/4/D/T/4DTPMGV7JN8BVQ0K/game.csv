"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that allows us both to benefit.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $975,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be transparent. While I'm aiming for a deal that benefits us both, I also have another potential buyer for this product at a higher price point.  To be fair to you, I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,012,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than reasonable given the product's value.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",950000.0,Bob,6,
