Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $20,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line. This provides a basis for the asking price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not overly aggressive and invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving room for counter-offers. 

By starting high and being open to negotiation, Alice maximizes her chances of either securing a higher price from Bob or falling back on her guaranteed sale to John."
