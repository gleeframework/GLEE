"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is way over his budget, and he has a better option with John.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $15,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant reduction and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $13,500 is still higher than his preferred price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his target of $8,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  To meet you halfway, I can do $12,000. This is my final offer as it represents the lowest I can go.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down in price, she's still above Bob's budget.  John offers a price that fits Bob's budget perfectly, making it the best choice."
