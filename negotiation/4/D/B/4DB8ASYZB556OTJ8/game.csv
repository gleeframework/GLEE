"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe you'll find immense value in it too. I'm willing to sell it for $1,250,000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from owning it. Let me know your thoughts!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product is valuable, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. This product is truly special, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a fair return on my investment while acknowledging your budgetary constraints.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
