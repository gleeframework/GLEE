"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",6000.0,Bob,2,
