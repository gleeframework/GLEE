Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking that $1,050,000 is still a bit low for the value this product brings.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering a price that is very close to my ideal price.  At this point, I'm concerned about running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's a small increase from my last offer, but it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John. I'm going to accept her offer."
