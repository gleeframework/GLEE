Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the product's true worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this number.

While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, it's still above my maximum. I'll try to negotiate further."
