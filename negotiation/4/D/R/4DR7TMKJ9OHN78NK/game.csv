,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However, $775000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800000, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen!",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $800000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $780000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $790000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $785000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",785000.0,Bob,8,
