"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** It's worth trying to get a lower price, especially since Alice is likely willing to sell for less than $11,500 (her value is $10,000). 
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  This provides a safety net, but you'd prefer to save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:** This shows you're serious about negotiating and are willing to make a substantial move. 
* **Offer within your budget:** $10,500 is below your maximum budget, giving you some room for future negotiations.
* **Consider Alice's value:** Your offer is still above Alice's value of $10,000, leaving potential for a win-win agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price.** While it's a step in the right direction, it's still closer to her value than yours. 
* **There's still room to negotiate.** You can likely get the price down further, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  You have time and opportunity to try and get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,750? It's still above your value and closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** This offer is a smaller step than your previous one, showing you're willing to compromise but not give in completely.
* **Splitting the difference:**  It's a middle ground between your previous offer of $10,500 and Alice's current offer of $11,000. 
* **Emphasize fairness:**  Reiterating the idea of a fair price for both parties increases the chances of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further to $10,900.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $10,900 is well below your maximum of $12,000.
* **You're getting a good deal:** While it's not your initial target, it's a fair price considering Alice's value and your willingness to negotiate.
* **Time is running out:** You've already gone through several rounds, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds. 

It's a good compromise and a reasonable outcome for both parties."
