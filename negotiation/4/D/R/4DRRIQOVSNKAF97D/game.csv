"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is my best price for now.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
