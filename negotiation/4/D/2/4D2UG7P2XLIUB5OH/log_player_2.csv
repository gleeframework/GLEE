"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to you and my budget, I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than his initial budget of $15,000, and it's closer to his counteroffer of $10,000.  Since there's a chance Alice might not accept another counteroffer, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
