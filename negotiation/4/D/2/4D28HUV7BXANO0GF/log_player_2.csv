"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $120 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80. It makes sense for Bob to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his maximum budget of $80 and making a firm counteroffer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also unwilling to go beyond his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $100, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $100, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. Bob should continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. There are still rounds remaining, and there's a chance Alice may be willing to go lower. If not, Bob can always buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet me at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps me within my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to negotiate a lower price, but he is showing a willingness to compromise.  By offering $90, he is  meeting Alice halfway from her previous offer of $100.  This approach shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but he's not going to overpay.  It's a reasonable counteroffer that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $95, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. There are still rounds remaining, and Bob can try to negotiate a lower price. Buying from John for $80 remains a viable option if Bob can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $90, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $90. He believes this is a fair price and is showing Alice that he is serious about closing the deal but is unwilling to go beyond his budget.  This is a firm but respectful counteroffer, leaving the ball in Alice's court."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to go down to $92.50, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92.50 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. With only a few rounds remaining, the chances of Alice coming down further seem slim. It's more cost-effective for Bob to buy the product from John for $80, as this ensures a deal within his budget and saves time."
