"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  There's no reason to accept the offer when there's a possibility of a better deal.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob can enter a negotiation and potentially get a lower price.  Additionally,  he can always choose to buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his $1,000,000 limit as possible.  A $1,100,000 offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price and demonstrates Bob's serious interest in buying. It's likely to be a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's closer to his target price, he can likely do better with continued negotiation.  He has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation fails, so there's no immediate pressure to accept.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about buying but still trying to keep the price below his ideal $1,000,000. A $1,200,000 counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while leaving room for further concessions from Alice.  It's a middle ground that potentially puts pressure on Alice to accept before she risks Bob walking away to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still significantly above his target of $1,000,000. He's already negotiated a drop of $200,000 from Alice's original offer, demonstrating his willingness to bargain. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and potentially leads to a price closer to Bob's desired range.  He has the security of John's offer, giving him leverage in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting very close to his maximum price.  A counteroffer of $1,250,000 shows a clear commitment to buying but leaves a small buffer for potential negotiation.  This is a strong middle ground that could push Alice towards acceptance, especially with the knowledge that Bob could walk away and buy from John for $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,260,000 is tempting, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  He has shown a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to his target price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and potentially leads to a more favorable price.  He can always go to John for $1,000,000 if needed, giving him leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now within a very narrow margin of his target price. This counteroffer of $1,225,000 is a strong attempt to reach a compromise with Alice while staying within his budget. It's likely to push Alice closer to accepting, as she's already significantly reduced her price and Bob is showing clear intent to purchase. If this offer is rejected, Bob might be willing to accept Alice's next offer or move to John, depending on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer.  Considering they have only one round remaining before needing to decide on John's offer, accepting this offer makes sense.  It's a good compromise that achieves Bob's goal of acquiring the product while staying within his budget.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product without taking the risk of losing it to another buyer."
