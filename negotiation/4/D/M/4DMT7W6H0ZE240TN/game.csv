"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is just too low for me. How about $85?  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $80? That's the absolute highest I can go, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
