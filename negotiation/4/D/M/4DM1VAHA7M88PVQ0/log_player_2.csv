You can do better than $90. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
You're getting a good deal at $87.50, and it's better than going with John and paying $100. There's a good chance you could get it for even lower, but the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it."
