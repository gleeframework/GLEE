Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $120. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to be closer to $115 to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I have a few rounds left, so I'll see if I can get Bob to budge further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $108 is still a bit low for me.  How about we compromise at $112? It's a fair midpoint between our last offers."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable going above $108, and I think $112 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $112, which is $110, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you accept $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $110. While it's not my ideal price, it's the best I can get from Bob at this point. I only have 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  $110 is still a decent profit, and it's better than risking getting nothing if I keep pushing for a higher price."
