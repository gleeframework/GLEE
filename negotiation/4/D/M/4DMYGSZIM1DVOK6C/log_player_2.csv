"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great opportunity to get a significant return on your investment. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While she claims it's worth $12,000 to you, you have a backup option for that price.
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to overpay. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer.  

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Alice closer to her own perceived value of $8,000. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for further negotiation."
