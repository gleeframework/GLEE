Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not sure it's enough. I'm willing to make one more compromise. Let's try $910,000. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for the sale.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $900,000 and we have a sure option at $800,000.  We've made a good faith effort to negotiate but taking the guaranteed savings makes more sense now."
