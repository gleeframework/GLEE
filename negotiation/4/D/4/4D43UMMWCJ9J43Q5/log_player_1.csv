Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Minimum:** The offer is significantly above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000), ensuring a profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, selling to Bob quickly might be more desirable than waiting for a potentially slower deal with John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
