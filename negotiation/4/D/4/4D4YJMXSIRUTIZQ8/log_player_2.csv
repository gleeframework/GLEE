It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price, especially with a significant difference like this.  There's a good chance you can get a better deal from Alice."

I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This will hopefully incentivize Alice to negotiate further, while also showing I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation. I'll reject her offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $700,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to get the best possible price. Hopefully, Alice will find this offer more appealing and we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $775,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting further offers and me having to buy from John at a much higher price is not worth it.  At this price, I can still save a considerable amount of money and secure the product."
