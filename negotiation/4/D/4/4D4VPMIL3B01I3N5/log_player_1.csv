"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a high price, but it's also reasonable, given Bob's perceived value.  This allows for some negotiation room while still securing a strong profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to the value of the product to both parties. How about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired value of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, as I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While your offer is closer, it's still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925,000? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose $900,000. This is closer to the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe we can reach a more agreeable price with a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $912,500? It's a fair price that reflects both of our needs. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I am willing to pay $905,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $905,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $905,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I'd prefer, we're getting close to the middle ground.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit for me and a successful negotiation."
