"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to offer $8,000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we meet in the middle a bit? Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
