"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to offer $8,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a price closer to his maximum budget. This demonstrates Bob's seriousness about purchasing the product but also sets a clear expectation of a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we meet in the middle a bit? Would you consider $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try to secure a better price. It's also worth considering that there's a potential for a deal with John, who's offering a fixed price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's price, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. However, he's still holding back a little, keeping some room for further negotiation. This counteroffer also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, which might influence Alice's decision."
