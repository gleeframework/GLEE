"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves a good amount of profit for you.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above your minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
