"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $17,000. Would you be open to considering a price of $17,000?

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you being so straightforward in this negotiation.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us, $17,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $18,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're a serious buyer.  To be frank, $16,500 is pushing my limit, and I have other interested parties.  If you're willing to meet me at $17,500, we have a deal. Otherwise, I need to consider my other options.",17500.0,Alice,7,
