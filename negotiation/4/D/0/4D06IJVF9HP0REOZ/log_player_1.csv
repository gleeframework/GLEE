Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. While my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to make this offer very attractive to you. What would you say to a price of $950,000?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she wants to maximize her profit.  Starting with a price closer to her own valuation ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By mentioning a ""confidential"" minimum price, Alice creates the impression that she might have other offers, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $950,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still remaining significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has the security of John as a backup buyer, giving her leverage in negotiations with Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a successful sale."
