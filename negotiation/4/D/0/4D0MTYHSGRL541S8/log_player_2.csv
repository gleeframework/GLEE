It's getting close to the end of the negotiation and Alice is clearly signaling she's willing to walk away. While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she'll follow through and you'll end up paying John's much higher price. Accepting $918,000 guarantees a significant saving compared to John."
