Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and at this point, the potential savings from haggling aren't worth the risk of her withdrawing the offer. John offers a sure way to stay within budget."
