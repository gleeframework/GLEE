"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still above your target of $150 maximum. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above your target of $150.  You can continue negotiating with Alice, as you're still closer to her price than buying from John. You may be able to get the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to your target of $150, you are still slightly above your budget.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get it down to $125 or less.  If Alice rejects this counteroffer, you can buy from John."
