"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $8500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
