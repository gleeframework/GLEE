# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. It's worth rejecting and sending a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from reaching my target price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a new price of $900000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and sending a counteroffer closer to your desired price of $850,000.  You can potentially reach a compromise somewhere between $850,000 and $900,000."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $912,500 is still above what you're willing to pay. You can continue negotiating and try to get a better price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you've made a final offer, but I'm still not willing to accept $890000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go below $920000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing a new price of $905500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price.  While $905,500 is still higher than your ideal price, it's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,200,000. Accepting the offer would save you $294,500, making it the most financially beneficial option. 

It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a much lower price from Alice.  While you might be able to push for a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and potentially leaving you with no other options except buying from John at a much higher price."
