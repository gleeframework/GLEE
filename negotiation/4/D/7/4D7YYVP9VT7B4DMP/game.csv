"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true market value. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's aim to reach an agreement. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? This is a reasonable compromise, and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this transaction.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my target price, but $925,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let's come to an agreement.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I value our negotiations and appreciate you getting closer to my price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and accept $915,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us to close this deal and move forward. Let's make this happen!",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there! I'm willing to go up to $912,000, which is just a small step away from your last offer.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to close this deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",912000.0,Bob,8,
