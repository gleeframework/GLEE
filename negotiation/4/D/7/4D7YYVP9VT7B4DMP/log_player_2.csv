"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true market value. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a lower price. I have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, so I'm not in a rush to accept."

Round 2

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? This is a reasonable compromise, and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this transaction.
