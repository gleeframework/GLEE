"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is far greater than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a strong offer that considers its potential impact on your business."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to a price we can both be happy with. Let's continue working together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Even though Bob has increased his offer considerably, we are still below John's offer. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate Bob closer to at least $1,400,000 before accepting."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price point. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $1,650,000. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're getting closer, but $1,650,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part and  is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob has now reached a price point that is close enough to John's offer. Accepting this offer mitigates the risk of further negotiation and secures a strong profit."
