"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects the significant value it will bring to your operations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is far greater than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a strong offer that considers its potential impact on your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to a price we can both be happy with. Let's continue working together to find a solution.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price point. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $1,650,000. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  we're getting closer, but $1,650,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part and  is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise here.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
