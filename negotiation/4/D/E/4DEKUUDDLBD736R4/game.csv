,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I'm placing on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price considering the value and my budget, and it would allow us to both benefit from the deal.  Let's get this done!",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $910,000 is still not quite meeting my needs. Let's compromise at $915,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finally close this deal.",915000.0,Alice,7,
