"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I'm placing on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I could sell to him now and get a decent profit, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or at least get closer to my goal in the next few rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $900,000 is getting closer to my goal, I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more. I have a few rounds left, and I'm confident that I can either get Bob to budge a bit more or sell to John for my full asking price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price considering the value and my budget, and it would allow us to both benefit from the deal.  Let's get this done! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $910,000 is closer to my goal, I believe I can still get a slightly better offer. I have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my target of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can either get Bob to budge a little more or ultimately choose to sell to John for my full asking price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $910,000 is still not quite meeting my needs. Let's compromise at $915,000.

With only two rounds remaining, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a better price from Bob, I'm satisfied with this outcome.  It's important to know when to walk away from a deal and secure the best possible outcome for yourself."
