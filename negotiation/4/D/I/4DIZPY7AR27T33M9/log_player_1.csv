Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
