Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $150 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than $100. 
* **Psychology:** A higher initial offer can make Bob perceive the product as potentially more valuable.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $150. However, this strategy gives you the best chance to maximize your potential profit."
