Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he's inclined to haggle, but still secures a significant profit for you. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 provides leverage. It's better to aim high with Bob first."
