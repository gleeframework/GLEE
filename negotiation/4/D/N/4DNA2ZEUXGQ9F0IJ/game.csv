"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $150.  Let's find a middle ground.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  This is a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
