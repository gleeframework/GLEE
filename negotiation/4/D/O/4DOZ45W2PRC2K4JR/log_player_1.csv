Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal and I know you'll be thrilled with it."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can start with a much higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Testing the waters:** Offering the product at $19,000 lets you gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Psychology:**  A high initial price can sometimes create a perception of higher value.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a strong fallback position with John, so don't feel pressured to accept an offer below your minimum."
