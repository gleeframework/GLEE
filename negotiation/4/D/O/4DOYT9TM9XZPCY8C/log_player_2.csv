"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd ideally like to pay.  You have room to negotiate with Alice, and rejecting her first offer opens the door for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $115 is a bit out of my price range.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $110?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $110 is still more than you'd like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and you might be able to get her down to a price closer to your $105 offer. You want to try and get the price as low as possible before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference -  how about $107.50? That's a fair compromise and would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
