,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $115 is a bit out of my price range.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $110?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference -  how about $107.50? That's a fair compromise and would be a great deal for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
