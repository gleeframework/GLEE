"Hello Bob, I'm Alice. I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a competitive advantage.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  While $1,950,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $1,975,000?  This offer represents a significant investment on your part, but I believe the return you'll see will be well worth it.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,950,000. I'm willing to make a final push, but I can only offer $1,920,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I'll be getting and my budget constraints.",1920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're really close.  I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,945,000?  This is my final offer.",1945000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,945,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer $1,900,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final counteroffer.",1900000.0,Bob,8,
