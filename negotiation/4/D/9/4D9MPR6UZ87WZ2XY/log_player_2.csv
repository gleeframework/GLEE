"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:While Alice's offer of $119 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you a chance to negotiate a better price or simply buy it from John and save a dollar."
