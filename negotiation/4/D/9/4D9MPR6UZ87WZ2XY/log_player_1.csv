Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While we want a high price, starting at $120 leaves no room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 gives us a safety net. We don't want to price it so high that Bob refuses, and we're forced to take a lower price from John.

By offering the product at $119, we:

1. **Increase the chances of Bob accepting:** It's a price that's beneficial to both parties.
2. **Maximize potential profit:**  We secure almost the full value Bob places on the product."
