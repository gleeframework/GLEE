Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, I can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing specific details that Bob could use to negotiate.
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in a discussion and potentially counter-offer, leaving room for negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still acknowledging the importance of securing a deal and not losing Bob as a buyer."
