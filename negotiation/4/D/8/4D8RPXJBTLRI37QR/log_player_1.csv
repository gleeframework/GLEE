``` 
 
This offer gives me a good chance of getting a price closer to my minimum, while still being attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation, but it also sets a firm starting point.  If Bob rejects, I can lower the price a bit, but I'll also be prepared to move on to John if the negotiation drags on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to go for the quick sale, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $7,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? This is still a great deal for you and allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but he's getting closer. I'll counter one more time to see if we can reach a compromise. I'm still holding out for a better price, but I'll need to be prepared to sell to John if Bob isn't willing to budge."
