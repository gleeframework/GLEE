"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Let's start with that number and see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $17,000. This is a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $17,000.  Let's split the difference and try $12,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob is moving closer to my price, and while $12,500 isn't ideal, it's better to secure a decent profit now than risk him walking away later.  It's a solid deal compared to potentially getting stuck in a stalemate."
