"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Let's start with that number and see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $17,000. This is a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $17,000.  Let's split the difference and try $12,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
