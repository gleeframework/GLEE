Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows for the possibility of Bob negotiating down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets more than $10,000.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, so she's not losing money if Bob declines."
