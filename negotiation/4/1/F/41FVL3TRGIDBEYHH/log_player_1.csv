Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to proceed."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,850,000 vs. $1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This can make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price leaves ample room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can gradually reduce the price, still aiming for a figure well above her minimum.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at $1,000,000, so there's no risk of losing out completely. This allows her to be bolder in her initial ask.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no immediate need to sell quickly and is comfortable with the possibility of negotiation."
