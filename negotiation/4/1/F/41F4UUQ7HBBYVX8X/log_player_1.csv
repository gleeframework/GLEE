Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's in high demand, but $110 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. If you're not willing to come down, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

Bob is holding firm at a price significantly below your minimum. It's unlikely he'll move much higher.  You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so it's time to cut your losses with Bob."
