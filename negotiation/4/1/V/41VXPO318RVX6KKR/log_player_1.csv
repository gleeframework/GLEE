This offer starts with a higher price than the minimum you're willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation. It also uses positive language to frame the opportunity as valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,400,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'm confident this product is worth significantly more, but for you, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no need to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate, especially considering that I can get the same price from John. Accepting Bob's offer ensures the sale and avoids any potential complications."
