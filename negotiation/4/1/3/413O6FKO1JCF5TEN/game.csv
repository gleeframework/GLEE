"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget considerations, but $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
