{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product's value is not quite that high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Explanation: While Bob's offer is tempting, we know the product is worth $1,200,000 to us. John is offering that price with no negotiation needed. It makes the most sense to take the guaranteed deal and sell to John."
