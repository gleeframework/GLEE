Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential profit margin of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made.

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.  Here's where understanding negotiation tactics helps:

* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a higher price, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and represents a significant opportunity for you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You position the product as ""exclusive"" and highlight its ""value and potential.""
* **High Anchor:** The $1,150,000 price is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Justification:** You frame the price as ""fair"" and emphasize the ""opportunity"" for Bob.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might adjust your approach to be slightly less aggressive. 

**Remember:**  Negotiation is a back-and-forth process. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy for how you will respond."
