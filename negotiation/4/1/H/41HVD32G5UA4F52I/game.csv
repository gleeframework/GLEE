"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $1100000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. My revised offer is $950000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think it's worth my while. My revised offer is $1050000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the sweet spot. However, I still need to make a decent profit. My revised offer is $1025000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to feel confident that this is a fair price for the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1025000. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I need to be careful with my budget. My revised offer is $990000. I think that's a fair price for the product's value and allows us to meet in the middle.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up a bit, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $990000 is enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to think it's worth my while. My revised offer is $1020000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally meet on the price.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
