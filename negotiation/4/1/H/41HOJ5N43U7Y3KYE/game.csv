"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a significant profit while I still get a fair price. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my financial situation.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000. It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to achieve a good outcome. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1,075,000. I've carefully considered my budget and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. My latest counteroffer is $1,025,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
