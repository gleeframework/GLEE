"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $18,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price and what John is offering. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum price ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. I want Alice to know I'm serious but also looking for a fair deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out the $6,000 figure, I'm attempting to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, $12,000 is still significantly higher than both my target price and John's offer.  I need to show Alice I'm willing to walk away if necessary to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I could go up to $7,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can do.  If we can make a deal at that price, I'm ready to buy today."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Firm:** I'm increasing my offer to show flexibility but setting a firm limit at $7,000. This signals to Alice that I'm serious but also close to my walk-away point.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Adding ""ready to buy today"" aims to incentivize Alice to close the deal now rather than risk further negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm still below my maximum of $8,000, giving me some wiggle room if Alice pushes back a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to compromise further. My counteroffer is $13,000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging on her price, and it's clear she's not going to come close to my $8,000 limit.  It's time to walk away. John is offering a much better deal, and there's no point in wasting more time negotiating with Alice."
