"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I accept $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still below my minimum price point.  Let's try $1,000,000. This price is fair, considering the value of the product to you.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be worth it in the long run.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
