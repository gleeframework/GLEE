Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to entice him to consider the offer.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a potential buyer, knowing that I can always sell to him for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

This initial offer allows for negotiation while still leaving me in a strong position to potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**
* **I have a strong backup option with John, who is willing to pay my desired price.** 
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to Bob.**

I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's not worth sacrificing my potential for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I accept $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm suggesting a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to make my offer seem more appealing.
* **Flexibility:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my bottom line.

By offering a price closer to Bob's, I'm increasing the chances of him accepting while still securing a price that's significantly higher than his initial offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for my desired price, providing me with a strong fallback position.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.

While $950,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's not enough to justify selling the product below my minimum threshold, especially when I have a guaranteed sale for a much higher price. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still below my minimum price point.  Let's try $1,000,000. This price is fair, considering the value of the product to you.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be worth it in the long run.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still protecting my minimum price.
* **Reemphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to strengthen the argument for a higher price.
* **Focus on the Long Run:**  I'm emphasizing the long-term value of the product to motivate Bob to consider the investment. 

This counteroffer strikes a balance between compromise and holding firm on my minimum price. I believe this offer increases the chances of reaching an agreement while still positioning me favorably."
