"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $14,000 is still too high for me. Could you do $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $9,000 is still quite low for me.  How about we settle at $12,000? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm trying my best to reach a deal with you.  I can go up to $10,000, but that's really pushing my limit. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
