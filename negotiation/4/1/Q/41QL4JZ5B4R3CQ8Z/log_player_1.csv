"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $14,000 is still too high for me. Could you do $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $9,000 is still quite low for me.  How about we settle at $12,000? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm trying my best to reach a deal with you.  I can go up to $10,000, but that's really pushing my limit. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to $15,000 within the remaining rounds to make continuing worthwhile. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best outcome for me at this point."
