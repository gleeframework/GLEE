Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (even though it's above his valuation), making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, ensuring you don't lose out. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
