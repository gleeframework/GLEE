"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by our previous customers. Given its quality and benefits, we believe it's worth more than $80. Considering your interest and the value this product holds for you, I'm offering it to you for $120. This price reflects the true worth and ensures you receive the best value for your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is more than Alice values the product at, it's still significantly less than your maximum budget of $150 and cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer represents a good balance of acquiring the product and saving money."
