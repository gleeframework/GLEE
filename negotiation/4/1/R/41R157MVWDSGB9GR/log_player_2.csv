"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,000. I believe it's a fantastic deal given its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000."", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual limit ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is way off.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere, but firm in stating that the initial offer is unacceptable. 
* **Leaving Room:** By saying ""closer to $6,000"" I avoid giving a hard limit, which could work against me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, to be honest, $11,000 is still outside of my budget.  I could potentially go up to $7,000, but that would be my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 7000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but by a smaller amount than Alice's decrease. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not going to be pushed too easily.
* **Near the Limit:** Offering $7,000 puts me close to my maximum. This signals to Alice that I'm serious but also sets a clear boundary.
* **""Absolute Limit"" Tactic:**  By stating this is my highest possible offer, I'm hoping to encourage Alice to make a more significant move if she wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $9,000?  This is a final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:** Alice stating ""$9,000 is a final offer"" suggests she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Over budget:** Even with her compromise, $9,000 is still $1,000 more than my maximum budget. 
* **John is reliable:**  I have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000, ensuring I stay within budget.

While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice not budging and me losing the opportunity to buy from John is too high."
