"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a higher profit.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This first offer is likely to be rejected as it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. However, it allows us to gauge how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $160, we have room to decrease the price in subsequent rounds if needed, making our offer appear more flexible and reasonable.
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep in mind our option to sell to John for $120. If negotiations with Bob are not progressing well, we can always walk away and take the guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is engaged:** Bob's counteroffer, while still below our minimum, indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's a significant gap between Bob's offer ($100) and our minimum ($120). By rejecting, we signal that his initial offer is too low and we're open to further negotiation.
* **John as a backup:** We don't need to accept a suboptimal offer from Bob immediately. We have the security of John's offer and several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you countering, Bob.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $130?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We want to demonstrate that we're negotiating in good faith by decreasing our price significantly from the initial offer. 
* **Aiming for Above Minimum:** While we're willing to negotiate, we're still aiming for a price above our minimum of $120. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer is a good test to see how flexible Bob is willing to be. If he rejects $130, we may need to consider moving closer to his price range or taking John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is above our minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Bob will move significantly closer to $120. Accepting now secures a profit and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation failing. 
* **Time Value:**  We're already in Round 4.  Prolonging the negotiation for a potentially small increase in profit isn't the most efficient use of our time."
