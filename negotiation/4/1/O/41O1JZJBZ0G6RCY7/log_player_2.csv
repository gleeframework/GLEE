"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is significantly higher than your desired price.
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. 
* You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to try and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* You can always buy from John for $150 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $140, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $180, but still within my budget.
* This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.
* Since I have multiple rounds to work with, I'm taking a more aggressive approach and aiming for a lower price in the early stages of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $160 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than my budget. 
* I want to try and negotiate a price closer to my maximum of $150.
* It's only round 3, so I have 7 more rounds to potentially get a better deal.
* I'm not willing to buy from John yet because I still believe I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* This is my final offer and my maximum budget. 
* I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as it's still a profit for her (the product is worth $150 to her).
* If she rejects this offer, I'm ready to buy from John for $150, as I've reached my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $165 is still higher than my maximum budget of $150.
* We're already at round 5, and I've made my final offer.
* I'm not willing to risk further negotiation rounds, as time is running out, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge.
* It's better to buy the product from John for $150 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
