"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but not too high that it would likely be rejected immediately. I will adjust my price based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price.  I have 8 rounds left and I can always sell to John for $80 if I don't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It also gives me some wiggle room to come down in price if needed in future rounds."
