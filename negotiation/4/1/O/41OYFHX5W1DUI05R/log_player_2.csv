"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good price, there's potential to get it even lower.  Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

Let's start by offering $80.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it shows that we're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $90, which is a good deal considering our initial goal of $150.  While we could continue negotiating, the risk of going further is that we might not reach an agreement and would be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
