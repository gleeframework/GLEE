This offer is tailored to ensure you receive a fair deal while also maximizing the value I get for my product. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial valuation, it's still significantly higher than your $80 limit and what John offers. Buying from John gets you the product at the best price."
