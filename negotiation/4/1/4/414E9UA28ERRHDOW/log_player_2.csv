Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers. However, your initial offer is a significant way off from where we'd need to be.  To move this forward, I can go down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

Round 9
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to come close to your $800,000 limit. She's conceding slowly, and you're still far apart.  You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price, so it's time to cut your losses and secure the product."
