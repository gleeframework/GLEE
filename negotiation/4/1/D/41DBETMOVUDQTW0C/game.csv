"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! This product sounds interesting, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested, though, and I'd be happy to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $13000.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $11500? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think the product's value is higher than $11500. I'm willing to come down another $500 and offer it to you for $12000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11000, which is closer to my initial offer. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $11000, which is $11500. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
