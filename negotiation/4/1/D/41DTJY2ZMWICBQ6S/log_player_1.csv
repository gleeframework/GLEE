Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique advantages, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is moving closer to our desired price, we have room to negotiate further.  We'll continue to inch down while gauging his reactions."

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, Bob has set a firm limit and we're already significantly above John's offer. Accepting $1,250,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
