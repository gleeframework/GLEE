Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $115 is a good starting point, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate down a little, still landing you a better profit than John's offer. 
* **Avoid Greed:**  If you start too high (close to $120), Bob will likely reject the offer outright. 
 
This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
