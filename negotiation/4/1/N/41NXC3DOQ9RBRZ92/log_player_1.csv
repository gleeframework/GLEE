Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial saving compared to our alternative buyer. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and presenting a ""limited-time offer,"" we create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  We don't know how much Bob is willing to negotiate. He might outright reject this offer, knowing we have a backup buyer.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, leaving the door open for further discussion could be beneficial in the long run."
