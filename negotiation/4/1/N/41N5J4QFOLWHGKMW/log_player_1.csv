Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($1,150,000) makes it attractive while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer quickly."
