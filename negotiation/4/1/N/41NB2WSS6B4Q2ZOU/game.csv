"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm looking for $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $10,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
