"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your fair pricing, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. I understand this might seem a bit lower than your initial offer, but I assure you, I am willing to pay a fair amount for the product. I hope you consider this proposal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't accept a price that low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can live with. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
