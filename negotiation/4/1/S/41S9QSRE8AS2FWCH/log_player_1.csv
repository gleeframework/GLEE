Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1400000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.

Bob's offer is too low.  I will try to get a better price from him.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can come to a compromise."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher amount.  I'll counteroffer him and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $1325000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1310000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's reach a final agreement that benefits us both.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the limited time and the risk of losing the sale to John.  I've managed to get a price higher than John's offer, and it's only slightly below my target.  It's time to finalize the deal and move on."
