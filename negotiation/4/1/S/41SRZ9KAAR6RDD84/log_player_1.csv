This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. I'm open to negotiation but will also be prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low.  

Let me know what Bob's response is, and I'll strategize accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is still a good deal for Bob considering he offered $15,000, and it's closer to my desired price point. I hope he'll accept, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."

Bob is unwilling to budge, and I've already made a significant concession. At this point, it's more valuable to me to guarantee the sale and get my minimum price. I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
