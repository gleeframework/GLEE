Round 8

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is the best price he's gotten from Alice, and it's exactly his budget.

Accepting Alice's offer guarantees he gets the product within his budget."
