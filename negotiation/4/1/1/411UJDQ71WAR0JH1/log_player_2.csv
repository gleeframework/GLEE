"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth $100 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $115. This is a great deal for both of us, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to pay $115 to Alice."
