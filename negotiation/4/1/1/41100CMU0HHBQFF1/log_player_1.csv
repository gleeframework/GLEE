Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you're interested in, for $100. It's a fantastic deal!"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so he's willing to pay anything up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $80 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $100, you're aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (saving him $20) while also securing a significant profit for yourself. 

This approach balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John."
