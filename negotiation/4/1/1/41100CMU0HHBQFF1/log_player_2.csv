"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you're interested in, for $100. It's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, you can potentially get it for less since you know Alice values it at $80 and you're willing to go up to $120. Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer within your budget."
