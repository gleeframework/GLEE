"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000.  This price reflects the benefit you'll get from owning this product and allows us both to come to a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's finalize this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel that we can find common ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. I believe this strikes a fair balance between the product's value and my financial constraints.",10500.0,Bob,4,
