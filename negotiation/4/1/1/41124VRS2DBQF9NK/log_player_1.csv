Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and highlights the potential benefit for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'm aware that the negotiation is ongoing and I will continue to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses. If he rejects, I will consider his counteroffer and potentially make a new one. I also remember that I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and John's offer. I'm not willing to settle for $10,000 yet. 

I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired outcome, aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. I'll also remind Bob of the product's potential value and the opportunity he's missing by settling for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000.  This price reflects the benefit you'll get from owning this product and allows us both to come to a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000** is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a higher price than Bob's offer. It also highlights the potential value to Bob and emphasizes the opportunity for both of us to benefit. 
* The message reinforces the benefits of the deal for Bob, encouraging him to consider my offer seriously.

**Important Note:** I am ready to accept Bob's offer if he counters with a price closer to $11,000. However, I'm still keeping John's offer in mind and am prepared to walk away if Bob continues to haggle at a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel that we can find common ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. I believe this strikes a fair balance between the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still too low for me. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still a significant loss for me considering John's offer of $15,000. I'm unwilling to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's a good chance we'll get stuck in an endless cycle of back-and-forth with no agreement. 

Selling to John guarantees a much higher profit and allows me to avoid further time-consuming negotiations.  It's the best course of action to maximize my earnings."
