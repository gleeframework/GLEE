{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob.**  Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is less than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  While John is willing to sell, the price of $12,000 is higher than Alice's offer. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $2,000 compared to buying from John."
