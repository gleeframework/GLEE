"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of your product, $1200000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can get closer to my desired range with further negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work for me.  I believe this price still represents a great value considering the product's potential. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and go with $1050000?  I'm confident we can both be happy with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price range, and I believe $1,050,000 is a good compromise.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John at $800,000."
