"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a very competitive price considering its unique value and potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.  There's no reason to accept it right away.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of your product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $1000000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1100000 to make this work for me.  I believe this price still represents a great value considering the product's potential. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,000,000.  Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  I'm confident we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
