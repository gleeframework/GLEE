"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price to consider it seriously. How about $1000000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm open to continuing the discussion.  How about we meet in the middle at $1125000?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
