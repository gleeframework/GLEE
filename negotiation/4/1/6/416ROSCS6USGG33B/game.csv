"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $120. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $120 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $100. It's a good price that's closer to what I was initially looking for, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",100.0,Alice,5,
