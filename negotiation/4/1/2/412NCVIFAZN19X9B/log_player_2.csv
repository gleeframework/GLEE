"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product to your business.  Let's make this deal happen.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. What do you say?

```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could get the product for $1,200,000 from John, Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still a reasonable price, considering the value of the product to him.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely if Alice decides to stop negotiating.  The potential savings of $125,000 is not worth the risk of losing the product."
