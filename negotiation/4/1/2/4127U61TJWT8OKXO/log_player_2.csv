"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's closer to his desired price point, and if he rejects it, there's no guarantee she'll go lower.  Since he has 7 rounds left and could potentially get a better deal, but there's also a risk of not closing the deal at all.  At this point, accepting the offer and saving $3,500 compared to John's price is a good compromise."
