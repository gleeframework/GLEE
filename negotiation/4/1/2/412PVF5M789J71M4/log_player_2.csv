"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000 on this product.  Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit far from your desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to his desired price, it's still higher than his limit. He can likely negotiate a lower price or purchase from John for a guaranteed $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. If we can't reach an agreement at that price, I'll have to consider other options.  "", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than his limit of $8,000. He's already demonstrated a willingness to walk away and has the option of buying from John for a guaranteed price. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further or if John is still available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000.  It's my final offer, and if we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has made it clear she won't go below $9,000, which is still more than Bob's budget.  John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is the best deal available to Bob at this point."
