Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I was hoping to keep the price below $130. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
 
While $125 is more than what John is offering, it's still less than my minimum goal of $120. I'll try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit lower than I can go right now.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
