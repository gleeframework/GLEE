{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $100,000 higher than her own valuation. 
* I have the potential to negotiate a lower price with Alice, and I want to explore that option before going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value you've expressed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $30,000 below my initial counteroffer and only $30,000 above my own valuation. 
* Accepting this offer saves me $120,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small, and the risk of losing the deal to John is high."
