"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you see its value. However, I need to make a profit, and $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $980000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000 and I'm willing to make a significant investment.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to make a significant investment, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to $1020000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a slight concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980000 and $1020000, which would be $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make another slight concession to $1040000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value to you.
