"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $120. You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already done some research and I know that similar products are selling for around $140. I can do $130 for you, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can still do better than $130.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you have room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a little high for me.  How about $115?  That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you $122.50. That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially continue negotiating, Alice is getting closer to your maximum price.  At this point, accepting the offer at $122.50 saves you money compared to buying from John."
