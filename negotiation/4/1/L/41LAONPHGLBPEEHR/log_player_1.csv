""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.  This price is attractive to Bob (saving him $10) and highly profitable for you (a $40 gain over your minimum). 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, but you have a buffer to work with.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $100 gives you leverage in the negotiation. You don't have to accept an offer below your minimum."
