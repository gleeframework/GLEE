Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $100 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it for more than $120 guarantees Bob will reject it, and you'll only make $80 from John."
