"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its potential, $1,600,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value to you is worth a bit more than $1,400,000. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but I can't go above $1,450,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product.  Let me know if this is a starting point for us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm thinking of $1,525,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my target. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to meet your target price, but $1,525,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the fair market value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
