"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, $900,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
