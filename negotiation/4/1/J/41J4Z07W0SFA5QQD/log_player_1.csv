Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without risking a rejection that might lead to a lower counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value for me, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price point. While it's above my minimum, I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing negotiations.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still leave you a good amount of value, and it's a price I can feel comfortable with.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
