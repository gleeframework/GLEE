"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value for me, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still leave you a good amount of value, and it's a price I can feel comfortable with.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
