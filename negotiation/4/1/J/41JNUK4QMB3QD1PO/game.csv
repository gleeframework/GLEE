"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $8,500, which is a significant discount from the original price. I think it's a fair offer considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $8,250. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a good value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to nudge my offer up a little.  How about $7,900? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8100.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm trying to make this work.  Could we settle at $8,000?  That's the most I can offer.",8000.0,Bob,8,
