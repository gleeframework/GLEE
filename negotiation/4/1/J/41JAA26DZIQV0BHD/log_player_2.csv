"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting offer is $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price ($800,000), which means there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer. There's a chance that Alice might be willing to accept a lower price, especially if she's motivated to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its value, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  What do you say? "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This makes it a reasonable starting point for further negotiation.  Bob is showing a willingness to compromise while also ensuring a significant saving for himself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $900,000? This allows for a healthy profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer from $950,000 to $900,000, but Bob is still aiming for a better price. There's still room for negotiation since Alice's minimum acceptable price is $800,000. By rejecting this offer, Bob can try to make a counteroffer closer to his desired price point. It's possible Alice will be willing to come down further to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $875,000 at this point.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically increasing his offer by a smaller amount this time, aiming to bridge the gap between his last offer and Alice's current offer.  He's still below Alice's current offer, but the message is designed to appeal to Alice's desire to secure a sale while still achieving a profitable outcome.  This is likely to make Alice more receptive to his offer."
