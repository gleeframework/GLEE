"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. You have leverage as you have a fallback option of buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11500. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $11,500 is still too high. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get closer to your target of $10,000. You have a strong bargaining position with the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product. However, I'm not ready to give up on the value I know this product can bring. I'm willing to meet you at $11250, which is a bit closer to my initial offer. This is still a great deal, considering the benefits the product offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than your target, it's only $250 more than your last counteroffer.  You're likely getting close to the lowest price she's willing to go.  At this point, it's probably not worth risking a further counteroffer and potentially losing the deal. You're still getting the product for less than John's price and within your budget."
