"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $710,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value I'm placing on it and the need to find a mutually agreeable solution. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",710000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $710,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $720,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",720000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $720,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $700,000. I'm prepared to offer $715,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",715000.0,Bob,6,
