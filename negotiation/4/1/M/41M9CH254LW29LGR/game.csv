"I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding value in the product.  While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to agree to, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what this product offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm eager to make a deal.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
