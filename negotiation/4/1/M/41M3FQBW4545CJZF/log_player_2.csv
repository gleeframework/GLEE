"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value to both of us. Given its importance and the benefits it offers, I propose a purchase price of $1,200,000. This amount reflects the product's true worth while allowing for a fair negotiation. I believe this price is well within the range that would make this transaction beneficial for both parties. Please let me know if you require further information or have any questions. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than John's $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation.  Alice clearly values the product significantly less than you do (she values it at $800,000 and you value it up to $1,500,000). By rejecting her initial offer, you open the possibility of getting a price closer to her true valuation."
