"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Leaving Room:**  The offer is $150,000 above my minimum, allowing for concessions during the bargaining process.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message aims to gauge Bob's initial reaction and understand his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price is fair given your estimated value of $800,000, and leaves room for profit for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly below his perceived value and my initial asking price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer to try and close the gap, keeping in mind I have the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my initial price. Would you consider $900,000? This still leaves you with a significant benefit considering the product's value to you."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've come down by $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying above the midpoint between his offer and my initial price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying a higher price.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** The counter-offer is still a strong position, showing I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your estimated value and still leaves me with a worthwhile purchase. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate further. While $875,000 is tempting, I'll hold firm for now. I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000 and believe I can achieve a better outcome by continuing the negotiation. I still have John's offer as a safety net if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $887,500?  It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while also working towards a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 887500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I've met Bob halfway between his offer ($875,000) and mine ($900,000). This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price point.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** Highlighting the win-win nature of the deal encourages Bob to accept and avoids a stalemate.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** The counter-offer maintains a firm but fair stance, reinforcing the product's value."
