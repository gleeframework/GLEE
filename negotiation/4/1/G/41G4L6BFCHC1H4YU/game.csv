"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is still below what I could get from John, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
