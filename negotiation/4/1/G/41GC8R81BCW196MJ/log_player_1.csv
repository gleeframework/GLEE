**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently incrementing his offers in smaller amounts.  This indicates he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. It's highly improbable that he'll reach close to $1,000,000.  Selling to John guarantees the maximum value and avoids further negotiation risk."
