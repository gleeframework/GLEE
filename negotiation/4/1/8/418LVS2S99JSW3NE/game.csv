"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is far below the value of this product to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product. Let's meet halfway.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant increase from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $950,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum threshold. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This allows me to cover some of my costs and you still get a valuable product for a reasonable price.  Let me know if you're interested.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still out of reach for me. I'm willing to pay $980,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me and allows you to cover some of your costs. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. $980,000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's reach a final agreement. ",1025000.0,Alice,7,
