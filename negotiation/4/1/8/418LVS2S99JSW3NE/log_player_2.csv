"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,000,000 is way above Bob's budget of $800,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is far below the value of this product to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product. Let's meet halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,200,000 is still outside of Bob's budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant increase from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on this product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $950,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum threshold. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This allows me to cover some of my costs and you still get a valuable product for a reasonable price.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still over Bob's budget. However, it's getting closer. Bob can continue negotiating and see if he can get a lower price. There are still a few rounds left and a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still out of reach for me. I'm willing to pay $980,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me and allows you to cover some of your costs. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. $980,000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's reach a final agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still too high for Bob.  Even though the negotiation is moving closer, it's getting tight on rounds. If Bob rejects the offer, he only has 3 rounds left to get a better deal. It's becoming increasingly likely that he won't be able to negotiate a price within his budget.  Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000."
