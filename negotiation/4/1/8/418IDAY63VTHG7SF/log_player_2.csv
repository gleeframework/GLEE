Round 7
Alice's offer:

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to budge much more, Bob. I can offer you $94, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You're running out of time and Alice is showing no signs of budging further. You're still too far away from your target price of $85, and the chances of Alice agreeing to that are slim. It's better to buy from John for $100 than risk ending up with a price you're not happy with or worse, having no deal at all."
