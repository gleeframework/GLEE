,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? This would still give you a great deal, and I'd be happy to sell it to you at this price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",125.0,Bob,4,
