{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is a good middle ground between my minimum of $80 and Bob's perceived value of $100.  This gives Bob a good deal and allows me to potentially make a profit.  I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a positive negotiation."
