"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can sell it to you for $112. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
