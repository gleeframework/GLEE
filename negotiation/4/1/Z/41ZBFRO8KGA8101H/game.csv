"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9000. It's a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $8750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8900. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $8000.",8900.0,Alice,5,
