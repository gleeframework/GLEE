Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price sensitive. If he rejects this offer, you're not losing much by selling to John for $120.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential to earn slightly more than your guaranteed sale price to John."
