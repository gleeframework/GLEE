"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800000 is a solid offer, it falls below what I believe the product's true worth to be.  I'm willing to compromise to make this work.  I'm prepared to accept $900000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our interests.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",900000.0,Alice,3,
