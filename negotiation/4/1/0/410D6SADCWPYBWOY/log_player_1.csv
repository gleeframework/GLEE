{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than my minimum but lower than Bob's maximum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also keeps the door open for a counteroffer and allows for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $125 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you consider $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what I would get from John, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $115? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
