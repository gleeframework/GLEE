Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth $100 to you, and to make this a good deal for both of us, I'm offering it to you for $90."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.  
* **Ensure a Profit:** Offering it for $90 guarantees a profit above your minimum acceptable price of $80, even if Bob negotiates down slightly.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 provides a safety net. This means you should aim higher with Bob."
