"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit well above my minimum.  This first offer is a strong opening move,  showing that I believe the product is valuable. I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more, especially since I have 8 rounds left.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if I can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for $1,750,000.  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to negotiate further. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep pushing."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though we're down to the wire, I want to see if I can get a bit more.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my last offer.  I only have 2 rounds left, but I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price."

This is the last round, and while I would prefer to get a bit more, it's too risky to reject Bob's offer.  I'll accept the $1,700,000 offer to avoid losing the deal completely and selling to John at a much lower price."
