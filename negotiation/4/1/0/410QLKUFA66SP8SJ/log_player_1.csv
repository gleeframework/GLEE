Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than my minimum value ($150) but still allows for room to negotiate and potentially earn more. This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  While $130 is lower than my minimum, it's still a starting point that gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Show flexibility:** By offering a price lower than my minimum, it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Secure a deal:** This price might be tempting enough for Bob to accept, especially considering it's higher than what the product is worth to him. 

If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer and potentially even accept a slightly lower price if it's close to my minimum. But I'll always keep in mind the option to sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is more than the product is worth to Bob, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Compromise:** It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum value of $150, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects again, I can further adjust the price to $120 or $125, but I will remain firm on not going below $110.

I will continue to monitor the situation closely and be prepared to accept a slightly lower price if it's close to my minimum value. But I will also be ready to sell to John for $150 if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'm not willing to sell for a price that low, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum. I'll counteroffer again and try to negotiate a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we meet halfway again at $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show persistence:**  It demonstrates that I'm still committed to reaching a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to give in to his last offer.
* **Offer a compromise:**  $105 is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still below my minimum value. It's a good compromise that could potentially lead to an agreement.
* **Leave room for a final concession:** If Bob rejects again, I can offer $110 as a final compromise. However, if he rejects that offer, I will sell to John for $150. 

I'm confident that this counteroffer will either persuade Bob to accept or bring us closer to a final agreement."
