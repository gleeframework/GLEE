"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still within your budget and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price.  There's a good chance you can negotiate lower than $1,200,000, as Alice's value for the product is $1,200,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than your initial counteroffer, it's still lower than her initial offer and lower than what you would pay John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a price closer to your desired $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still a good deal for you.  It's lower than what you'd pay John and it's getting close to your ideal price.  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further, leading you to have to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most financially sensible decision."
