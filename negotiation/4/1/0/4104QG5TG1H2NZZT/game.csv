"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $85 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $77.50 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm happy to close the deal at $82.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $82.50. I'm willing to go up to $79, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",79.0,Bob,6,
