"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is quite high.  I'm interested in the product, but  $600,000 is closer to what I have in mind.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair offer reflecting the true value of what's on offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, meeting in the middle is a good principle for negotiation.  To that end, I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,200,000. This reflects my desire to make a deal while recognizing the product's inherent worth.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
