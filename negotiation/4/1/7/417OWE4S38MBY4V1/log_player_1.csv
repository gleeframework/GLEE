"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $1,500,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm open to discussing further details and potential adjustments to the price based on your specific needs."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum valuation of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would secure a guaranteed profit, but I'd prefer to try and maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit below my desired value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the unique potential of this product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise and is only slightly below my desired minimum of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer guarantees a profit, and further negotiation might not yield a much better result. While I would prefer to continue negotiating, I want to minimize the risk of Bob backing out or finding another buyer."
