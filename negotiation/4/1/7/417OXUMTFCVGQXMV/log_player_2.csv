Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $850,000 is lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price still allows me to earn a fair return while giving you a significant opportunity.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $925,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $880,000?"", ""product_price"": 880000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your need for a budget-friendly price, but $880,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product. To ensure a fair deal for both of us, I'm offering a final price of $900,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go while still meeting my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $900,000, a full $300,000 less than John's price and $100,000 less than her initial offer.
* **""Final Price"" Signal:**  Alice has indicated this is her ""final price"".  While she might be willing to negotiate slightly more, it's unlikely you'll get a drastically better deal.
* **Time Investment:**  You've already spent 5 rounds negotiating.  Continuing might yield a small additional discount, but it also risks Alice sticking to her price or you running out of rounds. 

At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal or investing more time for minimal gain."
