"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. Would you like to purchase it at a special introductory price of $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. $140 is a good start, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price a bit?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's starting point. It leaves room for further negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying the product at a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about we agree on a price of $125 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's see if we can nudge her a little closer to my ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about $115? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference again. This keeps the negotiation moving while demonstrating I'm willing to compromise, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, how about we set the price at $120 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly anchoring on the $120-$125 range. While I could try to haggle further, the potential savings are getting smaller, and there's always a risk Alice won't budge. Accepting at $120 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of missing out on the deal altogether."
