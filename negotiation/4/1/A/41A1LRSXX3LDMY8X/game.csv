"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're hitting a bit of a standstill.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come up to $1,050,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more push, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
