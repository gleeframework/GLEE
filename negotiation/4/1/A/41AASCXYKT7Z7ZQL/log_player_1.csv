"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me a good profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $135 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm counteroffering with $170. It's a compromise, coming down from my initial $180 but still leaving me a decent profit. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring a fair price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $145. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and secures a sale.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether, and selling to John would only give me the minimum. It's better to take the $145 now."
