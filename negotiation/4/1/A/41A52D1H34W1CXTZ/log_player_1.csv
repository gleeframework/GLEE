```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  It's important to remember that my minimum acceptable price is $800,000, so I can always fall back to John if necessary."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's getting closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for $800,000."
