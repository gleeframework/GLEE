"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $10,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $11,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can make a deal!",11250.0,Alice,5,
