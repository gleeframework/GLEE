"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's valuation, giving me a chance to maximize my profit, but it's also lower than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, and I'm willing to pay $10,600 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I'm not quite ready to accept Bob's offer yet, but I'm also not ready to sell to John.  I'll see if I can get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping for a bit more, so how about we settle on $10,650? It's just a small step closer to what I'm hoping for, and it would make this deal worthwhile for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10650}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to pay $10,625 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both parties involved.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. It's a small difference, but I believe I can push for a slightly better price in the next round. I'll make a counteroffer, but if I don't get a better deal, I'll consider selling to John in the following round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hoping for $10,640. It's a small difference, and I believe it's a fair compromise. This would be a good deal for both of us, let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 10640}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've thought about it and I'm willing to pay $10,630 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,630. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,630
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $10 less than my minimum, and we're at the eighth round. I think it's time to take the deal.  I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating, but there's a chance that Bob will walk away and I'll be left with only John's offer. It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk losing out altogether."
