{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is less than what you'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice a price that's still above her minimum value but significantly lower than her initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's closer to my target price than her initial offer. I'm going to try and negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,300,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want to get a better price than her previous offer.  This is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,450,000 is still too high.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we'll get stuck in a back-and-forth with no resolution. Buying from John for $1,500,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget. It's a bit more expensive than I hoped, but it avoids potential delays and uncertainty."
