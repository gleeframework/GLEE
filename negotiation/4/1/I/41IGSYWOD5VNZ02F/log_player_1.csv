Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to part with it for $170. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the product is only worth $120 to Bob, you don't know that. By starting at $170, you're aiming to see if he's willing to pay more than its perceived value to him. 
* **Below John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John. By offering it to Bob at $170, you leave room for a potential profit above your guaranteed amount.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes no further rounds of negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee you'll be able to sell it to him."
