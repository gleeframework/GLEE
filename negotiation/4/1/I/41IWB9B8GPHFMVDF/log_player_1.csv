"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$70 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $100.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120. This is still above my minimum value of $100 but is a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to compromise and encourages him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offer, it's still below it.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss yet. I'll counter again to try and push Bob towards a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is right above my minimum value, showing Bob I'm serious about selling but also that I'm not willing to go lower.  I'm hoping this final push will convince Bob to accept."
