"Alice, your offer is way too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $800,000.  That's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, my original offer reflects the significant value it holds.  While I aim for a mutually beneficial agreement, I can't accept a price that low.  Could you consider $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the potential of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds that number. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a considerable compromise. I believe this price point reflects the true value and potential of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
