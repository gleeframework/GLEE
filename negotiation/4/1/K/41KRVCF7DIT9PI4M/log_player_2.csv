"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you. I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price still allows you to make a substantial profit while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen!
