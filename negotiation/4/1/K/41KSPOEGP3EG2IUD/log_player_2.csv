It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can likely get the price down closer to your $10,000 limit."

I'm starting with a lower offer of $9000.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  If Alice is willing to bargain, we can hopefully find a price that works for both of us."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but I'm closer to my limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further. I will make another counteroffer."

I'm going to offer $9500. This is a compromise between my last offer and Alice's latest price. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want to get the best deal possible."

Alice's offer is now at my limit. It's no longer worth continuing to negotiate, as I could just buy it from John at the same price."
