"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer and understand the value of the product. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $22,000 price point. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  However,  $13,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like to go.  Let's try $14,500.  That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I would like to counter with an offer of $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value and my budget.",14000.0,Bob,6,
