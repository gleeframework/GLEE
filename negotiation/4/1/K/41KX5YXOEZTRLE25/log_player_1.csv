"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives Bob a decent starting point, but it's also a price that I'm comfortable with.  I'll gauge his response and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer of $120, it's not a complete deal-breaker. I'll reject it and try to get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round to see if we can find some common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. It's a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's also a good compromise that might encourage him to come up a little. I'll see how he reacts and adjust accordingly for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a little more. I'll reject it and try to inch the price up further in the next round. I'm also considering the fact that I have limited rounds left, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130.  This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get us closer to a deal.  With only a few rounds left, I need to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my minimum, and with only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $125."
