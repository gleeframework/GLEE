"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in.  It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $117? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let me know what you think.",117.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $117 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $112. Can we discuss further?",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $112 is still a little too low for me.  Would you be willing to come up just a bit to $114? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close the deal this round.",114.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $114 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $108. Can we find a mutually beneficial price?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $108 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think we can both be happy with this price.",105.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm aware of your commitment to this product, and I respect your offer. However, I'm still looking for a slightly higher price. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $107. This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let's make this happen.",107.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I've reached my limit. I'd be willing to meet you at $105. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Bob,10,
