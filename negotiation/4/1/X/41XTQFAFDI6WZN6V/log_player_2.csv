(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and it's also lower than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000).  It's likely she'll accept a counteroffer closer to her value.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is still significantly lower than my maximum budget, but it's closer to Alice's perceived value of the product.  This should encourage her to continue the negotiation, and we can continue to work toward a mutually agreeable price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  $850,000 is still too high for me.  I will make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $900,000.  It was reasonable, considering Alice's willingness to negotiate and her stated value of the product.

One more counteroffer and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
