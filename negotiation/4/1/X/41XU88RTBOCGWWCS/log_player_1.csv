"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Building Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and unique opportunity, hoping to pique Bob's interest and make him more likely to negotiate.

**Important Note:**  While my goal is to maximize profit, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round. I still have a safety net with John's offer, so I can afford to be a little more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's fair considering the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price point and encourage Bob to consider the long-term benefits.
* **Framing the Offer:** I'm framing the offer as a ""significant discount"" to further incentivize Bob and make it appear more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer. I'm hoping that by continuing to reject, I can get Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,050,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm suggesting a price point that is exactly in the middle of our current offers. This shows a commitment to compromise and makes the offer seem reasonable.
* **Emphasize Value:** I continue to reinforce the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a worthwhile investment.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a significant compromise on my part to make it seem more attractive and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are in round 6 and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I've already made several concessions and it seems unlikely he will increase his offer significantly.  

It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which may result in a lower price or a wasted round."
