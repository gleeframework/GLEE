Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's fair considering the product's potential.
