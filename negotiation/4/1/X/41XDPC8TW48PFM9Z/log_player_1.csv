"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By aiming high initially, I leave room for negotiation while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Anchoring Bias:** The high initial price might psychologically influence Bob to perceive subsequent offers as more reasonable.
* **Alternative Option:**  The presence of John provides a safety net. If Bob's offers remain too low, I can always walk away and secure the $800,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, it's too early to settle. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore if I can secure a better deal. Rejecting his offer now allows me to counter and potentially push the price higher in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I believe my initial offer reflects the true value and potential this product holds. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident it represents a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:**  I am making a significant price drop to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but I am holding firm above Bob's initial offer to signal that his first offer was too low. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value emphasizes why my price is justified and aims to nudge Bob towards a higher valuation.
* **Maintaining Space:**  By offering $1,000,000, I am still leaving room for further negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and is moving closer to a price point I find acceptable. While $950,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds.  The risk of losing the deal entirely to John is still relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer demonstrates a strong willingness to close the deal while still aiming for a price above Bob's last offer.  
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing it as a final compromise, I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency without resorting to hardball tactics. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $975,000 still represents a significant profit margin, exceeding my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach a fair agreement. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $960,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both of our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $960,000 is a very good offer, exceeding my minimum acceptable price by a significant margin.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains, with the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds. 

While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the potential gain is not worth risking the loss of a very favorable deal that is already on the table."
