Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some potential for a win-win situation. 
* **Appealing to Value:**  I highlight the product's value to Bob, reminding him that he sees it as worth $150. This reinforces the idea that the price is still a good deal for him.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with an open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:**  $110 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and only $10 less than my initial offer. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away entirely or lowering his offer even further. Accepting his offer secures a sale at a decent price.
* **Time Value:**  By accepting the offer, I avoid the risk of wasting time with further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
