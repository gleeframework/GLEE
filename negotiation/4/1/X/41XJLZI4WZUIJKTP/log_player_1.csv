Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while ensuring we still make a profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $135 or $140) while still keeping you above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no risk of losing money."
