"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is enticing, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1000000.  That would be a win-win for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is still too low for me. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
