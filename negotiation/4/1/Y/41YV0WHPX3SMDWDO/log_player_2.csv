"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $100 from John.  While Alice's offer of $80 is tempting, there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his $100 limit as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $70 is a reasonable move. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is still above Bob's $100 limit.  However, it's closer to his budget than John's price, making it worth continuing the negotiation.  Bob can likely secure a lower price by continuing to make counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his last offer of $70 and Alice's current offer of $85.  Offering $75 shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a better deal. This gives Alice a chance to compromise while staying above Bob's $100 limit from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still above Bob's ideal price but is getting closer to his limit.  With only 5 rounds left, it's a gamble to keep negotiating.  The risk of Alice rejecting further offers and Bob losing the chance to buy from John is too high.  Accepting the offer at $90 secures the product while still saving $10 compared to buying from John."
