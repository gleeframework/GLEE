I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if necessary.  If Bob rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust my strategy accordingly."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to counteroffer at $12,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, while still staying above my minimum price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

I'm making a final counteroffer at $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and I'm hoping Bob will agree. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for the same amount."
