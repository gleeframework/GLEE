Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's maximum valuation is impossible:** In a real negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($8,000). 
* **Starting high anchors the negotiation:**  By starting with a price higher than even your minimum acceptable price, you give yourself room to negotiate downwards if needed and create the perception of value. 
* **Limited-time offer creates urgency:**  This encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid missing out on what you've presented as a good deal.
* **John acts as your safety net:** You know you can sell to John for your minimum price, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. Remember, any price above $15,000 benefits you in this scenario."
