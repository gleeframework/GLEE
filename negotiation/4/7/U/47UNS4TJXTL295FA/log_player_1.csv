While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $880,000 is the most strategically sound option at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** $880,000 is a substantial profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob has been consistently increasing his offers, indicating a strong desire for the product. However, his increments are getting smaller.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation for a potentially small increase in price carries the risk of Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer in later rounds. 

Accepting now secures a great deal and avoids potential downsides of a protracted negotiation."
