Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  I believe it will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's potential to get even more from Bob. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high creates room for negotiation and leaves Bob with a sense that there's a deal to be made. 
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential"" helps justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially offering"" subtly implies that the price is open to discussion. 
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while also ensuring the sale doesn't fall through and you have to settle for the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
