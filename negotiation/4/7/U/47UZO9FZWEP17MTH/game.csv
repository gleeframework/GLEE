"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $9,750?  That's a significant move on my part.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm not quite ready to accept $9,750.  How about we split the difference at $10,125?  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. ",10125.0,Alice,5,
