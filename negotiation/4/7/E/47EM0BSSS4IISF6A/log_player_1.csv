Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $12,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's also lower than Bob's perceived value, so there's room for him to counteroffer and potentially settle on a price that benefits both of you. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  By sending an offer instead of just stating your minimum, you signal that you're open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $11,000 at this point.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
