"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

You can save money by negotiating with Alice.  $12,000 is still a good deal, but there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, $11,000 is a good price, and it's likely Alice won't budge further.  It's a good compromise that saves you $4,000 compared to buying from John."
