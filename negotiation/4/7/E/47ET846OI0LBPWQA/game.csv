"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its actual value.  Would you consider a price of $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $14,000? It's a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and it's still a great deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value to me. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your target price, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you at $12,500. This is a fair price that balances our interests and gives you a good deal on the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
