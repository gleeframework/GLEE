"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we start at $10,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit high for me. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250. This would be a good deal for both of us and avoids the need to involve John. What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,4,
