"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that can significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and benefits, I propose a price of $12,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your budget.** You're looking to spend no more than $10,000, and Alice is asking for $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a lower price, especially since you're willing to walk away and buy from John. 
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer.** This gives you the opportunity to set a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still shows you're serious about buying. It leaves room for compromise.
* **Justification provided:**  The message explains why you're counteroffering and sets a clear starting point for negotiations. 
* **Focus on the value to you:**  You're highlighting the value to you, which is relevant in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while addressing your concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** While closer to your target, $10,500 is still more than you want to spend.
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  You've shown your willingness to walk away, so there's likely room for Alice to come down further.
* **Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer.** You can try to close the gap and get a price closer to your $9,500 proposal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is your absolute maximum, showing you're serious about closing the deal while staying within your budget.

* **Finality:**  By stating it's your ""absolute maximum,"" it creates pressure on Alice to make a decision."
