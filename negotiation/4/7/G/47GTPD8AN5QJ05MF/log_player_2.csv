"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely get a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 just isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is $110, which is still below your maximum price of $150.  It's also a significant improvement from her previous offer of $125. Accepting this offer saves you $40 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your next counteroffer and you'll end up paying the full $150 to John."
