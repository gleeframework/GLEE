Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $125 gives me some wiggle room to potentially lower the price if Bob counteroffers. 

This initial offer balances the need to maximize my profits with the desire to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired minimum of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  There's still a chance Bob might be willing to pay more to get the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 just isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $110 is halfway between my minimum ($100) and Bob's offer ($105). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is still a good deal for Bob, hoping to increase his motivation to accept. 
* **Staying Firm on Value:** By refusing to go below $110, I'm asserting the value of the product while remaining open to negotiation."
