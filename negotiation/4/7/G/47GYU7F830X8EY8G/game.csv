"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $10,000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm really looking to spend no more than $8,500.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's a fair price, and I think it still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900. That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's try to reach an agreement.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still hoping to get the product for $8,500, but I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $8,750 is still too low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,850? It's a fair price, and it lets us both close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",8850.0,Alice,7,
