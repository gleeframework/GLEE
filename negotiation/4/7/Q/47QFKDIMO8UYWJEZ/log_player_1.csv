This offer starts at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses a positive sentiment to potentially encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll try to get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John."

Bob's offer:

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my goal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
