Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief justification (even if vague) can sometimes make the offer feel more palatable.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects it, you can always lower the price or move on to John, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80."
