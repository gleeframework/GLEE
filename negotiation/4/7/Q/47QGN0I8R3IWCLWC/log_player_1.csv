{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit above your minimum, but it allows for some negotiation room.  I'm also emphasizing the value to Bob, hoping to make the deal more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I'm not ready to sell to John yet, I'm also not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
