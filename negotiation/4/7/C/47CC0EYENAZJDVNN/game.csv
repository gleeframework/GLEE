"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your proposal, it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $900000. I'm willing to make a compromise and sell it to you for $1050000. This price still reflects the product's value while also being a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm able to offer at this time. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $950000.  This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $950000. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $1025000. This price is closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's value and my minimum selling price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I see we're getting closer, but $1025000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm ready to offer $975000 for the product. This price demonstrates my commitment to acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. ",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to reach my minimum price. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $1000000, which is the same price I offered in the first round. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we've both been flexible throughout this negotiation, and I respect your position.  However, $1000000 is still out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $990000.  This is a fair reflection of the value of the product and demonstrates my genuine desire to complete this purchase. I'm confident this offer is a mutually beneficial solution that allows us both to walk away happy.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting too close to the wire. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1000000. However, I'm willing to make one last offer: I'll sell it to you for $995000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to make a decision now.",995000.0,Alice,9,
