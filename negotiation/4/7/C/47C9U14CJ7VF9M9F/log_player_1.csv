Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $119. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $120.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Bob to buy the product for as high a price as possible without exceeding his perceived value.  By offering the product at $119, you're aiming for the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob:

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is just below his maximum perceived value. 
* **Maximizes Profit:** If Bob accepts, you make a $19 profit, which is better than the $0 profit you'd make if he rejects your offer and you sell to John.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can sell to John without any losses."
