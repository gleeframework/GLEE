"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That would be a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my expenses and still provide you with a valuable product. Let's finalize this deal. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,
