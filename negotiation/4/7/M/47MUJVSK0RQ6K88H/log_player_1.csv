Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your baseline.
* **Justification for the price:** By mentioning the product's value and an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you're framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary. 
* **Leaving the door open for negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you invite him to counter-offer and engage in negotiation, potentially leading to a price higher than $800,000. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a fair deal if he's willing to meet you somewhere above your minimum."
