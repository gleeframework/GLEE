Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still potentially exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Bob may try to negotiate the price down. By starting higher, you have some buffer to potentially meet in the middle while still making a significant profit.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and your belief in a ""fair deal."" This confidence can make Bob more inclined to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:**  While this is a starting point, be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and any further information you gather during the negotiation."
