"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1,275,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
