"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional value considering its worth of $10,000 to you. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'd like to offer $8,500.  This is still a great value for me, and it leaves some room for you to make a profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I need to maintain my minimum profit margin. I am willing to consider $8,750 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while providing a good deal for you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is now offering the product for $8,750, which is lower than John's $10,000 price. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further. If Bob rejects and makes a counteroffer, Alice might refuse and he'll be stuck buying from John at a higher price. 
* **Still a good deal:** $8,750 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his maximum price and leaves some room for profit for Alice.  

It's better for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
