Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $5,000?  That seems like a fair price."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too far below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, her latest offer is still $500 more than John's offer. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will get her price down to $8,000 or less.  It's in Bob's best interest to secure the product at the best known price."
