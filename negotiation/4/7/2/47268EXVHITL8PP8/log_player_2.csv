"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable to you. I'm asking for $95, but I'm open to negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and $100 to you. Alice's offer of $95 is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $90?  That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves room for you to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my value of $100, I still want to see if I can get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation."
