Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit above my minimum ($12,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate, so I can confidently aim high with Bob."
