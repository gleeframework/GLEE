"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob more receptive to counteroffers that are still profitable for you.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high price leaves plenty of room for negotiation over the next 10 rounds. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value, conveying confidence in your position. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  Potentially secure a deal much closer to your asking price.
2. **Gauge Bob's Willingness:**  His response will give you insight into his eagerness and flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and your initial asking price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  It's important to demonstrate that you won't settle for a price far below your product's worth. By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about negotiating within a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I can offer it for $1,400,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential the product offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility by significantly decreasing from the initial price. However, it remains  well above both your $1,200,000 minimum and Bob's offer, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out numbers; you're reiterating the product's worth to justify the higher price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge how serious Bob is and help determine his potential price ceiling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still pretty far apart.  I can go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below your $1,200,000 minimum.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's important to signal to Bob that you're willing to walk away from the deal if it doesn't meet your valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but the gap between our positions remains substantial. I'm willing to make a significant move to $1,250,000, but I need to see some movement on your side as well. This offer is a firm reflection of the value this product delivers."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Near Minimum, Firm Stance:**  This offer is now very close to your absolute minimum.  By stating it's a ""firm reflection of value,"" you convey seriousness and a limit to further concessions.
* **Pressure on Bob:**  The message emphasizes the need for Bob to reciprocate with a significant increase in his offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  With half the rounds remaining, you're starting to apply time pressure, implying that you might accept John's offer if an agreement isn't reached soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I need you to meet me closer to my price.  I can do $950,000, but that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. Here's why:

* **Minimal Movement:** Bob's offer is only slightly better than his previous one, showing reluctance to bridge the significant gap between your positions.
* **Below Minimum:**  Even with his increase, Bob's offer is still substantially below your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price. There's no need to accept a loss when you have a secure alternative. 

By selling to John, you guarantee your desired profit and avoid the risk of further low offers from Bob."
