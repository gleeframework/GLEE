"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking with $90, but that's just not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a good deal for both of us, as I'm getting closer to your offer, and you're getting the product for a price lower than my original offer. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle.  How about we settle on $92? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $92 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $94?  It's a fair price that's closer to both of our expectations.  Let's close this deal!",94.0,Alice,7,
