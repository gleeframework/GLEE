Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Think about it, and let me know what you decide.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I understand your budget constraints, $8200 is still too far off from my desired price.  How about we meet at $8700?  This allows me to take a small loss, but it also gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  What do you think?
