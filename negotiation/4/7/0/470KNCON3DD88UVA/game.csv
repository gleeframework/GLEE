"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1400000. Can we discuss further?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not comfortable going above $1400000. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we do it at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
