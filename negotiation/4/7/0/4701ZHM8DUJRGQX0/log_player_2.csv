"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know its value to you is high, so I'm starting with a price of $17,000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price but still within a reasonable range. This approach helps us gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a good deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. That's a fair price, considering the value of this product to you. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to our desired price, but we're still above John's offer. Let's see if we can negotiate further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,250? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 14250
}
```

We're suggesting a price exactly between our last offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14,250 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $14,750. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but we're still paying a premium over John's price.  We'll make one more attempt to get closer to $14,000 before taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying hard to make this work, but $14,750 is pushing my budget.  How about $14,100? This is a very competitive offer, and I'm eager to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 14100
}
```

We're making a smaller counteroffer now, showing Alice we're serious about a lower price but still willing to negotiate.  We're getting close to John's offer, so Alice needs to make a compelling case to justify going above $14,000."
