"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. That's a fair price, considering the value of this product to you. Let's see if we can close the deal.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,250? I think that's a fair compromise.",14250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,250 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $14,750. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",14750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying hard to make this work, but $14,750 is pushing my budget.  How about $14,100? This is a very competitive offer, and I'm eager to close the deal.",14100.0,Bob,6,
