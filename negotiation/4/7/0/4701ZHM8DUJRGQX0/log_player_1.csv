Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know its value to you is high, so I'm starting with a price of $17,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I will reject it.  I will counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. That's a fair price, considering the value of this product to you. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,250? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $15,000.  I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,250 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $14,750. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying hard to make this work, but $14,750 is pushing my budget.  How about $14,100? This is a very competitive offer, and I'm eager to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and with only 4 rounds remaining, I'm not confident that we can reach a deal that meets my needs. It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
