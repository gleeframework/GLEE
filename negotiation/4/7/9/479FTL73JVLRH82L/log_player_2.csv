Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $775,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $790,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

At this point, Alice has come down considerably in price. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, we're running the risk of her becoming firmer in her position or us running out of rounds.  $790,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer."
