Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. If he immediately accepts, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can then negotiate down towards your minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, who is willing to pay your minimum price. This knowledge empowers you to be firmer in your negotiations with Bob."
