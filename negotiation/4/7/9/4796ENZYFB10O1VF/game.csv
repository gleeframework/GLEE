"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $1200000. Let me know if you're interested!",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested!",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1650000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1650000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1680000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested!",1680000.0,Alice,5,
