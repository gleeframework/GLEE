"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering its unique benefits.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While $1,400,000 is closer, I still need the price to be lower. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large.  I'm open to finding a middle ground, but I need to see a significant move on your end.  I'm willing to consider $1,300,000.  Keep in mind, I have other interested parties, but I believe this product would be a great fit for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand the product's value and I am serious about buying it, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. To be completely transparent, I have another option at $1,000,000.  To avoid going with the other option, I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
