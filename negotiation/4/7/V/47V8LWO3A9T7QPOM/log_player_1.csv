Round 2
Bob's offer:

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While $1,400,000 is closer, I still need the price to be lower. How about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. While his offer is increasing, the increments are too small to continue engaging at this pace. We need to signal we're willing to walk away to see if he gets more serious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large.  I'm open to finding a middle ground, but I need to see a significant move on your end.  I'm willing to consider $1,300,000.  Keep in mind, I have other interested parties, but I believe this product would be a great fit for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** We're coming down in price, but only slightly. This signals that we're serious about the $1,200,000 baseline.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We mention ""other interested parties"" to remind Bob that we have options and he's not the only potential buyer. 
* **Encouragement:**  Despite the firmness, we still want Bob to think a deal is possible with a stronger offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value and I am serious about buying it, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. To be completely transparent, I have another option at $1,000,000.  To avoid going with the other option, I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his final offer, indicating he's unlikely to move significantly higher. 
* **Unacceptable Price:** Even with his ""final offer,""  $950,000 is still substantially below our $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **John as a Guarantee:** We have a guaranteed offer from John for our desired price. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob when we have a sure thing."
