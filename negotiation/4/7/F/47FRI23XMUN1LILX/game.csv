"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7,500. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal considering its true value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
