"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",
 ""product_price"": 1300000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with an ambitious offer significantly above both our minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** We frame the high price by emphasizing the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential return on investment,"" aiming to appeal to Bob's desire for a valuable asset.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By anchoring the negotiation with a high number, we aim to influence Bob's perception of the product's worth and potentially secure a higher final price, even with concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum and John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate and will aim to bring Bob closer to our target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget considerations, the value of this product is truly exceptional. Let's meet in the middle - I propose $1,150,000."",
 ""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:**  We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and make a significant concession to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still substantially above both his offer and his perceived value, maintaining pressure.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Framing:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" we create an illusion of fairness while still anchoring the price closer to our target.
* **Continued Value Emphasis:**  We reiterate the ""exceptional"" value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits and justifying a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully and I would like to counter with an offer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above our guaranteed sale price with John ($1,000,000) and provides a good profit margin.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing negotiations with no guarantee of reaching a better price introduces risk and delays receiving payment. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome.
* **Limited Upside:** While we might push Bob slightly higher in further rounds, the potential gains seem outweighed by the risks of him lowering his offer or us missing the deal altogether."
