,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $130? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  This is the best I can do.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $125 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
