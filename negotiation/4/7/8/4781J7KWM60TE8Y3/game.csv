"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000 to make this deal happen.  This price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to achieve my desired price point. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,110,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a good deal for both parties.",1110000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,110,000 is still just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,115,000.  This price is a good compromise for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1115000.0,Alice,5,
