"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $14,000. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $15,500. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,
