"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $10,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try to meet even closer to my budget at $9,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
