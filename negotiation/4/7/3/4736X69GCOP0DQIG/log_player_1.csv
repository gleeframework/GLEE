Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a $5 discount, making it likely he'll accept while maximizing your profit.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects, you still have John who will buy it for $80, ensuring you don't lose out."
