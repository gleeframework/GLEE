"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
