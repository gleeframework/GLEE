"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. By rejecting, Bob opens the door to negotiation and potentially getting a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but my limit is $10,000. Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target, he can still get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay more at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit above what I can manage. I'm willing to go up to $10,250.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to reduce the price further, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. I'm offering the product to you for $10750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $10,750 is still higher than what John is offering.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, there's also a risk she'll stall or counter with an even higher price.  It's better to lock in the guaranteed $10,000 price from John rather than risk losing time and potentially paying more."
