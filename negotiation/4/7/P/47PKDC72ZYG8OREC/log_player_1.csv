Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking $95 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $95 is a good starting point. It's closer to Bob's value of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation and profit for me.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message shows I'm open to a deal and not just trying to squeeze every dollar out of him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states I'm open to hearing his thoughts, encouraging him to counteroffer if he wants. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation and a possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  My minimum selling price is $80, and Bob's offer of $85 is only slightly above that.
* **Potential for More:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $80 is a safe option, it would mean leaving money on the table. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to secure a better price closer to my initial asking price of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $90 is a compromise between my initial $95 and Bob's $85 offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit than John's offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" and a ""good deal"" for both of us. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to see the value in accepting.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $90 is still higher than my minimum, giving me room to potentially come down a bit more if needed. 

This strategy aims to reach a middle ground with Bob while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $87 is only $7 below my initial asking price of $95 and only $3 below my previous offer. This is a good result considering the potential for further negotiation to go south.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject his offer and try to counteroffer again, there's a risk he might walk away, leaving me with only John's $80 offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time, and while I could potentially earn a few more dollars, the extra time could be spent on other opportunities.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale with a profit of $7 above my minimum price, which is a good outcome given the current situation."
