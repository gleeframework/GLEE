Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price."
