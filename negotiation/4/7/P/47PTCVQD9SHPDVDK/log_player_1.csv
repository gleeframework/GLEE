Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, there's no incentive to offer a price lower than that to Bob.
* **Leave no money on the table:**  Starting at your desired price allows you to gauge Bob's interest without leaving potential profit untapped. He might accept the offer outright. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While this offer starts at the highest point, it leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer. You can then decide if a slightly lower price (but still above your minimum) is acceptable."
