"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While it seems like a great opportunity, I'm looking to secure it at a price closer to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however,  $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's agree on $1,100,000, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000?  This seems like a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is close, I need to stay firm at $1,090,000 for a deal. I'm confident this will be a wise investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is very close to Bob's desired price of $1,075,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price within his budget and saves him from having to buy from John at a higher cost."
