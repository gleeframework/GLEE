Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,700,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  I understand the product is worth less to you, but I believe the potential benefits outweigh the cost.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. "", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:**  $1,700,000 is still significantly less than my minimum value of $1,500,000. This gives Bob room to potentially make a profit if he finds a way to leverage the product. 
* **My Backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,500,000, so I'm willing to take a small risk to see if I can get a slightly higher price from Bob. 
* **Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to discuss the offer. This leaves room for negotiation if he counters with a lower price.

**Important Note:**  This offer assumes that Bob's value for the product is fixed and there is no chance of changing that value through negotiation.  If there is room for me to influence his perceived value (e.g., by highlighting hidden benefits), I would adjust the offer accordingly."
