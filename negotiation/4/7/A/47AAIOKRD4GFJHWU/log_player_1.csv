Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a price of $2,000,000 reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Testing the Waters:** A $2,000,000 offer gauges Bob's interest and potential to exceed your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value (""significant value,"" ""reflects its worth""), you provide a reason for the high price, making it seem less arbitrary.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards, but it's much harder to go up from a low starting point."
