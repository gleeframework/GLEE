"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and features. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, and understand your perspective on the price. However, $18,000 is considerably below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $20,000. This is my final offer."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $17,500 is getting closer to a tempting offer, we still have rounds to negotiate and Bob is clearly interested. Holding firm at this stage might encourage him to come closer to $20,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  To be fair to us both, I'm willing to accept $19,000.  This offer reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your interest.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this stage, we need to show Bob we're willing to negotiate but also maintain a price above John's offer. Dropping to $19,000 is a significant move and might be enough to close the deal without risking further counteroffers going below our acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product but also has a firm budget.  While we could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, accepting $18,500 guarantees a sale above our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely.  It's a good balance of profit and deal closure."
