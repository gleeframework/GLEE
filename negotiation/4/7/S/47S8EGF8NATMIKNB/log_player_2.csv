"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $115. I think you'll find it's a great value for what it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($85) to give myself room for negotiation. This anchors the price lower in Alice's mind.
* **Leaving Room:** Even though my target is $100, I'm offering less to allow for potential counteroffers from Alice.
* **Polite and Open:**  I'm maintaining a polite and friendly tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a great price for a product you value at $100.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my target price of $100. There's no point in rejecting this offer and risking a higher counteroffer or a breakdown in negotiations. I'll accept the deal and save money compared to John's offer."
