{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation and still gives Bob a good deal since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this product is worth less to me than you do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely secure a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. How about we try to get closer to my initial target price? I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my desired price point and is a good compromise. It's a strong deal for me, especially considering the risk of having to sell to John for a much lower price. I'm going to accept his offer and finalize the sale."
