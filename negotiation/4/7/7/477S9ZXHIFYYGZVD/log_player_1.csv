Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a more competitive price.  While I value this product highly, I'm willing to move closer to your offer.  How about we settle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're aiming for the highest possible price. By countering, we signal that we're willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $1,350,000 is a compromise between Bob's offer ($1,300,000) and our initial ask ($1,400,000). 
* **Maintaining Margin:**  This price still keeps us comfortably above our minimum ($1,200,000), ensuring a good profit."
