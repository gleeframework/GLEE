"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than the product's value to her ($1,200,000), but still lower than your maximum budget ($1,500,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a more competitive price.  While I value this product highly, I'm willing to move closer to your offer.  How about we settle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within my budget and a good compromise.  It's also closer to my counteroffer of $1,300,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer, and I might end up buying from John at a higher price."
