"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget, there's no benefit to negotiating further.  Buying from John at the same price guarantees you the product without the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might result in a higher price or a failed deal."
