"Hey Alice, that's a great offer, but I'm really only looking to spend around $80. Would you be willing to go lower?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $95, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
