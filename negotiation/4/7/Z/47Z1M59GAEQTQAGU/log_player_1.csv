"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's value of $80 but below my minimum of $120. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still leaving the potential for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 just doesn't work for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to $90. How about $88? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find this product valuable at that price."", ""product_price"": 88} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $86. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although $86 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum of $120 and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer will guarantee a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for $120. It's a reasonable compromise and allows me to secure a sale without further negotiation."
