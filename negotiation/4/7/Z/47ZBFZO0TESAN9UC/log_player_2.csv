# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price tailored for you. Considering its value to you, we propose to sell it to you for $12000. This offer reflects its worth while allowing you to acquire it at a favorable price. We believe this is a win-win opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy."
