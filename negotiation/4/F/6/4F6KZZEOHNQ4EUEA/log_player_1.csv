Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a premium price of $12,000. I believe in its value and think it would be highly beneficial for you. However, I do have other interested buyers, and if this price doesn't suit you, I'll understand."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers to justify the high price. This creates a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially landing on a price between $8,000 and $12,000. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this high price, but it maximizes your potential profit if he does."
