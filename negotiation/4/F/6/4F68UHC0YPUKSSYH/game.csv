"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is still a good price for you, and it gives me some room to make a profit. Let's see if we can work together on this.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
