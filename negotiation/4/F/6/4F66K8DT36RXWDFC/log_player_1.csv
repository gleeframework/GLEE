Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to propose adjustments."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start high. A price of $1,400,000 aims to capture some of the value the product holds for Bob while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting that Bob has the first opportunity adds a sense of urgency and potential loss aversion if he doesn't act. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates flexibility and willingness to discuss the price, making Bob more likely to engage.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while maintaining a professional and respectful approach."
