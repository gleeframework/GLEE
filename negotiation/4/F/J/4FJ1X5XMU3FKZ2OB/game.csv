"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,000. Would you consider $7,100?",7100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,100. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $7,300. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.
