Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's highly valuable and I know you'll benefit from it."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $150, we want to maximize our profit. Offering it slightly below his maximum valuation increases the likelihood of a sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John provides a safety net. We don't want to offer the product to Bob for less than this amount."
