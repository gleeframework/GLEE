{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, knowing it's more than what Bob values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob may make him more likely to consider a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for counteroffers and gives me the opportunity to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John as my backup buyer, giving me the option to end negotiations if they don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, which suggests he might be willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'm not going to accept his offer yet. I'll use the next round to counter with a price that is closer to my target but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'd be happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by making a counteroffer.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This shows flexibility and signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Continuing to use a friendly and positive tone can help keep negotiations amicable.
* **Reiterating Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value to him may help sway him towards my offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.  
* **John as Backup:**  I'm still keeping my options open with John, giving me the power to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, making it risky to accept a price this low.
* **Negotiation Continued:**  While Bob's offer is lower than I'd prefer, he's clearly still interested. This means there's potential for a better deal in the next round.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my target while still leaving room for compromise.

**Counteroffer Strategy:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price slightly lower than $11,000,  perhaps $10,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also keeps the price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to make a final concession. How about we settle on $10,500? This price reflects the value of the product while staying within a reasonable range for you.  Let's close this deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm framing this offer as a ""final concession"" to show Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  $10,500 is closer to Bob's offer while still being significantly higher than his last proposal. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to remind Bob of the benefits he'll receive.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using phrases like ""close this deal"" and ""make this happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm still aware of John's offer and ready to walk away if Bob doesn't accept this final counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm afraid $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000, which is the price I'm willing to pay. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's Offer is More Attractive:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, making it more profitable to sell to him than to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **No Further Room for Compromise:** Bob has stated he won't go any higher, and further negotiations are unlikely to result in a price I find acceptable.

**It's time to move on and secure the better deal with John.**"
