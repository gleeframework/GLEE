Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I think you'll find valuable. Given its unique features, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than Bob's estimation without explicitly stating it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more in control of the process. You can then potentially meet somewhere between his perceived value and your desired price. 

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your bottom line is $15,000."
