{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum value of $100, but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value of $150, while still leaving some profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While I could sell to John for $100, I'd prefer to keep negotiating with Bob. I believe there's a higher price point we can agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $115 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $107 is reasonable. It's closer to my minimum value of $100 and we've already had several rounds of negotiation. It's time to close the deal and secure the sale."
