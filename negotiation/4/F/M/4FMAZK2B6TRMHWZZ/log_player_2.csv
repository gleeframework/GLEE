Alice's offer is far above your budget. It makes sense to reject and start negotiating."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However,  $2,200,000 represents a significant discount from its true value. To move this forward, I could consider $1,850,000.  This allows us both to benefit.

You have three options:

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to my budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your seriousness about this purchase. While $950,000 is significantly below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept $1,500,000.  This is a non-negotiable final offer, as I already have another buyer at this price.

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and she's indicating it's her final offer.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  While I would have preferred to save more, getting the product for $800,000 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product altogether."
