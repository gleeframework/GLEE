"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential ROI for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800,000. This is my best and final offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However,  $2,200,000 represents a significant discount from its true value. To move this forward, I could consider $1,850,000.  This allows us both to benefit.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,850,000 is still above my price point.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your seriousness about this purchase. While $950,000 is significantly below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept $1,500,000.  This is a non-negotiable final offer, as I already have another buyer at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
