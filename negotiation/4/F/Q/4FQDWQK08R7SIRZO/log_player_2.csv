"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal.  While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, this product offers substantial value that I'm confident will make it a wise investment for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.
