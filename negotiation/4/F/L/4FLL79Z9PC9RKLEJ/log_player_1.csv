"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial offer:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a fair price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  I'm starting high to leave room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal his willingness to negotiate and his potential price range. 
* **Prepare for counteroffers:** If he rejects, I'll adjust my offers based on his responses.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am proposing to purchase the product for $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still room for a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I will adjust my strategy based on his previous response and the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,400,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm reducing my offer to $1,600,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and emphasizing the ""fairness"" of my new offer. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding middle ground:** I'm aiming for a price that's in the middle of our two initial offers.
* **Maintaining a strong stance:**  I'm still refusing to go below my minimum price, showing Bob that I'm serious.
* **Limited rounds:**  I'm mindful of the limited rounds and will adjust my strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects again, I will need to make a more significant concession or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position. I would like to propose purchasing the product for $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** $1,550,000 is just $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited rounds:** We are in Round 4, leaving only 6 rounds remaining.  It's getting risky to continue negotiating. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even if I accept this offer, there's still a chance for future deals with Bob. 
* **Selling to John:**  While John's offer is higher, I don't want to risk losing a potential customer (Bob) and the potential for future business.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time and the closeness of Bob's offer to my minimum price, it's strategically advantageous to accept his offer and secure the sale."
