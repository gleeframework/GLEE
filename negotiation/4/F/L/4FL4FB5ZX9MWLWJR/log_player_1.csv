Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's less than his perceived value) while still maximizing your profit. 

Here's the offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and confidence. It avoids being overly aggressive.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. Here's why:
    * **Profitable for you:** It's $150,000 more than your guaranteed offer from John.
    * **Attractive to Bob:** It's $150,000 less than his maximum value, giving him a potential ""deal.""

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Response:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if you'd rather walk away and sell to John.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important (for potential future deals), you might consider a slightly lower starting price to show goodwill."
