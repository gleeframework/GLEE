"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its value."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" and ""incredible potential"" to justify the high asking price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This initial offer sets a strong anchor point. Even if Bob rejects it, his counteroffer is likely to be closer to my desired range than if I started lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I understand its value, but I am currently only able to offer $1,400,000 for it. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price.  I'll counter in the next round to steer the negotiation closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls short of what I can accept. This product has garnered significant interest, and I believe a price of $2,000,000 is more reflective of its true worth. This is a significant price reduction, showing my willingness to find a compromise."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price significantly from $2,300,000 to $2,000,000. This signals flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Anchoring:** By making a large concession initially, I'm hoping to anchor Bob's expectations for future offers closer to my desired range.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes continued high demand for the product, justifying the price point despite the reduction. 
* **Pressure:** Mentioning other interested parties subtly introduces a sense of competition and urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must respectfully decline. I would like to continue our discussion and propose a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Walk away:** He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, but there's no guarantee he'll go much higher. 
* **Stall:** Prolonging negotiations gives me less time to potentially find another buyer if needed.

Taking the $1,600,000 offer now secures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
