"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $15000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 might be a bit out of your budget. However, I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $16500?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $17000. It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",17000.0,Alice,5,
