You're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can still get the product for less than $100, so it's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to do $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $87? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87

Alice has come down to $87, which is within your budget and a good deal compared to John's $100 price.  Accepting this offer is the best option."
