"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a discounted price of $100. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a reduced price, and I get to sell it to someone who appreciates it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
