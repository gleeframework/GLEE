"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still a good price point for you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000. It's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still gives you a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it's a much fairer starting point for negotiation. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $725,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. Would you consider $775,000? This would be a fair compromise, giving you a significant discount while ensuring I receive a reasonable price. What do you say?",775000.0,Alice,5,
