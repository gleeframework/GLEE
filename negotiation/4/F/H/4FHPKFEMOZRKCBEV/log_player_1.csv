Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still a good price point for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better starting point.
* **Emphasizing value:** My message highlights the potential savings for Bob and implies that the product is worth more to me. 
* **Open to negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I indicate I'm open to negotiation and willing to work with Bob to reach an agreement. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a significantly lower offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000. It's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** My next counteroffer will aim for a price closer to my desired amount, while still acknowledging Bob's lower limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still gives you a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it's a much fairer starting point for negotiation. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate that the offer is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing his potential savings.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let's see if we can bridge the gap"" indicates that I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:** While John's offer is tempting,  I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired outcome. I want to see if I can get closer to $800,000 or even higher before settling.
* **Counter-offer potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target and explore further concessions from Bob. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000,  I'm not yet ready to walk away.  I want to see if a better price with Bob is possible. 

**Next steps:** I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price but still shows flexibility and willingness to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $725,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. Would you consider $775,000? This would be a fair compromise, giving you a significant discount while ensuring I receive a reasonable price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  My counteroffer of $775,000 is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize that this price is a ""fair compromise"" and provides a ""significant discount"" for Bob.
* **Encouraging agreement:**  Asking ""What do you say?"" invites Bob to accept the offer and conclude the negotiation.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** While John's offer is still tempting, I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob before resorting to selling to him."
