Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer but $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair value given my needs and the market.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm  willing to go up to $14,000, which is a substantial compromise on my end. This represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
