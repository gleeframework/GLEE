Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer but $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair value given my needs and the market.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $22,000 represents the high-end value this product brings, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway at $17,000? This reflects my effort in developing and bringing this unique product to market, while still offering you significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. $17,000 is close to my limit, but I can still try to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm  willing to go up to $14,000, which is a substantial compromise on my end. This represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
