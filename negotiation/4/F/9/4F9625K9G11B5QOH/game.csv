,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still think the product is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $14,500. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a little. $14,500 is still a bit steep for my budget though.  Would you be willing to do $13,000? I think that's a fair price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $14,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your patience. I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about $13,250?  That's the best I can do.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can do $13,750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon.",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're close!  I can tell you're motivated to get this done. How about we split the difference and do $13,500? That's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. I can do $13,750, but I'm not going to go any higher than that. This is my final offer.",13750.0,Alice,9,
