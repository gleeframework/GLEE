"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. Given its significance, I believe it's only fair to discuss the potential transaction at a price that reflects its true worth and benefits both parties involved. Considering its intrinsic value and the benefits it offers to someone like yourself, I am extending an offer to purchase this product for $1,200,000. This price not only ensures a fair exchange but also leaves room for negotiation if necessary. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of working together on this exciting endeavor. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you can leverage John's offer and likely negotiate a better price from Alice or proceed with purchasing from John at your desired price point."
