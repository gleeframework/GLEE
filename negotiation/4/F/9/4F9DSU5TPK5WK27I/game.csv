"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $7,000? That's a reasonable price that's closer to my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,000, which would be $8,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find is a great value for the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
