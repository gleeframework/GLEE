"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I'm eager to make this purchase and believe this offer represents a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $13,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,5,
