"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation and gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Honesty about Value:** I'm being transparent with Alice about the product's value to me. This might encourage her to be more reasonable in her counteroffer.
* **Backup Plan:** I have John's offer of $12,000 in my back pocket if negotiations with Alice fall through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, she's still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I know I can get the product for $12,000 from John, so I'll continue negotiating to see if Alice will move closer to my price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I'm eager to make this purchase and believe this offer represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I've increased my offer to $11,000, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate and meet her closer to the middle ground.
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  My offer remains below my fallback option of buying from John at $12,000.
* **Expressing Interest:**  I'm reiterating my interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $13,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and it's still above John's price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge, and I risk losing out on the $12,000 deal with John. At this point, it's more strategic to secure the product from John at the lower price."
