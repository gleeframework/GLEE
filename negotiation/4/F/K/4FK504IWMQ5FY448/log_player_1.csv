Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While your valuation is understandable,  the price you're proposing doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential this product holds. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still confident that this product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the price is right. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $1,700,000. Accepting this offer ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely. It's a good compromise."
