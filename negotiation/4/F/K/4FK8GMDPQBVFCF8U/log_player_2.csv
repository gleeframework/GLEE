Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000, and it's better to secure the product from John at the desired price of $800,000 than risk further negotiation."
