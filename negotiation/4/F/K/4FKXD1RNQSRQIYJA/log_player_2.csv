# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm aware it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that reflects its significant value.  Please consider my offer of $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
