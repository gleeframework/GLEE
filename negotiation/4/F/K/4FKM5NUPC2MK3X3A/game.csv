"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than that.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your position.  However,  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I could be willing to meet you halfway. Would you be interested in $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
