"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I know you've been looking for something like this and I truly believe it will exceed your expectations. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than that.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer starts $150,000 below Alice's offer, which is a significant drop, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is friendly and explains your rationale for the counteroffer, showing that you're taking her offer seriously.
* **Within Budget:**  The offer is within your target budget, but still potentially profitable for Alice given her floor price of $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your position.  However,  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I could be willing to meet you halfway. Would you be interested in $1,375,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my target price of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as I still have time and Alice seems willing to compromise.  There's a good chance I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** The counteroffer is only $25,000 higher than the previous one, showing a willingness to meet halfway but not drastically changing the negotiation.
* **Staying within Budget:** The offer is still within Bob's target price range, keeping him in a strong position.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message reinforces the value of the product to justify the price, making the offer seem more reasonable to Alice."
