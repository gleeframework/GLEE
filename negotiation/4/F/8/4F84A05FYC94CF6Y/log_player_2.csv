{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to tell if $500,000 is a good price.  Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  If she's serious about selling, she should at least come closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still not sure if $400,000 is the best I can get. I'll counter again and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

I'm gradually increasing my offer, but still trying to stay below what I'd pay John.  Hopefully, Alice will be willing to meet me halfway at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could keep negotiating, I'm getting a good deal at $350,000.  It's better than paying John $1,500,000 and saves me a significant amount of money."
