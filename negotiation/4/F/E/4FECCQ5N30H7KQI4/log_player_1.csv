""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your decision as soon as possible."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000 (because you can sell it to John for that price).
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a potential win-win scenario:
    *  It's significantly more than Bob's valuation, so he's unlikely to accept immediately.
    * It gives you room to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum. 
    * It allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially close a deal quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Budget:**  It's unclear what Bob's budget is. If $1,300,000 is far beyond his reach, the negotiation might stall. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John. If negotiations with Bob drag on, it might be more profitable to move on quickly to John."
