"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is out of my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will provide a good return on your investment.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I've done extensive research and analysis, and its true market value is much higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This price reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a great deal.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,600,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't accept it at this time. I'm willing to consider $1,750,000 as my final offer. This represents a substantial compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's value.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling very confident about $1,650,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe this price reflects the value we've both discussed. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
