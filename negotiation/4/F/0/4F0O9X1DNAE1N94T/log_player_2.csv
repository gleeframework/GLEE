"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's within my budget, I can likely get a better deal by negotiating. I'll reject the offer and try to counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering your own value for it and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high. I can likely negotiate a lower price. While I'm running out of rounds, it's still better to keep negotiating than to buy from John at a much higher price. I'll reject Alice's offer and try to counter with a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still beyond my ideal price point. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000, which is $1,150,000. I'm confident that this price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the sale. Let's make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has repeated her previous offer, so there's no progress. While I'm running out of rounds, I can't afford to settle at $1,150,000. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further. If she won't budge, I'll likely have to accept her offer or buy from John in the next round, as it's too late to try to negotiate with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and it represents a significant commitment on my part. I'm hoping you'll see the value in closing this deal and accept my offer."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to budge on her price. We're down to our last few rounds, and while I can continue negotiating, it's unlikely that we'll reach an agreement at a price that's significantly lower than $1,150,000. 

Since I'm running out of time, it's more beneficial to accept the offer from John, even though it's higher. I've already established a price floor with Alice, and it's unlikely she'll lower her offer to my ideal price point. It's more prudent to secure the product at a higher price than risk losing the deal altogether."
