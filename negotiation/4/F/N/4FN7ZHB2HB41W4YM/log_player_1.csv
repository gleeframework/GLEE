Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to get as much money as possible, knowing she has a guaranteed $800,000 backup offer.

**The Risk:** If Alice's price is too high, Bob will reject it, and she'll only get the $800,000 from John.

**The Sweet Spot:** Alice needs to propose a price that's significantly attractive to her while also being tempting enough for Bob to choose it over walking away.

**Here's a possible offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal considering its potential return on investment."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward, highlighting the product's value.
* **Premium Pricing:** The $75,000 markup aims to secure a significant profit for Alice.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""return on investment,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth more than even her asking price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Knowledge:**  If Alice knows that similar products sometimes sell for even higher prices, she could adjust her offer upwards.
* **Bob's Urgency:** If Alice senses Bob is eager to acquire the product, she might push for a higher price.

**Remember, this is just one possible offer. The optimal price depends on how much risk Alice is willing to take and her assessment of Bob's willingness to pay.**"
