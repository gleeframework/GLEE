"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think it's a fair price considering its value.

The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $145. It's worth $150 to you, but you want to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your perspective, I can't go as low as $135.  Would you consider $140? It's a compromise I'm willing to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

Alice has come down to $140, which is still a good deal for me. It's lower than what John is offering, and closer to my desired price point. Accepting this offer saves me $10 compared to buying from John."
