Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while ensuring we stay above our minimum price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value creates a sense of a good deal while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting other interested buyers encourages Bob to act quickly and perceive the offer as more valuable.
 
This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while acknowledging the fallback option of selling to John."
