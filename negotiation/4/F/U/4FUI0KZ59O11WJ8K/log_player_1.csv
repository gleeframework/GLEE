Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $14,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
