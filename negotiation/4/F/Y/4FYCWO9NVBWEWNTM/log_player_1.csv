Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. It's still a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a bit higher. Would you consider $9,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 9500}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
