"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still constrained by my budget. Could we possibly meet at $960,000? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still making a reasonable offer.",960000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $965,000, which is closer to your offer and still a fair price considering the value it brings. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",965000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget again, and I believe we could reach an agreement at $960,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,6,
