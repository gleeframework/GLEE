,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I think it's a bit above my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you do $11,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",10200.0,Bob,4,
