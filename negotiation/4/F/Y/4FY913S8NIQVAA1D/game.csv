"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm proposing $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this compromise?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $975,000 is closer, it's still below my target.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,025,000. This is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit.  Let's finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $990,000 is still quite a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $1,005,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're still not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
