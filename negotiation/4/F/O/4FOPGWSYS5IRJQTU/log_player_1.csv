Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $115 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer, while still securing a profit above my minimum ($100).
* **John as Backup:** I keep in mind that I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is still a profit above my minimum acceptable price ($100). While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that:

* **Bob might walk away:** Prolonged negotiations could lead Bob to lose interest or find an alternative.
* **Time is valuable:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting now secures a good profit immediately. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale or spending more time on negotiations for a potentially marginal gain."
