"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a fair price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I'd be willing to pay $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I can do $1,025,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $975,000.  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a premium for this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000, which is a great price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal!",985000.0,Alice,7,
