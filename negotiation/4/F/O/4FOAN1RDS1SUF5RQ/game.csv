"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $7,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to lower the price below $7,500. However, I am willing to include a special warranty package valued at $500, making the effective cost for you $7,000. This includes a year of free maintenance and upgrades.",7500.0,Alice,3,
