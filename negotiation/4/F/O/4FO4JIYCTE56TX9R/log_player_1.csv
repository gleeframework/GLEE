"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is below my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation. This hopefully encourages Bob to accept, but also allows for future counteroffers if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses low. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a good price for you and gets me closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some thought and I'm willing to go up to $105. This is the most I can afford right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, Bob will be willing to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I value our negotiation, $105 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience, Alice. I'm willing to pay $107 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still stubbornly low, and with only 4 rounds remaining, I'm running out of time. I'd rather not risk losing even more money by continuing to negotiate. John's offer guarantees me my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him."
