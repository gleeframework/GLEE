"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price is fair considering my maximum budget, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. I'm confident this is a deal we can both agree on.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $950,000 is still not enough to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to reach your target price, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering we've both made concessions.  If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to explore other options.

"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I need to be honest with you - I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,300,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If we can agree on this, I'm confident we can close the deal.
