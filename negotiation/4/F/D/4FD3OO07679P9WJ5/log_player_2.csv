"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $20,000 is already a competitive price for this product and its value.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000.  It's a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, $17,000 is still significantly higher than his budget of $8,000. He should keep negotiating to try and get a price closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,500? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,500 is a lower price than before, it's still outside of Bob's budget.  He should continue negotiating to get a better deal. It's getting closer to his target price, so he should keep trying to reach an agreement that works for both sides."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $14,500 is still too high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go above $13,000.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 13000}
