Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $14,500 is still too high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go above $13,000.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to your $15,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would be a significant loss compared to selling to John."
