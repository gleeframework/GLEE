Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation if needed.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:** This starts the negotiation strongly in your favor. 
* **Justification:**  While vague, mentioning ""value and potential"" subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob might think. 
* **Politeness:**  Maintaining a professional and courteous tone can lead to a more agreeable negotiation.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, you might consider a lower offer to ensure a deal. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
