"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know if you're interested! If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you can save more money by rejecting it. You know John is willing to sell the product for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed to buy from John."
