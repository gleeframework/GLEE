"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but I believe the value of this product goes beyond $1,200,000.  How about we find a middle ground at $1,275,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but I'm afraid I've already stretched my budget as far as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
