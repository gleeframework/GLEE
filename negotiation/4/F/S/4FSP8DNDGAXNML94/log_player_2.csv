Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
