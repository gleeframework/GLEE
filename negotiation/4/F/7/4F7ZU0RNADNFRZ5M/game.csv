"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500?  This is a significant value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value I'll get from the product.",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway *again* - let's make it $12,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can make a profit.  Let's close this deal now.",12000.0,Alice,5,
