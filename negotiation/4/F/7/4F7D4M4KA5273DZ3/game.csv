"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm looking to sell the product to you for $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $750000. Considering your interest, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is a compromise that I believe is still reasonable, given the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
