"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm looking to sell the product to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $750000. Considering your interest, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is a compromise that I believe is still reasonable, given the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and still leaves a profit margin for Alice. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving a substantial amount of money.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob getting a worse deal from John outweighs the potential benefit of saving a bit more."
