{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $115 is more than Bob's maximum price of $120. 
* **Better options:**  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. 

**Next steps:** Bob should counter with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to start the negotiation by getting a lower price than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Balance:** $105 is a significant reduction from Alice's $115, but it's still within Bob's budget and potentially attractive to Alice.
* **Flexibility:** This initial counteroffer leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds, as Bob can adjust his offer depending on Alice's responses."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110 is still more than Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **Better options:** There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.  Since Bob has 10 rounds, he has time to try to get a better price.

**Next steps:** Bob should counter with a lower offer again, but he might need to increase his counteroffer slightly if he wants to be successful."
