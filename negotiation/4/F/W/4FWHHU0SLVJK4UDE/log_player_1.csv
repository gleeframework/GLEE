{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to be friendly and positive to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and go with $145? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, his final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
