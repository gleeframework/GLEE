Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I want to try to get closer to my goal of $100.  I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a bit higher in the next round."
