"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I know it will be a game-changer for you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor you to the $1,000,000 price, emphasizing its ""true value"" and mentioning another buyer to create urgency. Since you have John as a backup who will sell it to you at the same price, there's no harm in rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down."
