Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $1500000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details!,2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll counteroffer at $1800000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to me is at least $1500000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1800000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer at $1700000. This is already a great deal for you, considering the product's value to me is at least $1500000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm not willing to go much lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1700000, so I'll offer $1650000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1650000. I'll counteroffer at $1670000. This is a very fair price, considering the product's value to me is at least $1500000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1670000.0,Alice,7,
