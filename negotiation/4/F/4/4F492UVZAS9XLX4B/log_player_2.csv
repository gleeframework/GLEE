# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer matches John's price, there's no harm in seeing if she'll come down a bit. You have nothing to lose by rejecting and seeing if she'll offer a better deal."
