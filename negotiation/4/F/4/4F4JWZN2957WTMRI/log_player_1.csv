Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers, Alice creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification for Price:** While not explicitly stating its worth to her, the message hints at the product's value (""significant value"").

This strategy aims to maximize profit. If Bob accepts, Alice gets $2,000 more than her minimum. If he rejects it, she can still sell it to John for her minimum acceptable price."
