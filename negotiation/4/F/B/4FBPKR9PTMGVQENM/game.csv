"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has tremendous value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $775,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
