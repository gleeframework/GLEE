I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  We're getting the product for $825,000, a saving of $175,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller concessions from Alice. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal.
* **Risk of Losing Out:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer. If we push further, we risk her walking away, forcing us to buy from John at the higher price."
