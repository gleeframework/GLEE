"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. He knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice and he has a backup option with John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is already a competitive price considering the value this product offers. To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but Bob is still determined to get the best deal possible. He can potentially secure the product for less than $1,125,000, given his knowledge of the product's value to Alice and his backup option with John. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my ability to purchase from John. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,075,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my desire to close this deal.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000.  While this is higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still a good deal for him. It's only $100,000 more than what he could get from John.  Given that Alice has stated this is her final offer, it's likely that further negotiation will be fruitless.  

Bob should accept the offer and secure the product for a price that is still significantly lower than the product's worth to Alice."
