"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe there might be room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 just doesn't cover the value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",10000.0,Alice,5,
