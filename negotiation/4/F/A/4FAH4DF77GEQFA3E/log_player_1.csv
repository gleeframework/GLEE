I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While Bob is getting closer, his offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not comfortable risking further negotiation, and John is offering a guaranteed deal that meets my needs."
