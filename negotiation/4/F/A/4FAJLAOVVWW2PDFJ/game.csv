"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the price further. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my value for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000, which reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a feasible price point. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let me know if this price point works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I see you're committed to finding a solution. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this demonstrates my sincerity in wanting to make this deal happen. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
