"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You'd save $1,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **The product is still worth more to you than Alice.** Even at $14,000, you're getting a product you value at $15,000."
