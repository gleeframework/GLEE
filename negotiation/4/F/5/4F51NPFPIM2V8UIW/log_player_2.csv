"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,100,000. He has a maximum budget of $1,200,000 and knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but I'm not sure I can go that high.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,075,000. This is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000 and is a good price considering he initially offered $1,050,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob money compared to buying from John."
