"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $90, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can do $95, and I think it's a good middle ground. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",95.0,Alice,5,
