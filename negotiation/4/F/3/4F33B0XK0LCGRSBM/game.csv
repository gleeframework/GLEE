"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $10,800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
