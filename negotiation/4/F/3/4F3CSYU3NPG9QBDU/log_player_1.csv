Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to work with me.  Let's see if we can finalize this. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I believe this is a win-win scenario, and it keeps us both within our desired price ranges. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,600,000 is a significant profit over my alternative offer from John."
