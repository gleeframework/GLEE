"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. A counteroffer of $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000). 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer signals Bob's serious intent to buy but also shows he's willing to negotiate. It leaves room for further compromise. 
* **Time:** With 10 rounds, there's time for back and forth. A more aggressive counteroffer could risk alienating Alice early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has come down from her initial $11,500, but $11,000 is still too high for Bob.  
* **Potential for More Savings:**  There's still room to negotiate further, especially since Alice rejected Bob's previous counteroffer. Bob can likely get a better price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's $12,000 is higher, Bob has time and should aim to beat that price.  

By rejecting, Bob can counteroffer again and try to close the gap towards his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really aiming for $10,750.  This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Bob is increasing his offer by a smaller amount ($250) compared to his previous offer. This shows he's serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.
* **Middle Ground:**  $10,750 is close to Alice's last offer of $11,000, making it a more appealing compromise.
* **Time Management:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, with 10 rounds, he has time to be more strategic. A smaller increase in the counteroffer might encourage Alice to accept.
* **Staying Competitive:** Bob is still keeping John's price of $12,000 in mind."
