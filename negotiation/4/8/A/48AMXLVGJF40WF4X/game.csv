"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $999000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $850000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go to $780000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it's a price I can manage.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $780000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $820000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
