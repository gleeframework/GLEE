{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $999,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit of $800,000. You should reject and try to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further, or you can always opt for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $850,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go to $780,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it's a price I can manage."", ""product_price"": 780000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $780000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $820000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, her final offer of $820,000 is still over your budget.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $800,000, it makes sense to go with John's offer. You'll save $20,000 and avoid any further negotiation."
