"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
