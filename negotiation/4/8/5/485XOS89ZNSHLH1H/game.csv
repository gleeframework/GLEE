"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This still gives you a great price, considering your valuation of the product, and it's fair for me as well. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This would be a fantastic deal for both of us - it gives you a great price for the product, and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
