"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it will be even more valuable for you.  Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can find a better price. How about $1,250,000? This is a bit more in the middle, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I think we can find a better price. How about $1,225,000? This is a bit lower than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,225,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference again.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and would allow us to finally reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
