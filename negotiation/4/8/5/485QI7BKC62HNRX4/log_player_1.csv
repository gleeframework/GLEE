Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a good deal for you and gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'll try to get a bit more from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $135.  This is a fair compromise, and it still gets you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $132 is getting close to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob and haven't gotten him to budge much, so I'm going to sell to John for $150.  It's a better deal for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
