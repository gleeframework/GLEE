"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a good deal for you and gets me closer to what I need.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $135.  This is a fair compromise, and it still gets you a great deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",132.0,Bob,6,
