"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  It also establishes a strong starting point. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still holding out for a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I still want to see if I can get more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm countering with $1,550,000. This is another compromise, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to agree."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Although I could continue negotiating with Bob, I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that John will buy at $1,500,000,  which is a better deal for me than Bob's offer."
