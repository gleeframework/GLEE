"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start with a low counteroffer to test the waters. $100 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and still within Bob's budget, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his preferred price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should stick to his maximum budget and make a final counteroffer of $120.  This is the price he's willing to pay and is also the price he can get from John. If Alice doesn't accept, Bob can walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  There is no indication that Alice is willing to budge further, and continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a lower price.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John for his target price of $120."
