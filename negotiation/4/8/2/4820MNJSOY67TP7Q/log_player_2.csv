Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While this is very close to Bob's maximum price, he can still try to get a better deal. He's only used 7 out of 10 rounds, and with only a small difference from his maximum price, it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12700}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is pushing for a final compromise, offering a price just below Alice's last offer.  This shows a commitment to buying while still trying to get a better price. With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to be aggressive to close the deal at a favorable price."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is just $800 over Bob's maximum price. With only two rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  It's unlikely Bob will be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds, and buying from John for $12,000 would be a better option. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price very close to his maximum, minimizing his potential loss."
