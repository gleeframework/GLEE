I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while we're getting closer, it's not clear we'll reach a deal that is satisfactory to me. Since John is willing to pay my full asking price, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further haggling."
