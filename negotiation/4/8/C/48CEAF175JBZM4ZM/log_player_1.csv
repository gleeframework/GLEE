Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000, Alice should aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Reasonable Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value"" to entice Bob while justifying the high price."
