"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth more to her than to me, so she's likely to be making a profit. I can get it from John for cheaper.
