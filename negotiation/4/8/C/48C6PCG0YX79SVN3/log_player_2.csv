"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Even though it's below your max, you can likely get a better price.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and negotiate a lower price.
* **John's price is your fallback:** If the negotiation fails, you still have a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a strong counteroffer:**  A significant drop from $9,000 shows you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Focus on your value:**  You're offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum, but closer to what you're willing to pay.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  There's still space for Alice to come down a bit without losing too much profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,750. It's a great compromise, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $8,750 is a reasonable price for both of us. 
* **Limited time:**  We're already in Round 3, so it's getting closer to needing to use John as a backup option. 
* **Value for both:** While you save $250 from Alice's initial offer, Alice still makes a profit. This ensures a win-win scenario."
