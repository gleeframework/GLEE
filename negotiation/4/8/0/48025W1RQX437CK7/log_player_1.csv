Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding both their valuations. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message implies Alice is open to discussion (""Let me know your thoughts""). This gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer, and Alice can then strategically move towards a more agreeable price.
* **Confidence:** The tone is positive and emphasizes the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market research:**  While this response provides a starting point,  knowing the typical market value for similar products would allow for a more informed offer.
* **Bob's personality:**  If Alice has any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive), she can adjust her approach accordingly.
* **Risk tolerance:** A higher initial offer carries the risk of Bob immediately rejecting it. Alice needs to weigh this risk against the potential reward."
