{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might counteroffer, but you can still make a profit.
* **It's within Bob's range:** $115 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $100, giving him incentive to negotiate.

By starting with a higher price, you can see if Bob is willing to pay closer to your valuation. If he's not, you have the option to counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think I can agree on $105 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $110 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out something closer to $100. Can we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to go above $105, and that is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's better to sell to John for $120 and guarantee a profit."
