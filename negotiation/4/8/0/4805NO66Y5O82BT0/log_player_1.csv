Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" aiming to justify the high price in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for negotiation if Bob counters. It's unlikely he'll accept $2,000,000 outright, but it opens the door for a discussion that could still land above $1,500,000.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, more back-and-forth would likely occur, allowing me to adjust my offer based on Bob's responses and gauge his willingness to pay."
