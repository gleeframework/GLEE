"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  He has no information on Alice's minimum price, so there's potential to get a better deal.  Going to John right now would be a sure way to spend the maximum amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a substantial discount.  He's offering 800,000 which is 100,000 less than Alice's offer, showing he's serious about negotiating.  This gives Alice a chance to either accept a lower price or come back with a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a significant discount from her initial offer and only $50,000 more than Bob's counteroffer. Accepting at this point is a good deal for Bob.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the opportunity altogether or ending up paying more to John."
