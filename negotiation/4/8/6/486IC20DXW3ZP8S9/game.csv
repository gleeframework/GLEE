"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it, but considering my budget and the current market situation, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a price closer to $900000? This would allow me to make the purchase while staying within my financial limits.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we aim for a price of $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, based on my budget considerations and the current market conditions, I am not able to meet the proposed price of $1050000. I would like to continue our negotiations by suggesting a price closer to $950000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we aim for a price of $1075000?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline the latest offer of $1075000. My budget constraints remain unchanged, and I am unable to meet this price. I am proposing a final offer of $975000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the current market conditions and my financial limitations. I hope this proposal will be considered seriously.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $975000.
