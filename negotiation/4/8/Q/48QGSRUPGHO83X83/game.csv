"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further if you're open to it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that I'm not willing to go down to $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's unique value. Let me know if you're interested.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
