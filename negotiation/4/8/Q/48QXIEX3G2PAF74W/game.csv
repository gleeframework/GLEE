"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $1000000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraint.  While $1000000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This reflects the unique value of the product while acknowledging your financial limitations. Let me know if this works for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for being flexible.  $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
