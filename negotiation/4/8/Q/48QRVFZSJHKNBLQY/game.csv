"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's priced fairly considering its value. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product,  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",13000.0,Bob,4,
