Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for you and still fits within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,175,000 is still too high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.
