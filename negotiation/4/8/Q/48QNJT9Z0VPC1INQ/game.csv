"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we meet at $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
