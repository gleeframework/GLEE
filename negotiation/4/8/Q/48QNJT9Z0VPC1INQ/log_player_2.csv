"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. While the product is worth more than $800,000 to you, there's room for negotiation to get a better price. You're willing to walk away and buy from John if needed, so you have leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($600,000) gives you room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below your $800,000 limit.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on her price. If she accepts immediately, you know you could have gone even lower. If she counters, you can gauge her willingness to move towards your range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, $850,000 is still above your maximum budget and your fallback option (John at $800,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's message suggests she's willing to negotiate further (""meet in the middle"").  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows you to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Alice's last offer ($850,000) and your previous offer ($600,000). 
* **Staying Below Budget:**  Crucially, it keeps you well below your $800,000 maximum and provides a buffer for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Projecting Fairness:** The language (""fair compromise"") emphasizes that you're willing to move towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we meet at $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Your Limit:** Alice's offer of $800,000 matches your absolute maximum budget and your alternative option (buying from John). 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and you risk losing the deal altogether. It's unlikely you'll get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now saves you time and the potential stress of further negotiation."
