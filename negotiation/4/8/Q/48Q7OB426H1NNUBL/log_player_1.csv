Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so she starts with a strong offer of $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation but aims to secure a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Alice doesn't start at the absolute highest ($1,500,000) because it might make Bob hesitant or feel like there's no room to negotiate.  
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has a backup plan with John ($1,200,000), giving her leverage. She won't accept offers below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is Alice's absolute minimum acceptable price. She knows there's a gap between what Bob is willing to pay and her target. By rejecting this offer, Alice signals she's not desperate and is willing to negotiate further to close that gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice acknowledges Bob's offer but stands firm on the product's value. By suggesting a price of $1,300,000, she's demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  The ""meeting halfway"" framing makes the offer seem more appealing and reasonable to Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept or counter with a price closer to Alice's target. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Alice remains above her fallback price ($1,200,000 from John), retaining her negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. How about $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is anchored at $1,200,000. He has now repeated this price twice, signaling he's unlikely to budge significantly.  While Alice *might* be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price from Bob with further negotiation, it's risky.  

* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation takes time and effort. Alice has a guaranteed offer in hand from John, making further haggling with Bob potentially not worth the effort for a small potential gain.
* **Certainty:** Selling to John provides immediate and guaranteed profit. There's no guarantee Bob will ever agree to a significantly higher price."
