Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than $80, but may not be ready to pay my full asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price of $120. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $105 is significantly less than my initial goal, it's still better than selling to John for $80. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal with Bob."
