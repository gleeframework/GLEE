Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($1,150,000) creates a strong incentive for him to accept. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob immediately might be preferable even if it means a slightly lower profit than waiting for John.

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a quick sale at a good price and leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
