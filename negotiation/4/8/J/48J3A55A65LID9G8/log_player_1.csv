Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers to create a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The price leaves some room for negotiation if Bob attempts to haggle.  However, it ensures you are still making a substantial profit above Bob's $1,000,000 valuation and closer to your guaranteed $1,500,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product."
