"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest. I understand your perspective on the price, however, I know the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is too low. Would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $1,275,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,187,500?",1187500.0,Bob,4,
