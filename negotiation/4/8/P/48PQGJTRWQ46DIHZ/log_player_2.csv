"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is too high.  You want to save as much money as possible, and you know you can get the product for less than that (your maximum is $1,500,000, and you know Alice values it at $800,000).  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to find a middle ground. Considering the unique value this product offers, I'm proposing $1,200,000.  I believe this price point reflects a fairer balance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your desired range.  You want to get the price as close to your $1,000,000 counteroffer as possible.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my initial counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to see some movement from your side as well. I'm proposing $1,175,000. Let's find a way to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still a little high, but we're getting closer.  It's worth seeing if we can push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer and countering again could potentially lead to a price closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
