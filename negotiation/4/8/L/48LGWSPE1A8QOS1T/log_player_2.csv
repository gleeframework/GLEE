Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $11,250. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but it seems like she's not willing to go lower than $11,750.  At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and save yourself $750."
