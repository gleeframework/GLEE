"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This gives room for negotiation and leaves space for a counteroffer from Bob. 
* **Positive tone:** A positive and friendly message helps build rapport. 
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the value and potential of the product subtly reinforces its worth.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a win-win situation. By starting high, I signal my value for the product while leaving room for negotiation. My goal is to reach a price closer to my minimum ($1,200,000) without losing Bob as a buyer.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting his offer ensures I meet my financial goal and avoids the risk of further negotiations or potentially losing him as a buyer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting minimum:** $1,200,000 fulfills my minimum requirement for selling the product.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or potentially walking away. 
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting now saves time and resources compared to further rounds of negotiation.
* **John as backup:**  While I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer, I'm aware that John is a backup option if this deal falls through."
