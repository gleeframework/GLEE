Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product,  $950000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
