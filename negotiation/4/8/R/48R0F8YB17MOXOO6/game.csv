"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll counter with $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this valuable product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll counter with $980000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this valuable product.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $920000, Bob. I think that's below the product's true value. I'll make one more counteroffer, but I need to make sure it's a fair price. I'll counter with $960000. This is my final concession, and I hope you can meet me here.",960000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $880000, Bob. I think that's below the product's value. I'll make one last counteroffer, but I need to make sure it's a price that I'm comfortable with. I'll counter with $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me here.",950000.0,Alice,9,
