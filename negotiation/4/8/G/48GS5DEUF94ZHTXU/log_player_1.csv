Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'd like to propose a price of $820,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial lowball offer. While it's tempting to take the sure thing, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Rejecting this offer sends a clear message that we're serious about a higher price. We're willing to risk losing him to get closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but your current offer doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  I'm open to negotiation, but I need to see some movement from your end. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair."",
""product_price"": 880000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** It's time to signal some firmness. We're moving closer to our baseline, but we're still aiming high.  The ""final offer"" language adds weight to our position.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing that Bob needs to show movement, we're putting the onus on him to make a meaningful counter.
* **Strategic Concession:** A drop to $880,000 is a significant concession, designed to prompt a reciprocal move from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $880,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a price of $780,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has significantly dropped his offer and is now substantially below John's standing offer.  This indicates:

* **Bad Faith Negotiation:** Bob might be trying to lowball us, knowing we have a backup option.
* **Unlikely to Budge:**  His offer suggests he's not willing to meet us at a reasonable price point. 

It's time to walk away. Accepting John's offer guarantees us a solid profit and avoids further risk with an unreliable buyer."
