# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me and the value it will bring to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or by going with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay under $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to me.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is close to my budget, but I'm still hesitant to accept.  I know John will sell me the product for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for me. There's no guarantee Alice will accept my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from John."
