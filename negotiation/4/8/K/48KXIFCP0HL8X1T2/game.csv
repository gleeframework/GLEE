"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. How about we meet at $11,500? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
