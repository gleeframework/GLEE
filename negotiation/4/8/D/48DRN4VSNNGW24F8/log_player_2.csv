"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $110. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $110. 
* You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. 
* There's no immediate urgency to buy from John, as his price is your maximum limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $95? I'm really interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $100, which is within your budget.
* You've already made a counteroffer and been rejected.  Further negotiation might not lead to a lower price.
* Buying from John at $120 is more expensive, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal if you reject Alice's offer again."
