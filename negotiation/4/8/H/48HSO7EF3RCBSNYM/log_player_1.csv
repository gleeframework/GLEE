Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  The offer needs to be significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer to ensure Alice doesn't settle for less if Bob initially rejects the offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's exact willingness to pay.  In real-world scenarios, more information about the buyer's budget, needs, and negotiation style could lead to a different offer."
