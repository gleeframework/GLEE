Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in our product, Bob. In light of our discussions, I am willing to consider a price of $1085000 for the product. This proposal aims to provide a fair compromise, reflecting the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate. I hope this aligns with your expectations and we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,085,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation progress:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price.

While Bob could potentially try to get a lower price, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids a more expensive alternative."
