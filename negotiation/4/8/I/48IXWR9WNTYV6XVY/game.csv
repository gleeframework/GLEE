"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it can significantly benefit your business. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects the true value of this product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I can see you're serious about this purchase. I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
