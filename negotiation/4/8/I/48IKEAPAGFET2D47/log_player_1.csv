Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This price is:

* **Higher than my minimum acceptable price:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000, so this offer is within my acceptable range.
* **Lower than the product's value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he has potential to make a profit by accepting my offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
