Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it at $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can always lower the price or counter his offer. And if the negotiation stalls, you can always walk away and sell to John for $80."
