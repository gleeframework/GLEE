"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm extending this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $120. This is a special offer tailored to appreciate your interest and ensure you receive the best deal possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is $120, which is still outside your limit. Therefore, you'll reject the offer."
