Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1050000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a significant amount, it's still less than my ideal price. I want to explore if I can secure a higher price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to bridge the gap."
