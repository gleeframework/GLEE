Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Aiming for Above Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000. By offering it at $19,000, you're aiming to capture a significant portion of the potential profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  He might counter-offer, and you can then decide if you want to meet him somewhere in the middle or stick closer to your minimum price.

**Important:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know about your guaranteed offer from John. If Bob knows your bottom line, this strategy is less effective."
