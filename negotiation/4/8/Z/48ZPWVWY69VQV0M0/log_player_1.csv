"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob without revealing my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by starting with a price that's not completely unreasonable. 

**Next Steps:** I'll monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially lower my price, but I'll always aim to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product. I can use this opportunity to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a compromise closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation process and propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  In the next round, I will propose a counteroffer that is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price, aiming for a middle ground.
* **Potential Compromise:**  I'll continue to analyze Bob's responses and adjust my offers accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the need to close a deal within the 10 rounds.
* **Option to Sell to John:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $15,000 open. If negotiations with Bob become too time-consuming or unproductive, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This still allows me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a good value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing both my need to make a profit and Bob's potential value from the product.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $13,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me some negotiating room and ensures I don't lose out on value.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Response:** I will carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* **Adjust Strategy:**  If Bob rejects, I'll need to determine if I should make another counteroffer or explore the option of selling to John. 
* **Time Management:**  I'm aware of the 10-round limit and will prioritize closing a deal that meets my minimum price requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit high.  Would you consider $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to lose that much money on the sale. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's coming closer to my price point. This indicates potential for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue leading the negotiation and potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counter with a price closer to $13,000, aiming to meet halfway.
* **Timing:**  I'll consider the remaining rounds and the risk of not closing a deal within the time limit. 
* **Selling to John:**  The option to sell to John for $15,000 is always available, but I'll keep negotiating with Bob for now, as a successful deal with him would be more profitable."

```

**Explanation:**
