Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. To make this work for both of us, how about $10,875?  That's a fair compromise, and it ensures a smooth transaction for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly coming down in price, and it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly lower than her current offer of $10,875. Since you can get the product from John for $10,000, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice.  You're better off securing the product from John at your target price."
