"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 to make this work.  Let's try to find a compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000?  This gives us both some room to be happy with the deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
