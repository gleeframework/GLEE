"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Could you consider reducing the price to $1,300,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,350,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it's a bit high. Could you consider lowering the price to $1,300,000? This would allow us to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
