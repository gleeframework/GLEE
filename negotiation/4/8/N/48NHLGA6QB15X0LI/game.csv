"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial ask. Let's meet closer in the middle; I'm proposing $1,350,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your revised offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, so I'm proposing $1,275,000. This is the maximum I can go, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront â€“ $1,275,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,310,000.  This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and ensures you're still getting a great deal. Let me know if you're willing to move forward.",1310000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,280,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1280000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're very close, but I need you to meet me halfway for this deal to work.  My final offer is $1,295,000.  This is a non-negotiable offer, and I believe it's more than fair given the value you're receiving.  Let me know your decision.",1295000.0,Alice,7,
