"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm also hoping he'll see the value and accept the offer right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still trying to get closer to my desired price. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $14,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and is closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  It's important to remember that each round brings the risk of losing the deal altogether, and with only 6 rounds left, I believe it's in my best interest to secure a sale."
