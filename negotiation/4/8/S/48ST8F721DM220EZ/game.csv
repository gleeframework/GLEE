"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $105. That would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $105 is closer, but I'm still looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be happy to pay $100, which would be fair for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",100.0,Bob,4,
