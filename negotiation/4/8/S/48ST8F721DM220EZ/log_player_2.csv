"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $120 is within your budget, it's significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Counter-offering is the best strategy:**  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to control the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mid-point offer:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's offer ($120) and your initial target price ($80).  This makes it a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  The message is polite and expresses interest, while clearly stating your position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $105. That would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While $105 is a significant improvement, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). This means there's more room to negotiate.
* **Continue negotiating:** Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going, potentially allowing you to get a price closer to your target.
* **Avoid buying from John:** Buying from John at $150 would be a much worse deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $105 is closer, but I'm still looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be happy to pay $100, which would be fair for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  This counteroffer is only $5 less than Alice's offer, showing that you're serious about making a deal but are still trying to get a slightly better price.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains polite and expresses a desire to close the deal.
* **Fair compromise:** Offering $100 is a potential compromise that could be acceptable to both parties."
