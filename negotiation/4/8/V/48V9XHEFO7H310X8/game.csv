"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed on.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
