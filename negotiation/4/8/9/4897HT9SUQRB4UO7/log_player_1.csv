"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but not so high as to be immediately rejected. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Highlight value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its worth. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I leave the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which is likely.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to $9,000 as possible without losing the deal. I'm willing to accept John's offer of $8,000 as a safety net, but I'll try to squeeze out a bit more profit if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is my minimum:** Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, it's not worth risking the deal in the early stages. 
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm open to further discussion. This could potentially lead to a higher price in future rounds.
* **Testing the waters:** Rejecting his offer allows me to see if he's willing to go higher than $8,000.

**Strategy:**

I'll use the next round to counteroffer and try to push the price closer to my desired $9,000. I'll keep John's offer as a backup in case negotiations fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $8,000 just yet. How about we split the difference at $8,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Reiterating value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize the ""good deal"" for both parties to make the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing Bob's flexibility:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is willing to budge from his $8,000 price. 
* **Building towards my goal:** If Bob accepts, I'll secure a good profit. If he rejects, I'll use the next round to either make a further compromise or stick to my desired price.
* **Maintaining John as a backup:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $8,250 as a compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my desired price of $9,000.
* **Minimizing risk:**  It's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I've already rejected two of his offers. Accepting now avoids the risk of him walking away completely.
* **Profitable outcome:** While it's not my ideal price, it still represents a significant profit for me.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing profit and risk:**  I'm choosing to secure a solid profit rather than risking the negotiation by continuing to hold out for a higher price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I still have John's offer as a backup in case anything goes wrong."
