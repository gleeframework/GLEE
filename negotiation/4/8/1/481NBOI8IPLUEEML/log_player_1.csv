Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This gives me a good starting point while still leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and the risk of losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $18,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $17,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get closer to $18,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to his last offer, hoping we can come to an agreement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17800}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,800. This is just a slight increase from Bob's last offer, hoping to close the deal without going too low.  I'm feeling confident that Bob will accept this offer and we can finally finalize the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's getting close to my minimum value and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  The risk of another rejected counteroffer is too high, especially considering I can always sell to John for $15,000."
