"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but allows for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I'm hoping to get closer to $100.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $95, $92 is a good compromise and getting closer to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and getting only $80 from John."
