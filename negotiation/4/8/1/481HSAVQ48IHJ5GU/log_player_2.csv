"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice is asking for $11,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by counteroffering.
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  But it's best to exhaust all negotiation options with Alice first, as you might get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Value for you:** $9,500 is still within your budget and allows you to potentially save a decent amount compared to Alice's initial offer.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will give you a good idea of how flexible Alice is and how willing she is to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she has come down from her initial offer, $10,250 is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **You have room for more negotiation.** You can still potentially get a better price by counteroffering.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** However, you're making progress with Alice and might be able to reach an agreement within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,250 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,800?  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This counteroffer is a small step up from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying within your budget:** $9,800 is still within your price range, and potentially leaves some room for further negotiation.
* **Building momentum:** This offer shows Alice you are serious about buying the product and encourages her to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,000, but that's my absolute best price.  This is a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your desired price.**  While she has come down further, $10,000 is still outside your ideal range.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You've shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice has done the same.  You can likely find a middle ground.
* **John's offer is a fallback.** While it's always an option, it's better to continue negotiating with Alice if possible, as you might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $10,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can land on a final price that works for both of us.  How about $9,900?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant move:** This counteroffer shows a genuine effort to meet Alice halfway, bridging the gap between your last offer and hers.
* **Close to your target:**  $9,900 is very close to your desired price range and would allow you to save a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer.
* **Highlighting the deal:** Emphasizing a ""fair compromise"" and the potential for a ""final deal"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to accept."
