"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $1,100,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's value to you and the market. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to go up to $1,075,000.  Let's try to close the deal at a mutually beneficial price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than your latest offer. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'll counteroffer $1,090,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value and the market. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,090,000 is still a bit more than I can justify. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,080,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer $1,095,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value and the market. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll need to consider other options.",1095000.0,Alice,7,
