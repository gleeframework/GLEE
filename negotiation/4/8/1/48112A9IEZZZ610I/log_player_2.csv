"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great price, as it's worth at least that much to me, and I know it's worth that much to you as well. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $15,000. You can get the same product from John for $15,000.  Therefore, you should reject Alice's offer and buy from John. You won't save any money, but you'll avoid the risk of Alice raising her price if you were to accept."
