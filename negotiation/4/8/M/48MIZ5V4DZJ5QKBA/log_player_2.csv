"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $100.**  This is lower than your maximum willingness to pay ($120).
* **Buying from John costs $120.**  This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
