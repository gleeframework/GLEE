"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if she's willing to negotiate further and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is a substantial reduction from her initial offer, and it's likely she won't accept it immediately. However, it sets a clear expectation that I'm aiming for a price closer to my limit of $15,000.  This strategy allows me to see how flexible Alice is and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $12,000 to $11,000.  This is a good deal for me, considering my maximum budget is $15,000.  Accepting the offer saves me $4,000 compared to buying from John. It's important to remember that there are limited rounds and I want to secure the product within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my offer and ending up paying John's higher price isn't worth the potential small savings."
