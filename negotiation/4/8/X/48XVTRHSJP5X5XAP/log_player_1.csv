Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000** because I can sell it to John for that amount.
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $1,200,000**.
* **Therefore, I'm offering a price of $1,150,000**. This gives me a significant profit over my minimum while still leaving Bob with a good deal. 

This approach aims to maximize my earnings while still ensuring a high chance of Bob accepting the offer."
