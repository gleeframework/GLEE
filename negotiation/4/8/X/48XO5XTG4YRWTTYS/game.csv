"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a strict budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to negotiation, but $13,000 is still a bit low. How about we settle for $14,000? This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows me to reach a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $13,250, but that's really pushing my limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're pushing your budget, but $13,250 isn't quite there yet.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal.",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I can offer $13,500. It's a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal now.",13500.0,Bob,8,
