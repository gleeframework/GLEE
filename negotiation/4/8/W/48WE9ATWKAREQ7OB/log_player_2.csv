It seems like Alice is not budging much on the price. She's gone up to $11,400, and it's unlikely she'll come down significantly in the remaining rounds. At this point, it's more strategic to cut your losses and buy from John for $12,000. You'll save yourself potential frustration and time by securing the product now."
