"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would give you a great product at a competitive price, and it allows me to stay within my acceptable range.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000. This price reflects a significant value for you and is closer to my minimum acceptable range. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm confident that the value of this product justifies a slightly higher price. Let's compromise at $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get this exceptional product while still staying within your budget.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm afraid that's the lowest I can go.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is the absolute highest I can go. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
