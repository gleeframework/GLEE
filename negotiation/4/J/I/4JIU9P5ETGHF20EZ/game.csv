"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Could you consider meeting me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $130. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $135, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think $135 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $132.50?",132.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135, but I'm willing to sweeten the deal a bit. I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth $10, so the total value you'll get is $145. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",135.0,Alice,7,
