"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While the product is good, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
