Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  This is my final offer,  let me know if you're willing to negotiate.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look at other options.

You have three options:

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $800,000 offer. It makes no sense to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000 from John."
