"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000.  I'm confident it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiations and hopefully get a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  This is my final offer,  let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's a reduction from her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
