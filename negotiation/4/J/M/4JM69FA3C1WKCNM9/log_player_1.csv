``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Bob's offer leaves room for further negotiation. I can still try to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John now would guarantee my minimum, but I might be able to get a higher price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll likely counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer.  I'll aim for a price around $1,350,000, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a win-win agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by reducing my price from the previous round, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, showing that I'm still taking Bob's offer seriously but not giving away too much.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're still working within your budget, but $1,312,500 is still a little lower than where I need to be.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are in round 8, leaving only two rounds left. 
* **Small Incremental Gains:** Bob's offers are increasing, but the increments are becoming very small. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** There's a high risk that we won't be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Minimum:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

**It's better to secure the guaranteed minimum now than risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price than John's offer.**"
