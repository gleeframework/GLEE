Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product for $1,150,000. This is a significant amount, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for Bob:**  I'm aware that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so this price is within his range of acceptable values.
* **Minimizing risk:**  I'm not starting at a price close to my minimum, as this could lead to a lengthy negotiation. 

I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product at this price, but if he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further.  If he does not come close to my desired value, I can always go with John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I believe I can get a better price.
* **I'm willing to negotiate further:**  I'm not giving up on this deal yet.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement. 
* **Keeping John in the picture:** I'm aware that John is a backup option, but I'm not ready to sell to him just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $1,125,000 is a compromise.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer but still trying to secure a good price. 
* **Staying firm:**  I'm confident that Bob values the product highly and will be motivated to make a deal at this price, which is still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Strategic negotiation:** By showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, I hope to encourage Bob to accept my offer without resorting to a lengthy back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob has lowered his price, it's now below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of continued negotiation:** I'm concerned that further negotiation with Bob might result in a prolonged process without a guarantee of a better price. 
* **Securing a guaranteed sale:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed sale for $1,000,000, which is my minimum.  It's better to secure this guaranteed sale than to risk losing more time and potentially a lower price with Bob."
