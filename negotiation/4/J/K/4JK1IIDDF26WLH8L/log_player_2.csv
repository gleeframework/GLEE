"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a price lower than John's, and it's a fair compromise with Alice. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and leaving Bob to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
