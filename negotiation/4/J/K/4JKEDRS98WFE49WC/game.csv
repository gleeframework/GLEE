"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product. This price is still profitable for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1250000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1350000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
