"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1400000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum asking price and still leaves you a comfortable profit margin. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for you. You have 9 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This price is still profitable for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1250000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1350000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice you're willing to meet her halfway.
