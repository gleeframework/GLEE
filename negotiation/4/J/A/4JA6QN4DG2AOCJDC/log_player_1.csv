Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible, but needs to offer Bob an incentive to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob only values the product at $100, so Alice needs to go significantly lower than her $150 minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so she can be a bit bolder with Bob.

By offering the product at $140, Alice creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:

* **Alice:**  Earns $40 more than Bob values the product.
* **Bob:** Gets a $40 discount and a product he wants.

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can sell to John at her desired price."
