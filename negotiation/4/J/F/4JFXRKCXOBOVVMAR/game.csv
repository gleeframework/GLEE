"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
