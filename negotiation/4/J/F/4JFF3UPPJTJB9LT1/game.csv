"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise. This product is worth a lot to you, so I hope you'll consider this offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price given your value and my budget. Let's try to find a compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and represents a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
