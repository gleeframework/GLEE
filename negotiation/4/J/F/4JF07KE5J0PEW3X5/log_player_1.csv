Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000?

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000, I'm still willing to negotiate.  I believe there's room for Bob to come up a bit more. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $925,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I can only consider a price of $900,000 for the product. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  We've been negotiating for several rounds, and it seems like we are at an impasse.  With only a few rounds left, I'm not confident that I can reach a price that meets my needs.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I get the price I'm looking for."
