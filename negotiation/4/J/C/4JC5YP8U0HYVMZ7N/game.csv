"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000 for this product.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's keep talking.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  It's a fair price considering the value this product offers you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both some room to work with. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a sweet spot here.  How about we compromise once more and settle on $1,075,000?  This price allows me to move forward and keeps things fair for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's make this deal happen.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
