"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice is offering the product at exactly that price, you won't be able to save any money by accepting her offer. You can buy the product from John for the same price, so there's no advantage to buying from Alice."
