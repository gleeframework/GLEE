"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.
