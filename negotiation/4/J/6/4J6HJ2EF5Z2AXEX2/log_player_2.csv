# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Explanation:**

You can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's value to you.  Your goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John achieves that."
