"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $16000 is a bit out of my budget. Could we possibly discuss a price closer to $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
