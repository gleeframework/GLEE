{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's potential to get more. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you can try to bridge the gap and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This is a great deal for a product that's worth significantly more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $125 is a good deal. It's above your minimum of $120 and a reasonable compromise.  Since you're unsure about Bob's maximum, accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a decent price."
