"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $14,000. This represents a significant saving for you, as it's worth at least $15,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your absolute maximum of $15,000, you know you have an alternative seller (John) willing to sell for $15,000.  This means you have a fallback option and some room to negotiate with Alice.  By rejecting her initial offer, you might incentivize her to lower the price further to avoid losing the sale."
