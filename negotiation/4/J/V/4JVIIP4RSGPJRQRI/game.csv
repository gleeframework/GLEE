"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $2,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000 again, as I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this product in the hands of someone who recognizes its value.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ if this offer isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000 again. I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
