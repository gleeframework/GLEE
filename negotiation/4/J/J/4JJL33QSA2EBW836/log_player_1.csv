Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is just too low for me right now. How about we split the difference and go with $175?  I'm still willing to negotiate further."", ""product_price"": 175}

While I'd love to keep pushing for a higher price, Bob has come up to $160, which is closer to my minimum than John's offer of $150.  I'm going to accept his offer to secure the sale."
