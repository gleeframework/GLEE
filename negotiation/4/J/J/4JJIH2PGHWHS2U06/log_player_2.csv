"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $12,000. It's best to try and negotiate with Alice first, as he might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will signal that he's serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if necessary. $10,000 is a substantial discount from $18,000, and it's a starting point that Bob can adjust based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is a significant decrease from the initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He can still get the product from John for $12,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

Bob should increase his offer to $11,500. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product. It's also closer to his budget, and still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $14,500 is getting closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $12,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get an even better price, especially since he's already made significant progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer, but this time only by a small amount. $13,000 is a compromise, showing Alice that he's willing to meet her halfway. It's also still within his budget and allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. Even though Alice has lowered the price, it's still above his budget.  He can still get the product from John for $12,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice for a better price. There are only a few rounds left, so Bob needs to be persistent."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob should make a final push with his counteroffer.  He's been slowly increasing his offer, showing Alice his commitment.  $13,500 is a compromise, close to his budget and hopefully enticing enough for Alice to accept. It's the last chance to make a deal before he has to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $13,750 is still above his ideal price, it's a significant improvement from her previous offers. He's nearly out of rounds and has only one more chance to counteroffer. There's a good chance Alice won't budge further, and he would end up paying $12,000 to John.  This is a good compromise, saving him $1,250 compared to buying from John."
