{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price above Bob's perceived value of the product. This allows for room for negotiation and potential profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering. I'm not willing to sell for $9,000, but I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable selling for $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's fair considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, I'm trying to get as close to the price I found from another seller as possible 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired price.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiations and potentially end up with a price lower than John's offer. Selling to John guarantees me a $10,000 profit, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept."
