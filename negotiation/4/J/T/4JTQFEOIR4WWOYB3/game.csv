"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's a bit too high for my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $8,000, which is my absolute minimum. Let's make this deal happen!",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $7,800. I think that's the best I can do, and I'm hoping you can make it work.",7800.0,Bob,6,
