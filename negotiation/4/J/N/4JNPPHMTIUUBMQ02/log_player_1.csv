"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit. I'm also using a friendly message to build rapport and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I need to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for some negotiation.  I'm emphasizing the good deal it is for Bob, hoping to persuade him to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $80 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely Bob will come up to my price.  Therefore, it's best to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
