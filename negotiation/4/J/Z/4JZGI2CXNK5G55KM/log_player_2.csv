Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still above your budget. You're still early in the negotiation, and there's a good chance you can get the price down further.  You're also getting closer to the halfway point, which is a strategic time to push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. To seal the deal, I'm willing to go up to $862,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is still above your target price of $800,000.  You have only three rounds left and the negotiation isn't moving as quickly as you'd like.  There's a risk that you'll run out of time and end up paying more than you want. 

It's more prudent to take the guaranteed deal with John at $800,000. You'll save $85,000 compared to Alice's offer, and you'll be able to close the deal quickly."
