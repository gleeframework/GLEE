"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $800,000. To make things move forward, I'd like to offer $850,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $850,000. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the product's potential, $900,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm ready to make a final offer of $875,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer of $887,500. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. To seal the deal, I'm willing to go up to $862,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and allows us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",862500.0,Bob,6,
