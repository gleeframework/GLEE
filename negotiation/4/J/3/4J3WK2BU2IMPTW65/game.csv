"That's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking $10,500 is a fair price for both of us. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a good compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,
