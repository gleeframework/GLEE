"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for negotiation and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000.  This is still above my minimum value but shows I'm willing to compromise.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I still have time to negotiate and John is a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although I'm running out of time, I'm still determined to get as close to my minimum value as possible. I'm going to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is the same as Bob's last offer, which means I'm willing to meet him halfway to get this deal done. We're in the late stages of negotiation, and I'm hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. I'm running out of time and Bob is not budging much. Although it's not my ideal price, selling to John guarantees me my minimum value. It's better than risking further negotiation and ending up with an even lower price."
