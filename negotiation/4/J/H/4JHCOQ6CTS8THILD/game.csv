"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $1000000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $950000 is tempting, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $900000. Would you be open to considering that price?  I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $925000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
