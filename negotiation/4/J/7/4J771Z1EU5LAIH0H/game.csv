"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $130 at this time. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $130. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $155. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's meet in the middle.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $145. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $142? It's a small difference, but it's the most I can offer.",142.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $145 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $142. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $143. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",143.0,Alice,7,
