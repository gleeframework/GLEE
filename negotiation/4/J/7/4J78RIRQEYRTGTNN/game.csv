"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is simply too low for me at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. ",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still unable to go below $105.  I believe this is a fair compromise, as it's only $5 more than your offer and allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this deal happen.",105.0,Alice,5,
