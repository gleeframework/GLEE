"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
It's better to try and squeeze out some more profit. Even though Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is simply too low for me at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still unable to go above $100 for the product. Could you consider lowering your price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to go that low. While selling to John is tempting, I still have several rounds left to try and get a better deal with Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still unable to go below $105.  I believe this is a fair compromise, as it's only $5 more than your offer and allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am still not able to go above $100 for the product. Could you consider meeting me halfway between $105 and $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's getting late in the game, and while I'd prefer $105, Bob's offer of $102.5 is still a good profit.  It's a win-win situation, and I'd rather close the deal than risk losing out to John or continuing to haggle with Bob."
