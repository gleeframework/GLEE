Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a good price, but I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd prefer to get the most I can, I won't settle for a price that is significantly below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,300,000, which is still a significant amount above Bob's initial offer, but closer to the middle ground. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's an improvement. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering the price again to $1,200,000.  This is a significant concession, but it's still a price that allows me to make a profit. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, even though it's getting closer. I've already made significant concessions, and I don't want to risk going lower and losing a good deal with John. I'm confident that I can secure a better price with John, so I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
