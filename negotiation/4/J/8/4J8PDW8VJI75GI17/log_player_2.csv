"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a price significantly lower than its true value to me. I understand its worth to you is $800,000.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, a price that offers you substantial savings and still allows me a fair return.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $1,500,000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
