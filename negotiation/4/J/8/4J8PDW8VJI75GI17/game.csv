"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a price significantly lower than its true value to me. I understand its worth to you is $800,000.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, a price that offers you substantial savings and still allows me a fair return.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $1,500,000.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
