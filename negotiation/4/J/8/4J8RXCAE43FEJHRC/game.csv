"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $700,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,
