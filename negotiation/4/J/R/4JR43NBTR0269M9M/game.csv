"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further,  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a substantial discount.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there with your offer.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
