"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than the product's worth to her, it's still more than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer closer to your ideal price or allows you to buy from John for $1,000,000."
