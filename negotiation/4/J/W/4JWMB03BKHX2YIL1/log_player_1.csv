Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer represents a significant profit for you, as you are selling the product for $100,000 more than what it's worth to Bob. However, it's still lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on John who is willing to pay your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what the product is worth to him, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a higher price.  You can always fall back on selling to John for your minimum price if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer.  It still leaves room for further negotiation, but it also shows that you're serious about selling the product and are willing to meet Bob halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is too low.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of further lowering the price isn't worth it. John is a guaranteed sale for your minimum acceptable price, making him the best option at this point."
