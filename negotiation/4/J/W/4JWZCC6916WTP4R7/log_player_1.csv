Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will more than pay for itself. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I can only go up to $11,500. Can you consider this revised offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price that reflects the product's value to me. It's unlikely he will suddenly jump to a much higher offer. Accepting his current offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's standing offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
