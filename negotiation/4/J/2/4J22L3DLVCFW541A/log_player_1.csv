I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it's clear he's very unlikely to go above his $1,000,000 limit.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation when I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John."
