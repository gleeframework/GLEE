Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers will far exceed the price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to maximize potential profit.  I don't know Bob's perceived value, so I'm aiming for a strong starting point.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm framing the offer around the value the product provides, not just the price. This might encourage Bob to see it as a worthwhile investment.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While $1,000,000 is a high price, it leaves room for negotiation. I'm prepared to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'm ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the flow of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value I'm willing to accept for the product.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I would prefer to make more, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he might walk away entirely. 
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale and avoid further negotiation rounds, which can be time-consuming and uncertain.

This decision is based on the information provided and the need to maximize profit while considering the potential for further negotiation."
