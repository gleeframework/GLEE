"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I have to consider my own value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a decision today. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
