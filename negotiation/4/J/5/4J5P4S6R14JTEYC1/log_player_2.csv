"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $820,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $820,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $800,000.  While it's closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $820,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price, as it's your stated value for the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $800,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to add a small premium for the hassle of negotiating with you. I can offer the product to you for $810,000. This is a one-time concession, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now trying to extract a premium for the negotiation, which is not desirable for Bob.  Given that John is offering the product at Bob's target price of $800,000, it makes more sense for Bob to buy the product from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
