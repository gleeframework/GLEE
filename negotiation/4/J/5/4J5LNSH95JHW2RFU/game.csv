"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,100,000 is below my initial asking price, I understand you see the value in this product.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Could we settle at $1,175,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000. How about $1,225,000? This is my final offer.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
