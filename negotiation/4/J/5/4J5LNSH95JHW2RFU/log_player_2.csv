Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000. How about $1,225,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:

This is a good deal for you, Bob. Here's why:

* **Price:** $1,225,000 is significantly less than your $1,500,000 maximum and a good saving compared to John's offer.
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Negotiation Progress:** You've successfully negotiated Alice down from $1,400,000. 

While you might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice walking away and forcing you to buy from John at $1,500,000 is too high."
