"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting, $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to let it go for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is my final offer. If you're serious about buying, let's close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a big jump, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
