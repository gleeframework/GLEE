"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is far too high.  It's important to remember that your goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counter-offer process and hopefully reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $22,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price reflects a significant compromise and remains fair given the product's benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal. It also leaves open the option of buying from John if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. While $18,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a meeting point."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer.  How about $15,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above your budget of $8,000.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is increasing.  At this point, it's safer to go with the guaranteed price from John, even though it's not the absolute best deal."
