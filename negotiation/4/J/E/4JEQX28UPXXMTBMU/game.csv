"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price.  To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this point. This product offers a unique solution that I'm confident will bring you significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? ",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can find a better middle ground. My revised counteroffer is $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I value meeting in the middle, the value this product brings warrants a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $887,500? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while recognizing the true worth of what's on the table.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $887,500 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. My revised counteroffer is $862,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",862500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",875000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. My revised counteroffer is $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've considered your offer carefully.  However, I believe my previous offer of $875,000 is more than fair given the value this product brings. I'm willing to let this offer stand for one more round, as I believe it represents a mutually beneficial agreement. If we can't find common ground at that price, I'll need to explore other options.",875000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to make one final offer of $850,000. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing from John for $1,000,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,10,
