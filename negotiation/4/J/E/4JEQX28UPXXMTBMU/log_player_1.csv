Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I value meeting in the middle, the value this product brings warrants a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $887,500? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while recognizing the true worth of what's on the table."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $887,500 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. My revised counteroffer is $862,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is consistently coming up in his offers. We haven't reached a point where his offer is so close to our minimum that it makes sense to accept yet. We'll continue the back-and-forth to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding firm at a price point closer to our initial offer but showing flexibility by coming down slightly.
* **Finality:** Stating this is our final offer adds weight and encourages Bob to seriously consider it. This can prompt him to either accept or make a significant counter-offer.
* **Time Consideration:** We're halfway through the rounds, and introducing a sense of urgency can push the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. My revised counteroffer is $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has returned to his original counter-offer after we presented our ""final offer."" This suggests he may be less willing to move significantly from this point. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $850,000, we have a limited number of rounds left to see if we can push him a bit higher.  We'll use the next round to send a strong signal that we're not budging much further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your offer carefully.  However, I believe my previous offer of $875,000 is more than fair given the value this product brings. I'm willing to let this offer stand for one more round, as I believe it represents a mutually beneficial agreement. If we can't find common ground at that price, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  We're reiterating our ""final offer"" price, making it clear we're not willing to go lower.
* **Time Pressure:** By stating we'll explore other options, we create a sense of urgency and put the ball firmly in Bob's court.
* **Alternative Implied:** This subtly reminds Bob we have John as a backup, even without mentioning him directly.  

This strategy aims to either secure the $875,000 or prompt Bob to reveal his final offer in the last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to make one final offer of $850,000. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing from John for $1,000,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bluff Called:** Bob has called our bluff, implying he knows about John and is willing to buy from him at a higher price. This is likely a tactic, but it changes the dynamics.
* **Last Round Risk:** It's the final round.  If we reject Bob's offer, we risk him walking away and getting nothing, as we don't know if his statement about John is true.
* **Solid Profit:** Accepting $850,000 is still a significant profit above our minimum of $800,000. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale altogether."
