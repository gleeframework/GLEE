Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her product's worth to her ($1,200,000) and Bob's potential valuation ($800,000). Starting with a high but not outrageous price leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value, aiming to anchor Bob's perception of its worth closer to Alice's asking price.
* **Alternative:** Alice always has John as a backup buyer, giving her a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still above his perceived value of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:**  Alice knows she can sell to John for her minimum acceptable price. This allows her to be firm in the negotiation with Bob.
* **Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice signals that she's serious about getting a higher price and forces Bob to potentially increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can exceed your expectations. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,025,000."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice comes down from her initial offer, but not drastically. This signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Justification:** The message reinforces the product's value, attempting to shift Bob's focus away from the price and towards the potential benefits.
* **Midpoint Pressure:** The new price is slightly closer to Bob's offer, putting a bit of pressure on him to move closer to Alice's desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand the value you're placing on this product. However,  $1,025,000 is still above my limit. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $950,000. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:** While not ideal, $950,000 is a significant profit for Alice, especially considering Bob's initial offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Negotiations can stall or break down. Accepting a reasonable offer avoids potential losses from prolonged haggling or a failed deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away. Accepting now secures the profit and allows Alice to potentially pursue other opportunities."
