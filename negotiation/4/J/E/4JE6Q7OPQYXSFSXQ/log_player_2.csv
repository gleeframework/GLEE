"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000. This is a 20% markup, and Bob should try to get a better deal. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Bob can potentially get the product for closer to his target price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  This serves as a safety net, ensuring Bob doesn't overpay. However, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first to see if a better price can be achieved."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer begins with a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget but leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling pressured to accept immediately. 
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, justifying the offer and framing it as a win-win."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer, but still too high.**  While she's come down from $1,200,000, $1,150,000 is still $150,000 above Bob's maximum value. 
* **More room for negotiation.**  The fact that Alice is willing to negotiate indicates there's still room to find a price closer to Bob's target. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  While this remains an option, it's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a better price can be reached before resorting to John."
