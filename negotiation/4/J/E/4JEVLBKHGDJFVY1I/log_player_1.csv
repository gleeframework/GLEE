Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $10,000, so he may be willing to pay a little more to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want for the product. I believe I can push for a better price, as Bob clearly sees value in the product and has already made a counteroffer. I'm willing to risk a little to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $13,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still leaving some room for negotiation, but I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's interest in the product and my own minimum asking price."
