"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above your budget. It's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price with Alice before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $12,000, which is still a good deal for Alice since it's more than her minimum value of $15,000. This counteroffer is a significant step towards my budget, and it's likely that Alice will accept it or counter with a price closer to mine."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is within my budget and represents a good compromise. It's also closer to my initial counteroffer of $12,000, suggesting that further negotiation might be unproductive. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product while staying within my budget."
