Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't logically pay more than that.
* **Negotiation Zone:**  There's a potential negotiation zone between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price higher than your minimum while still making it attractive enough for Bob to accept. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting with a price significantly closer to your minimum but leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""potential"" subtly nudges Bob to focus on the product's worth to him, potentially exceeding his initial valuation. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation instead of just saying yes or no.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, with John as a backup, you're in a strong position to negotiate confidently."
