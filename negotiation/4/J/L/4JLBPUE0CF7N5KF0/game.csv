"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your business acumen.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,225,000? This reflects my willingness to strike a deal while still recognizing the product's worth.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I think $1,225,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that price point doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,190,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate that compromise. It seems we both agree this product is valuable and a deal should be struck. How about we split the difference on our last two offers and close at $1,170,000?",1170000.0,Bob,6,
