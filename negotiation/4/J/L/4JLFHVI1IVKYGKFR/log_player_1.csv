Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counter. This allows me to potentially earn more, but also ensures I don't immediately lose a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is more than my absolute minimum, it's significantly lower than my desired price and I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? That's still a great deal for a product you value at $100, and I think it's fair considering my asking price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $75. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob since I can guarantee myself $80 by selling to John."
