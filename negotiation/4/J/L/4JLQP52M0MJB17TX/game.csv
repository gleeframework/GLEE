"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for your product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1500000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that $1200000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can come to terms.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
