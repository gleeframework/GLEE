"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand it's a significant investment for you, but $10,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $11,500? This allows you to still get a good deal, and it gets me closer to my goal. Let's try to make this work!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500.  How about we meet in the middle again?  I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000. This is a fair compromise that lets us both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is my final offer. If you want to get this product, this is the best price you're going to get from me.",10750.0,Alice,7,
