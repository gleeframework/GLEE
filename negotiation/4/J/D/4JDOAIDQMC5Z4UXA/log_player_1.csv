Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a chance to own it at a great price. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,999 is just below my guaranteed price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates the perception of a deal for Bob while maximizing my potential profit.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
