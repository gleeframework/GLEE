"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I've already received another offer from another buyer who is willing to pay $15,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using a common negotiation tactic called ""anchoring"" by mentioning the $15,000 offer.  While she might have another offer, it's also possible she's bluffing. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not easily swayed and open the door for a lower counter-offer. You have a strong alternative with John offering the product at $10,000, so you're in a good position to negotiate."
