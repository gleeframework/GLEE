"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $180 is a bit out of my budget, however.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $120? It's a fair price for both of us and gets me closer to my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can sell it to you for $130. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still below my minimum price of $150. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
