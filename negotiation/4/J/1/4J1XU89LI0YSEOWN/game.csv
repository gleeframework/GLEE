"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm really only able to offer $9,000 for the product.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's above my budget and below what you're hoping to get.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can see the value in making a deal at this price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm really only able to offer $9,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, as it's still above my budget and closer to what you're hoping to get.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,500, which is $10,250. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. Let's make a deal!",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,250 is still too high for me.  I'm only able to offer $9,750. This is a fair compromise and gives us both a decent outcome.  Let's make this happen.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally make a deal.",10500.0,Alice,9,
