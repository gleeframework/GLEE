"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm valuing it at $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is less than her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and John's offer. By rejecting this offer, you can move to purchase from John and save $250,000."
