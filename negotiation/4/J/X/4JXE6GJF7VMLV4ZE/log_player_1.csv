Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
2. **Justification:**  Provide a reason for your high price (even if it's just the product's unique value).
3. **Gauge Bob's Reaction:**  Be prepared to negotiate down if he seems hesitant.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm valuing it at $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is a strong opening, leaving space for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential ROI, justifying the price.
* **Flexibility:** The tone is open for discussion, allowing you to adjust if Bob pushes back.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response. You can gradually lower your price, but always ensure you stay above your minimum of $1,500,000."
