"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $20,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This leaves room for negotiation if necessary. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiations or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm lowering my price to $17,000, which is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise and encourages further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial desired price. I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}

I'm now offering $15,500, only $500 above my minimum. This shows that I'm serious about closing the deal with Bob, but I still want to earn as much as possible."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a good deal. Bob's offer of $15,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or losing out to John."
