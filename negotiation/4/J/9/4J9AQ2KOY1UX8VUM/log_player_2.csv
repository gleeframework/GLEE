```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $11,250, he's still getting a good deal, saving $3,750 from Alice's initial asking price and $1,250 from John's price.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially ending the negotiation is high. It's better to secure a good deal now."
