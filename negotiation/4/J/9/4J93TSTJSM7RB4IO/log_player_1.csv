Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $175 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, but I have a cushion before hitting my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to get a premium from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
