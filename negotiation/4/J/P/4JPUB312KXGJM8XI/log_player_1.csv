Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My primary goal is to earn as much as possible.  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($14,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Leave Bob Room to Negotiate:** Even if Bob finds the initial price high, he may counter-offer. This opens up a dialog and allows me to gauge his interest level. 
* **Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000. If Bob declines, I'm not losing money. This knowledge empowers me to be firm in negotiations.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have some flexibility in negotiations and am willing to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob pushes back."
