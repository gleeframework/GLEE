"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's a good starting point, but he can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you consider $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point,  Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten a decent discount from the original price, and it's only $500 more than he'd pay John.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate would result in a lower price but might risk losing the deal altogether."
