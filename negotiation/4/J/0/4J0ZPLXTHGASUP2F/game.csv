"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? That would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $112.50.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $112.50 is not a good fit for my budget. How about we try $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. This is my last offer.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $110. I'm willing to pay $108, as I mentioned earlier. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's meet at $108.",108.0,Bob,8,
