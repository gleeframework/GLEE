"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's still a great price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, and I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which I believe is still a fair price for the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your persistence in negotiating.  While I understand your budget constraints, I'm unable to go lower than $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us. If you're not able to accept this final offer, I will be moving forward with another interested buyer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to walk away if I don't accept your offer, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,220,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000. I hope we can find a way to make this work.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
