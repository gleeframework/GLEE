"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a lower price point. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This strategy aims to push Alice closer to her minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for further negotiations. It's a bold move, but it sets the stage for a more advantageous position in the upcoming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $1,100,000? This still represents a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  He can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he has time on his side with 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, showing Alice he's willing to negotiate but still aiming for a lower price. This strategy is designed to create a sense of urgency for Alice, as she may be concerned about losing the deal if she keeps rejecting offers.  This also sets the stage for potential compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we may be too far apart on price. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,100,000.  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product to you. If you're not willing to meet me there, I might need to explore other options.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message indicates she's starting to get firm on her price. However, Bob still has time and rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows Bob to continue exploring if he can get a lower price. 

While buying from John is an option, it's better to try and get a better deal from Alice if possible, especially with 5 rounds still available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with a little more compromise."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, showing Alice he is still interested but trying to find a middle ground. This approach aims to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while keeping the price lower than Alice's preferred point. With 4 rounds left, Bob continues to pursue the best possible deal, avoiding the higher price from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling optimistic about finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,093,750. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still aiming for a lower price, but I'm willing to go up to $1,087,500.
