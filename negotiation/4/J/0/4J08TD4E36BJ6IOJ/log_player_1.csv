Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a lower price point. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $1,100,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,075,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not convinced it's a good deal for me. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with a little more compromise.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,087,500 is closer, but it's still not enough. We're getting closer to an agreement, so I'm going to make one last counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been going back and forth for several rounds now, and while we're getting closer, I'm starting to feel like Bob is not willing to meet my minimum value.  There are only three rounds left, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I at least get my minimum value."
