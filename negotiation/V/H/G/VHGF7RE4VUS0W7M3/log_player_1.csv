Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.
