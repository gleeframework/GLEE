"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I believe it's a great opportunity for us to find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.  This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $1,075,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the effort I've put into it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this point.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
