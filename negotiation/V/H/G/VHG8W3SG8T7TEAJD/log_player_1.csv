Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, and it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

This approach balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for maximizing my profit. I'm willing to walk away with John's offer, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
