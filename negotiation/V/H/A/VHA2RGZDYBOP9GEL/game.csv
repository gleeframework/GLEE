"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still leave a substantial profit for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you consider $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
