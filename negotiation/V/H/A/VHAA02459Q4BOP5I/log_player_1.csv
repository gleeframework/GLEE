{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! My price is $175.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This sets the stage for negotiation while leaving some room to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $175 is a bit too high for me though. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $95. That's a fair bit closer to your price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before selling to John."
