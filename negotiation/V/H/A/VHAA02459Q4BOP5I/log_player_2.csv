"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! My price is $175.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $175 is a bit too high for me though. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying well within your $100 budget.
* **Polite and Open:**  The message is polite and expresses interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, $130 is still significantly above your $100 limit. There's room to negotiate further and see if she'll come closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $95. That's a fair bit closer to your price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing the offer, but strategically staying below your $100 maximum. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and optimistic tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $95 is closer, I'm still hoping to get at least $120 for this product. It's truly a unique item. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much on her price, and it's unlikely she'll come down to a price you're comfortable with.  You have a guaranteed option with John for $100, which is a much better deal than the $120 Alice is offering."
