``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not going all-in on the first offer, leaving room for potential counteroffers and negotiation.

**Important Note:**  This is just my initial strategy. I'll be monitoring Bob's responses and adjusting my offers based on his reactions and the number of rounds remaining."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

* **Rounds remaining:** With 9 rounds left, I have time to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $10,750.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

* **Negotiation potential:** There is still room to negotiate. Bob is getting closer to my desired price and seems committed to buying the product.
* **Rounds remaining:** With 7 rounds left, I have time to try and secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price higher than $10,750 but lower than my previous offer. I'll try to find a middle ground that's more appealing to Bob while still protecting my minimum price. I'm also considering the possibility of offering Bob a small discount if he agrees to the deal in this round to incentivize him to close."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,750 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  How about we meet at $11,250?  That's only $500 more than your offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's wrap this up and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Next Steps:**

I'll continue to observe Bob's reactions and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm also prepared to walk away if the offer remains too low or if I feel that I'm not making progress."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $11,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal now.

* **Negotiation potential:** We are making progress, but there's still some room for negotiation. Bob seems committed to purchasing the product, and I believe I can secure a higher price.
* **Rounds remaining:** With 5 rounds left, I have time to continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price higher than $11,000, but lower than my previous offer. I'll aim to find a middle ground that is more appealing to Bob while still protecting my minimum price. I'll also consider incorporating a finality tactic, like mentioning that if we can't reach an agreement soon, I'll have to consider selling to John for $15,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

That's only $100 more than your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's reaction to this offer and adjust my strategy in the next round based on his response. If he rejects, I might need to be more aggressive with my next counteroffer or even consider selling to John if time runs out."
