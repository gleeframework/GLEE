"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $11,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value I place on this item.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you at $10,300, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10300.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,800 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,600. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10600.0,Alice,5,
