Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $135 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm setting the initial price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I get a decent profit. 
* **Open communication:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to discuss the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed, but this initial offer puts me in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I'm willing to accept.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me a chance to make a counteroffer closer to my target price and potentially close the gap. 
* **John's offer:**  While John is willing to pay $150, I still want to explore negotiating with Bob. If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a great deal for you, and it ensures I can make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial $135 but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining my profit margin.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value Bob is getting by highlighting the ""great deal"" at the offered price. 
* **Clear next step:** The message encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit shy of the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $127.50 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has come up a bit, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I know I can get $150 from John, which is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time and risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a lower price.  John's offer is a guaranteed deal that meets my financial goal.

It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John!"
