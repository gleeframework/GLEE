Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""value"" and a ""fair offer,"" Alice subtly anchors the price in Bob's mind.  
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** While Alice has a backup offer, it's important to remember that Bob doesn't know this.  Alice wants to appear confident in her pricing without scaring Bob away completely."
