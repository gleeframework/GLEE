{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give away the product for a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further. However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $120 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. Would you be willing to go down to $110? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still a loss for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not giving in yet.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $110 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  It's a fair compromise and gets us both closer to what we want."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $115 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more offer. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed that the negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a better price, it's clear we're at an impasse.  Since I'm only willing to sell for a minimum of $150, and Bob isn't willing to go above $105, there's no point in continuing this negotiation.  John has offered me a fair price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
