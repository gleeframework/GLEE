"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate further. However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. Would you be willing to go down to $110? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $110 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  It's a fair compromise and gets us both closer to what we want.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more offer. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,6,
