Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,300,000 is just a little too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I'm going to need a price closer to $1,400,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to compromise further to reach a deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000? This would give us both a fair outcome. What do you say?
