Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a good price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is fair considering the market value and my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to compromise further to reach a deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,275,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.
