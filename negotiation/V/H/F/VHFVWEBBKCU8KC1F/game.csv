"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a good price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,300,000 is just a little too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I'm going to need a price closer to $1,400,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is fair considering the market value and my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to compromise further to reach a deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000? This would give us both a fair outcome. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,275,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
