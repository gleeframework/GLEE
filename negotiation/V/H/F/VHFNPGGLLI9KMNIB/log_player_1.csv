Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're guaranteed $10,000 from John, so any offer above that is a win.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's a $500 margin for potential negotiation.  
* **It's a fair price:** It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a reasonable incentive to accept. 

By offering $11,500, you are aiming for a good deal while leaving space for a potential compromise."
