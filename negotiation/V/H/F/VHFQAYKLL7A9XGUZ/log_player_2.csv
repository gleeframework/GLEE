"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This price still provides a decent profit for you and is within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves a good profit margin for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for me. It's lower than what John is selling it for, and it leaves some profit margin for Alice. Accepting this offer is the best way to save money."
