"Hi Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good price for you.  Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we meet in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still too low for me. Let's try $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to sell the product without having to go to John.",14000.0,Alice,5,
