"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $1,200,000 and call it a deal?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. However, I was thinking that since we're so close to the original price I had in mind, I could actually meet you at $1,220,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you and the concessions I've made so far.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
