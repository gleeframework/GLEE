Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. However, I was thinking that since we're so close to the original price I had in mind, I could actually meet you at $1,220,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you and the concessions I've made so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $1,220,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
