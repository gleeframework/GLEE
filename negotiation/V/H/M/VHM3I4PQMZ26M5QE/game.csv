,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum, but still a good deal for you. I'll offer the product to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
