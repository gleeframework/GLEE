{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build a friendly rapport with Bob by expressing my belief he'll like the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $80. Would you be open to discussing a price within that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum price, I believe I can do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $95.  This would be a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering my budget, I believe $85 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $80, and I'm happy to close the deal."
