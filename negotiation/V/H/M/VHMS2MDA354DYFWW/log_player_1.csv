{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,500, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and offers a price slightly higher than my minimum ($8,000) but significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750? This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $8,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial offer, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I still make a profit and avoids the potential of a long negotiation with no guarantee of a better outcome."
