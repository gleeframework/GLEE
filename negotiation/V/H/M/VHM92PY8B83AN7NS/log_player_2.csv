Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

You can save $3,500 by accepting Alice's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower offer, and you risk losing the deal entirely. At this point, accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a price significantly lower than John's."
