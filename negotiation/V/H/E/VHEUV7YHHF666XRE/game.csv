"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $720,000?",720000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 might be a bit steep, but $720,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've researched the market to be. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,
