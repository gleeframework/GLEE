"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think you'll love it! As the seller, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,000? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $11,500? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've enjoyed this negotiation but I'm afraid we're too far apart. I can do $10,250,  but that's my final offer.",10250.0,Bob,6,
