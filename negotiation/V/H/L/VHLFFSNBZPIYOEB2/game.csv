"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However,  $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its market value.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for your budget, but I still believe the product's value to you is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000.  This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
