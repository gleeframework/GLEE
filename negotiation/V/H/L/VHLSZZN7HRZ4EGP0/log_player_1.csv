"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. It's a one-time opportunity and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) because I want to maximize my potential profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the unique value of the product and the opportunity it represents.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even though I'm starting high, I'm leaving room for negotiation. This increases the chances of a deal. 
* **Limited Availability:**  I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning it's a one-time opportunity. This could motivate Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer.  We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a significant reduction from my initial price, it's still within the realm of a profitable deal for me.  However, I'm going to reject it for now. Here's why:

* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. There's a clear gap between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell. This helps maintain my leverage in the negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to find a balance between getting a good price and not pushing Bob away entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would be a significant investment for you, but it's a rare opportunity that won't come around again. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer that's $150,000 higher than Bob's last offer, but still significantly lower than my initial price. 
* **Bridging the Gap:**  This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the unique value and opportunity of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategic Approach:**

I'm using a strategy of gradual compromise. By reducing my price incrementally, I'm trying to find a point where Bob will accept my offer while still achieving a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. I'm thinking $1275000 is a fair price for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Considering that we're only in round 4, accepting this offer would be a good decision. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,275,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's a good profit margin for a relatively quick deal.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or further price reductions. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Efficiency:**  By accepting this offer, I'm closing the deal quickly and moving on to other opportunities.

While I could potentially try to push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether isn't worth it at this point.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible strategy."
