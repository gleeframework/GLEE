,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. $1,275,000 is my final offer. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
