Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering it's worth significantly more to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting a good profit, exceeding your $10,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation, as the product is worth more to Bob.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're serious about selling while leaving room for negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob reacts and adjust our strategy based on his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to negotiate a better price. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still significantly above your minimum of $10,000, but it's lower than your initial offer of $14,000.  This means there's still room for negotiation, and we can try to secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

We'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $13,000? It's a fair price that considers your value for the product and my desire to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  We're meeting Bob halfway by lowering our price from $14,000 to $13,000.
* **Showing Flexibility:** This shows Bob that we're open to negotiation and willing to find a compromise.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $13,000 is still significantly higher than our minimum of $10,000, ensuring a good profit.

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer and continue negotiating to achieve the best possible outcome!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 away from our previous counteroffer of $13,000.
* **Good Profit:**  This price still brings us a significant profit above our minimum of $10,000. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away altogether.  It's a good idea to secure a sale at this point.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option, as it ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
