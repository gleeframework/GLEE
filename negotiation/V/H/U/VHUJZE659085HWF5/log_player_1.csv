Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob.  While you want to maximize your profit, offering it at double the value is unlikely to be successful. A price of $10,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still securing you a significant profit.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $8,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob, allowing you to be firmer on your price."
