{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $13,500 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too high:**  It's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay, making it likely he'll consider it.
* **It establishes a strong position:** By starting high, you signal you believe in the value of your product. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your negotiation skills."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $11,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below your minimum price, but you should reject the offer and make a counteroffer. It's likely Bob is willing to pay more, but you need to push him a little. You should aim for a price closer to your initial offer, as you're still confident in the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,750?  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a reasonable price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $12,250. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and your desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $250 above your minimum price of $12,000 and is close enough to your initial offer that accepting is the best strategy. It's worth more than selling to John and gives you a better starting point for future negotiations."
