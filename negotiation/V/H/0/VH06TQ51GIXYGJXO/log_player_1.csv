Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $1,900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,900,000) leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Confidence:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 
* **Safety Net:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000. This eliminates the risk of losing the sale entirely. 

**Next Steps:**

We'll need to be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters our initial offer. Understanding his motivations and flexibility will be key to reaching a deal that works for both of us."
