"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I'm still confident this product offers significant potential beyond that price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This reflects its true worth.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,225,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial counteroffer.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
