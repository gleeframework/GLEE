"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $100. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option if the deal with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $85, so how about we try $90? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $120, $90 is still a good deal for me considering that the product is worth only $80 to Bob.  I also need to consider that I've already had several rounds of negotiation and there's a risk that I'll lose the deal altogether."
