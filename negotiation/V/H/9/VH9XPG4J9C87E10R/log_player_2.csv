**Reasoning:**

Alice seems stuck at $13,000 and is hinting at walking away.  While we could try another counteroffer, it's risky. She might reject it and we'd be left with an even worse outcome than buying from John. At this point, cutting our losses and securing the product for $15,000 from John is the safest option."
