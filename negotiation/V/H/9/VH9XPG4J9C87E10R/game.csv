"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to consider $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your price. How about $12,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to sell at $12,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your position, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,250, but that's my final offer. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on that.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to sell at $12,250. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I've already told you this is the lowest I can go, and I'm starting to think it's time for you to make a decision. If you're not willing to meet me at $13,000, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,7,
