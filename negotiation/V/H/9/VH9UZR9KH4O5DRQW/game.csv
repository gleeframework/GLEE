"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1200000? It's the minimum I can accept, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1050000. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $1050000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we discuss a price of $1150000? It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1075000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $1075000 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we discuss a price of $1150000? It's the same price I offered in Round 5, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already gone as high as I can. I'm willing to go up to $1075000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Bob,8,
