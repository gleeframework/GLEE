``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while recognizing that I might need to compromise to secure a deal. I also have the option to sell to John for a higher price if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find common ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a fair value. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with another offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.
