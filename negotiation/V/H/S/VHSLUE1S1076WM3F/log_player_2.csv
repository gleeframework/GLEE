I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it just as much as I do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
