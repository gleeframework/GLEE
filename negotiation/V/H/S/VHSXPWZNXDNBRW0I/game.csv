"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. While I'm open to negotiating, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product. Let's compromise: I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for you to benefit as well.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
