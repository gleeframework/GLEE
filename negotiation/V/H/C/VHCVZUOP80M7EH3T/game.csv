,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is the absolute maximum I can afford right now. Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $125 as a final offer. This is a significant discount, and I won't be able to go any lower.",125.0,Alice,5,
