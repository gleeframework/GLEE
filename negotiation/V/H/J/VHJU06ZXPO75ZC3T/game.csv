"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $155 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $147.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",147.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $152.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think!",152.5,Alice,5,
