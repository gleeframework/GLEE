Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it holds significant value and this price reflects that."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):** I'm starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but not so high that it's insulting. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" I'm planting a seed about the product's worth without explicitly revealing my bottom line. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts, I get a great deal.
2. **Understand Bob's position:** His response (accept, counter, or walk) will reveal how much he truly values the product. 
3. **Leave room for negotiation:** We can work towards a mutually agreeable price.

I'm ready to negotiate down, but I'll keep John's $15,000 offer in mind as my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  I need to guide him closer to my range. Rejecting his offer signals that I'm serious about the product's value and willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  If this product really meets your needs, let's find a compromise. Would you be willing to consider $18,000?"" , ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement and Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and his budget concerns, showing that I'm willing to work with him. Using phrases like ""compromise"" and ""meet in the middle"" can facilitate a more collaborative negotiation.
* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** I'm dropping my price considerably to show flexibility, but I'm still staying safely above my $15,000 minimum and closer to my initial offer.  
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""Would you be willing to consider..."" is less aggressive than stating a price outright and encourages Bob to respond with his thoughts. 
 
I'm hoping Bob will make a counteroffer somewhere between $12,000 and $18,000, which will allow us to potentially close the deal above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is below my initial target, but it's above my absolute minimum of $15,000. Holding out for a higher price from Bob risks losing him as a buyer altogether. It's time to make a deal and secure a profit."
