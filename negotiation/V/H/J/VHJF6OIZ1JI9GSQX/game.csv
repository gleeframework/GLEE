"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you'd like to pay $1,100,000. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,150,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,225,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
