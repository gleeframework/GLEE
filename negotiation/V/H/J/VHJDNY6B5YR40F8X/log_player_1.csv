"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and what his budget might be. It also gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell to Bob for $8,000, it's important to remember my goal is to maximize my earnings.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little.  I'm still early in the negotiation and have many rounds to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves me with a profit above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob has dropped his offer to $7,000, which is below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him higher.  I still have a few rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $8,000.  If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500.  This is a small step down from my last offer, but it shows that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob.  Hopefully, he'll see this as a reasonable price and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than accepting a price that's far below my minimum."
