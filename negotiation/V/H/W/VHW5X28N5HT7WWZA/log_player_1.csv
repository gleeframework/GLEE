Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $950,000.  Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $950,000 allows for negotiation room while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Acknowledging Bob's value:** Mentioning the product's value to him helps build rapport and shows I'm willing to work with him.
* **Open to discussion:**  ""Let's discuss further"" invites negotiation and avoids a hard-line stance.

This approach aims to:

* Secure a good price.
* Encourage Bob to counter-offer and continue the negotiation.
* Maintain the option to sell to John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get more.
* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows for continued negotiation, potentially pushing the price closer to my ideal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John would be quick and guaranteed but leaves money on the table. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full value for both of us. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $925,000. This compromise ensures a fair deal for both of us and keeps us on track to finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of rejecting outright, I'm offering a counter-offer that shows I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Emphasize fairness:** Highlighting that the new price is a ""fair deal"" for both of us reinforces the idea of a win-win situation.
* **Keep negotiations moving:**  The ""finalize this transaction"" language adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.

This approach aims to:

*  Secure a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
*  Show flexibility and willingness to find a common ground.
*  Increase the chances of closing the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.**  $875,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to change much.**  Bob's ""final offer"" suggests he's not willing to budge much further.
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing the negotiation could be time-consuming and may not result in a better price.

**Selling to John is the most logical choice in this situation:**

* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer of $800,000 ensures I meet my minimum requirement.
* **Reduces risk:**  Continuing with Bob might lead to a prolonged negotiation that could end in a lower price or even no deal. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling now allows me to move on to other potential buyers or opportunities."
