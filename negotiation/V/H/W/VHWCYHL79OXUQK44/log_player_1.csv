"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While selling to John for $100 is tempting, I'd rather see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next rounds with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counter-offering with $120. This is still a decent margin for me and hopefully more enticing to Bob than his initial $80 offer.  It also shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  Since I have more rounds left, I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counter-offering with $110. This is a compromise, but still a good price for me.  Since Bob seems to be willing to negotiate, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $95 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, I still have a few rounds left and want to see if I can get a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can convince Bob to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counter-offering with $105. This is my final compromise.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John for $100."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100.  While Bob's offer of $98 is tempting, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale."
