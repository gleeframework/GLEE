Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value this product holds for me, $900000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This price is fair, considering the value to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to make this work.
