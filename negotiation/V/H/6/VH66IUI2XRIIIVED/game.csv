"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that's worth $800000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value this product holds for me, $900000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This price is fair, considering the value to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $950000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value it holds for me, while also being closer to your desired price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $950000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875000, which reflects a compromise on both our ends. This price is still below your value, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Alice,5,
