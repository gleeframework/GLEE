"I appreciate your time and effort in offering the product to me. However, I'm on a tight budget, and $17,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, considering the value of this product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it agreeable. Let me know your thoughts.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually agreeable price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
