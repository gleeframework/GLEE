"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd like to offer you $1,100,000 for it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $1,300,000. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering its value to you is $1,500,000.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
