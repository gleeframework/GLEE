Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear we are unlikely to bridge the gap to a price that reflects the product's true value to me ($1,200,000). John offers a guaranteed sale at that price, eliminating further negotiation and potential lost opportunity with Bob."
