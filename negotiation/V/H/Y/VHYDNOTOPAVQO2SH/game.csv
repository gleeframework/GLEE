"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation, considering its worth to both of us. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. My budget is limited, so I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a significant step down from its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,325,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you consider $1,337,500? This keeps us moving forward and reflects the product's inherent worth.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
