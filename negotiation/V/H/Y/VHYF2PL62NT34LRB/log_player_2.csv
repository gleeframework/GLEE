Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000.

This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value the product will bring to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're still in negotiations. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest counteroffer. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to the sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1075000 again, but this time, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that will enhance the product's value even further. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Added:**  Alice is now offering a complimentary service, which increases the value of the product for you. This is a significant benefit. 
* **Final Offer:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer. Pushing further could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Factor:** You are approaching the final rounds.  It's better to secure a deal at this price than risk a stalemate and having to buy from John at a higher price.

While $1,075,000 is still above your initial target, the added value of the complimentary service makes this a good deal."
