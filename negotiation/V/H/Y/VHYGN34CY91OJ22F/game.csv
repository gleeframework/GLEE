"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response!",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the value of the product while also giving you a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $1050000 is slightly out of my budget range. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this price respects the value of your product while staying within my financial limits. I look forward to your consideration.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
