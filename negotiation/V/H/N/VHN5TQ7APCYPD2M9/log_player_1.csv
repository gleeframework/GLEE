Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially landing a price higher than our fallback of $12,000.
* **Confident but not Greedy:**  The message is confident in the product's value, justifying the price while not being overly aggressive.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit from Bob while ensuring a sale is made."
