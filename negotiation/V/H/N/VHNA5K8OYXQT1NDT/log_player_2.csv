{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above his maximum budget. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his $10,000 limit as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and a good starting point for negotiation. This price is also likely to be attractive to Alice as it's still above her minimum desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is within Bob's budget. While he would ideally like to pay less, this offer is a good compromise. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves $1,000 compared to buying from John."
