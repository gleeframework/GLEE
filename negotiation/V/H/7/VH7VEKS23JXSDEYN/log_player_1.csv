"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while also giving you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price.  How about we meet at $1,300,000?  I think that's a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price and I'm only 4 rounds into the negotiation. While I could potentially get a higher price, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I don't want to risk selling to John for significantly less. Accepting this offer is the most secure option."
