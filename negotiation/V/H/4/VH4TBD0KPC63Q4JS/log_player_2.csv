"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to your desired price, you can still save $200,000 by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  It's always worth trying to negotiate further before committing to a price that's higher than your ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  Offering $850,000 is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $1,000,000, but it's still within your budget and gives you room to potentially negotiate further. This initial counteroffer signals your seriousness about buying the product while also showing you're willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant compromise from her previous offer of $1,000,000.  While it's still $100,000 higher than your ideal price, it's a better deal than buying from John for $800,000.  Furthermore, the risk of further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or even a higher price from Alice.  At this point, it's advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product for a price within your budget."
