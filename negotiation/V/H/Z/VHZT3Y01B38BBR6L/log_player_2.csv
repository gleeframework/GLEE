"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can do better. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a lower price.  There's a good chance she'll come back with a better offer since the product is only worth $80 to her.  You still have the option to buy from John for $120 as a last resort."
