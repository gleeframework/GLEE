"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $500 gap allows for negotiation without feeling pressured to sell for my minimum.
* **Plan for the Future:**  I'm setting the stage for potential counteroffers and future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I have the leverage of knowing John is willing to pay $8,000.
* **Strategic Play:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to hold out for a better price and potentially make him increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's last offer ($7,500). 
* **Showing Flexibility:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that's profitable for me.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but offering a slight increase to encourage a deal.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** With several rounds left, I'm still pushing for a higher price while remaining open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price.  By rejecting, I put pressure on Bob to increase his offer. 
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John is a good backup option, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob. 
* **Rounds Remaining:**  We still have several rounds left to negotiate, so I'm not feeling rushed to make a decision yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it well above my minimum.  This shows I'm open to negotiation but not desperate to sell.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($8,750) and Bob's latest offer ($7,750).  
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  With each round, I'm gradually getting closer to Bob's offers, keeping the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Calculating Risk:**  I'm assessing the risk of going too high and potentially losing the deal to John's guaranteed offer.  At this price, I'm taking a calculated risk, but I still believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price ($8,000), but it's still below it.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are getting near the end of the negotiation process. With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing.
* **Guaranteed Offer:** John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 is a safe and reliable option. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance I could get Bob to increase his offer, the potential gain is small and the risk of losing the deal is high.  Selling to John ensures a profit and avoids the risk of not reaching a deal."
