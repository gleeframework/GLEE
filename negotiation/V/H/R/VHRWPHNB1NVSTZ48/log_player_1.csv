""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,950,000. This product's value is truly exceptional and will yield substantial returns for you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we're still significantly above his perceived value of $1,200,000. It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can reach a price closer to $1,800,000.  We are still above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to reach a price that fits within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough call! Bob is getting closer to our bottom line, and we still have a good amount over John's offer. However, we're reaching a point where further negotiation might not yield much. 

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Accepting $1,600,000 gives us a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds. It's a strong deal at this point in the negotiation."
