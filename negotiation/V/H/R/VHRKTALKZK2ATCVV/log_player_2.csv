"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,500. While this is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation to get a better deal.
* **Strategy:**  Reject the initial offer and counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm looking to save a bit more, though. How about $8,500? This price is still fair for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can agree on."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Maximize savings.
* **Initial Offer:** Alice's offer is still too high. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** A significant drop to $8,500 is a bold move. This shows Bob's intent to negotiate aggressively and potentially pushes Alice to be more flexible.  It's also worth noting that this offer is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting again allows Bob to continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  There are still rounds remaining to potentially get a better deal.  Buying from John at this point would be a missed opportunity for potential savings."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $8,750 for the product.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Get the best price possible while still ensuring a deal.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about the distance between our offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with. Let's close this deal and avoid going to John."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Get the best price possible while still ensuring a deal.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,100 is still too high.  
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** This is a significant move - it's a substantial increase from Bob's previous offer, but it's a clear signal that he's willing to compromise and reach an agreement. The message also emphasizes the potential for missing out on a deal if they continue to haggle. This could motivate Alice to accept the offer and avoid potentially losing the sale entirely."
