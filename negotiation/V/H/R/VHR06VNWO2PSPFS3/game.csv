"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 right now. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800000 is certainly a starting point, I'm looking for a bit more to justify the value it offers. I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This price still reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning this product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $850000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in your product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
