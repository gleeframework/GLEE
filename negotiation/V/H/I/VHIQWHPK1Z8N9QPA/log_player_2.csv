"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no need to rush into a deal that's significantly over your limit, especially since you have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a good middle ground, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than your budget. You want to save as much money as possible and can still potentially negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to explore further compromises."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can reach a deal if we meet in the middle.  How about $10,500? This would allow both of us to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $13,000. How about we meet at $12,750? This way, I can still make a profit, and you'll get a great deal on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred price point.  You have 5 rounds remaining and can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,750 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but you can still do better.  You have 3 rounds remaining and can still try to negotiate a lower price.  You're only $1,500 away from your target price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. This is my last chance to get a good deal, and I'm counting on you to meet me halfway. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high for me.  I have only one round left and I don't think I can negotiate down any further. It's best to move on to a different seller.  It's more important to stick to my budget and  I can buy the product from John for $10,000, which is the best price I can get right now."
