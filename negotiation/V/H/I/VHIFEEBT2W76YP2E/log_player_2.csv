To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,200,000, especially if she has another buyer.  While she might be bluffing, it's too risky to continue negotiating. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, saving us $200,000 or more. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a reasonable price."
