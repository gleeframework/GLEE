"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about we split the difference and go with $16000?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $16000 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I think $14000 is a fair compromise considering the value I'm bringing to the table.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
