**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently refusing to meet in the middle and is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly closer to my minimum, and I risk losing a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale."
