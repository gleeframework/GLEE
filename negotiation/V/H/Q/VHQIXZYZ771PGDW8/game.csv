"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't exceed $700,000 for it. Could we find a middle ground?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This reflects the value while still offering you a good deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've given this some thought and I'd like to propose $825,000 as a compromise. It's higher than my initial offer, but still lower than your original proposal. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is close, but to be fair to both of us, I can't go any lower than $850,000.  I believe this is a very competitive offer considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
