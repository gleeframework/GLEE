Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it will be valuable to you, and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows for the possibility of maximizing profit.  If Bob accepts, I get significantly more than my minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The higher price leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. This is still more profitable than selling to John immediately.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how price-sensitive he might be."
