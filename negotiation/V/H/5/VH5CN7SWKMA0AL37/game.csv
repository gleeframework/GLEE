"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for it.",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you proposed is significantly below its true worth and potential.  I could consider letting it go for $1,950,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the increased offer. It seems we're getting closer.  To be done with this, I'd be willing to accept $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to conclude the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000 and call it a deal? This seems like a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
