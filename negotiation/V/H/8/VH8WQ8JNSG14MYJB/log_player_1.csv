Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price point considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer needs to be enticing enough to beat John's guaranteed $10,000 offer.

This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product at a price slightly below his perceived value, and Alice maximizes her profit beyond John's offer."
