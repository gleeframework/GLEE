"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $850,000 is still a little steep for me. How about $775,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is still a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
