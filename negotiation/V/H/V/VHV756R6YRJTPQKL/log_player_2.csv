"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this product, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still costs more than what the product is worth to Bob.  Bob can get the product for $150 from John, which is his maximum price.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy for Bob."
