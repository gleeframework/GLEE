Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less than this amount.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $400,000.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance to make a deal with Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but not so high that Bob walks away.  There are a few approaches:

1. **Aggressive:** Start very close to Bob's valuation (e.g., $1,100,000). This leaves less room for negotiation but could lead to the highest profit. There's a higher risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

2. **Moderate:**  Choose a price point that splits the potential profit (e.g., $1,000,000). This shows willingness to compromise and might feel fairer to Bob, increasing the chance of acceptance.

3. **Conservative:** Start lower (e.g., $900,000), ensuring a sale but leaving potential profit on the table. This minimizes the risk of losing the sale to John.

**The Offer (Moderate Approach)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This represents a fair deal given its potential for your business."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Direct:** The message gets straight to the point of offering the product and the price.
* **Value Emphasis:** It subtly reminds Bob of the product's value to him.
* **Fairness:** By positioning the price as ""fair,"" you make it more palatable to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. The best approach depends on your negotiation style and your assessment of Bob's willingness to pay."
