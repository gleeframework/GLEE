"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we negotiate, I'd like to start with an offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $775,000? This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a reasonable profit while also recognizing your interest in the product.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I believe the product is valuable, $775,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?  I feel that would be a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. How about we meet at $725,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
