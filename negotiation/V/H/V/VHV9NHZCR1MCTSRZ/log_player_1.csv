{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it.  While this is a significant investment, I am confident that the benefits will outweigh the cost. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions. I'm available to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've chosen $1,750,000.  This is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message is designed to be persuasive and emphasizes the value Bob will gain from the product. 
* **Plan:** This strategy aims to maximize profit while still potentially securing a sale with Bob.  If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale with John, ensuring I get at least my minimum value."
