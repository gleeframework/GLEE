Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000. This reflects the maximum I can pay while still making this a worthwhile purchase for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This shows my commitment to making this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear we're unlikely to reach a price that significantly surpasses John's guaranteed offer of $800,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob introduces risk with potentially little reward. Accepting John's offer guarantees a fair price without further haggling."
