"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $8800. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",8800.0,Alice,5,
