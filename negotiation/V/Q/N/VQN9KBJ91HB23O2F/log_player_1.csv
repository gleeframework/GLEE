"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, aiming for a price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob. This is a gamble, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit. If he rejects it, I can adjust my approach in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept and secure a quick sale, I believe I can push for a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer. This is a compromise, but I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm not ready to settle yet.  I believe I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm further lowering my price to $1,550,000,  which is just $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can secure a higher price from Bob.  He's clearly unwilling to budge much further, and I've already lowered my price considerably. While it's frustrating to not get my desired price, selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees I meet my minimum requirement and avoid any further risk in the negotiation."
