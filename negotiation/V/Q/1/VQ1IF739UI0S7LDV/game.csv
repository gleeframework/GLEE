"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That way, we both get a good deal.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I understand that $65 was a bit low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $80?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
