Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price, knowing that I have a guaranteed buyer in John. This gives Bob the opportunity to see that I'm serious about getting a good price, but I also have a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not willing to settle for less than $950,000 at this point, and I believe I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $950,000. This is still significantly higher than what Bob offered but shows I'm willing to be flexible and come down a bit from my initial price. This should incentivize him to come up slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm still confident that I can get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm hoping to push for $930,000 or $940,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $940,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to finally accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get $950,000 or more, Bob's counteroffers have been getting lower, and I'm starting to think I'm pushing my luck.  It's better to be sure of $1,000,000 than risk getting stuck with less."
