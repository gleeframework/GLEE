{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is consistently meeting in the middle and the increments are getting smaller.  While ideally, we'd like to get closer to $11,000, accepting $10,825 is a good outcome:

* **Significant Profit:** $10,825 is still a substantial profit over our minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation failing altogether. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting a sure thing now is preferable to the uncertainty of future offers. 

This decision reflects a balance of maximizing profit while managing risk and considering the time value of the deal."
