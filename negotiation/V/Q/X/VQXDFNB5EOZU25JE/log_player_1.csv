Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and it's a fair price for me considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $15,000. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This gives us both a good profit margin. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than $10,000 from John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $14,000.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial offer, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired $14,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if things don't work out, I'm prepared to sell to John for $10,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  Let's compromise and meet in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $13,500. How about we settle on $13,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,000.  While I was hoping for $13,500, $13,000 is still a good deal for me, and it allows me to close the deal without further negotiation.  There's a risk of further rounds leading to a lower price, or Bob getting impatient and walking away. Accepting his offer now guarantees a good profit."
