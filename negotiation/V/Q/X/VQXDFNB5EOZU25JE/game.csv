"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and it's a fair price for me considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $15,000. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This gives us both a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial offer, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  Let's compromise and meet in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,5,
