Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. 

**Here's the offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **""Initially proposing""**: This language subtly suggests there might be room for negotiation without explicitly saying it. 
* **Price:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for you to potentially come down a bit while still staying well above your minimum.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to negotiate, but stand firm on not going below your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **John as Leverage:**  While you don't want to threaten Bob, you can subtly imply you have other interested parties if he hesitates."
