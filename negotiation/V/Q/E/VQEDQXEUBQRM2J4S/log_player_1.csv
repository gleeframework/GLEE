Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counter, allowing for a back-and-forth.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us, creating a sense of win-win.

**Important Notes:**

*  I'm aware that this is just the first round.  
* I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. 
* I'm ready to consider selling to John at $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $550,000. It's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $550,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, there's still potential for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price by counter-offering.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a huge financial loss.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground with Bob. 
* I will continue to consider selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail to yield a satisfactory outcome."

Round 4
