"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,000? This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
