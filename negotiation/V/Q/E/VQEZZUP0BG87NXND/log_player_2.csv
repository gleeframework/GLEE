"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product from John for $120, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer.  Rejecting and proceeding to the next round allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It's also below my maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer. While I could continue to try and negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially driving the price up again is too high.  Accepting her offer allows me to secure the product at a good price."
