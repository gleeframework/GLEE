Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for it, which still represents a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
