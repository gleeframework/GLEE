Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I believe it could benefit you greatly. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to accept. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John.

Offering the product at $11,500 creates a win-win situation:

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob gets a $1,500 discount from his perceived value.
* **Alice's Perspective:** Alice makes $1,500 more than selling to John. 

This strategy aims for the highest possible price Bob might accept, exceeding the backup offer."
