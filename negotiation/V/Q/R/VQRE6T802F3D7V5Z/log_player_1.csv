"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a high starting point, but I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate.  I'm leaving some room for him to bargain, but I still want to get as close to the $150 value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is too low.  I want to get closer to my target.  I will counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$115 is still a bit low. I want to keep pushing for a higher price, and see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
``` 
I'm going to counter with $125.  This is a compromise between his offer and my previous counteroffer. I want to see if we can reach an agreement now.  I'm getting a little concerned that we might not be able to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob is not budging much. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might walk away. I'd rather sell the product to John for $100 than risk getting nothing at all."
