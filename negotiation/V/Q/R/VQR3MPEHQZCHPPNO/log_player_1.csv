Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to, while still ensuring you get a significantly higher price than John's offer. 
* **Don't Price Yourself Out:**  If you ask for $120 right away, Bob has no incentive to accept since his perceived value is equal to the price. 

By offering the product at $115, you strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
