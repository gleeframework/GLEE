"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal for my product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
