Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
