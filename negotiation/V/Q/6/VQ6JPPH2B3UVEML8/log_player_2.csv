{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. There are still 9 rounds to go, and Bob has a clear understanding of the product's value to both himself and Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting with a counteroffer that's $2,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but Bob is confident he can negotiate further if necessary. He's also aware that Alice's value for the product is $10,000, meaning there's still room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
