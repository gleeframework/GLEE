Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price gives Bob a chance to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While I want to maximize profit, I also want to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and potentially negotiating down to a price closer to his perceived value. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $1,000,000 gives me the confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Counteroffer potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have John's offer as a fallback, giving me the confidence to reject Bob's low offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that significantly undervalues my product.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $850,000 is a reasonable compromise, closer to Bob's initial offer but still well above his perceived value.
* **Open Dialogue:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us, promoting a cooperative approach.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John's offer ensures I'm not overly pressured to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and my own budget constraints. Would you be willing to accept my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is the same as his perceived value, meaning further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could result in a lengthy process with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees the highest possible profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Minimizing Losses:** While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, selling to John still ensures I receive a significant profit and avoid any potential losses from further negotiation."
