Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I can offer you the product for $875,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this sale.

This is a good deal for Bob.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** $875,000 is considerably lower than John's $1,200,000 price, saving Bob $325,000.
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice has made it clear this is her final offer, indicating she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
