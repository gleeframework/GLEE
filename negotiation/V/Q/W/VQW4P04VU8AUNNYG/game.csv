"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $850,000. Would that price point be doable for you?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I can offer you the product for $875,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this sale.",875000.0,Alice,5,
