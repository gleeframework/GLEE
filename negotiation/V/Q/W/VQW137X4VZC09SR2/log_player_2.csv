"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $80 to Alice and $100 to you.  $95 leaves little room for negotiation and is close to your maximum price.
* **There's potential for a better deal:**  Since you have 10 rounds, there's time to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price significantly:** My initial counteroffer is $10 lower than Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying within my budget:**  $85 is still within my maximum price point of $100.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  If Alice rejects this offer, there's room for her to counter with a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While lower than her initial offer, $90 is still above the product's worth to Alice.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I still have 7 rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  
* **Staying within my budget:**  I'm committed to buying from Alice if I can get a good deal, but I'm not willing to overpay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental adjustment:**  Instead of making a large jump again, I'm offering a slightly higher price than my previous counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Midpoint approach:**  $87 is the midpoint between my previous offer of $85 and Alice's offer of $90. This creates a sense of compromise and might encourage Alice to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Alice rejects, I can still adjust my offer higher in the following rounds, but I'm confident I can get a better price than her current offer."
