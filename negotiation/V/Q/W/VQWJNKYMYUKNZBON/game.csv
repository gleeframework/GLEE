"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,000. Is this a more acceptable price for you?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. This is my best price, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,5,
