Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. This is my best price, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge much lower than $9,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal or missing out altogether. John's offer is the best guarantee of getting a price you're comfortable with."
