{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer. You've negotiated as much as you can with Alice, and you're unlikely to get much closer to your target price. It's better to secure the product at $120 with John than to risk getting stuck at a higher price with Alice."
