"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,700,000 is a little too low for me to accept, but I'm motivated to close this deal.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,850,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
