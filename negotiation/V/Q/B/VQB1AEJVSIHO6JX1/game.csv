"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you showing interest. While $900,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,050,000? ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
