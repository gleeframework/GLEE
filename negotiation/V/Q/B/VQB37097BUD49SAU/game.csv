"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it, and it's a significant saving for you as well. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a significant discount from the original price, I'm still not willing to part with the product for that low of a price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging the discount you're looking for.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,100,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to $1,050,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging the discount you're looking for. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
