{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $11,500. I think you'll find this a very fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000.

Offering the product at $11,500 gives Bob a potential gain of $1,500 ($11,500 - $10,000). This is a significant saving for him and makes it more likely he'll accept. 

By starting at $11,500, you leave room to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back but still ensures you make a profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase."
