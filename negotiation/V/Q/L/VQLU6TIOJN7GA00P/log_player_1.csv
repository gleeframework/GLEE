Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good profit margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'm hoping this initial offer will get the ball rolling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $150, so I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $175.  This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's more appealing to Bob than his previous offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum. I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the sale. It's a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by being too stubborn."
