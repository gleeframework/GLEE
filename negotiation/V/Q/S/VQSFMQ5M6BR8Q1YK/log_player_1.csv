Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer just yet. I believe the product is worth more than $1,300,000 and I'm confident we can find a compromise. I'll send him a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $1,300,000. This is my final offer. Is it acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time. It's better to accept his offer than risk losing the deal and getting only $1,000,000 from John."
