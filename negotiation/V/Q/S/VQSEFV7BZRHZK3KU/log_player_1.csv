Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob before moving to your backup offer.

**Strategic Offering**

The goal is to find a price that maximizes your profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept. Here's a possible strategy:

1. **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  Don't start at $1,500,000. While that's Bob's maximum, it leaves no room for negotiation and might scare him off. 
2. **Consider a Range:** Offer a price that gives you a significant profit but leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the product's exclusivity and value.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,350,000 gives you a $350,000 profit margin over your guarantee, while still leaving $150,000 of potential value on the table for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies there might be room for discussion, but you're starting from a strong position. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob reacts will determine your next move. If he counter-offers, you'll need to negotiate further. 
* **Your Bottom Line:** Remember, you always have John's $1,000,000 offer as a safety net. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet you at a price that benefits both of you."
