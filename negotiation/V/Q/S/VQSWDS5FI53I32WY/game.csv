"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This price reflects its value and allows for a healthy profit for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to make this deal work,  $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a great value.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,275,000.  Would that be workable for you?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $1,275,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  This final offer is a compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
