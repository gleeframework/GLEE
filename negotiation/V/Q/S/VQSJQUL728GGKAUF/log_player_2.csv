"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is better than her initial asking price, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you leverage to either get a better deal from Alice or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
