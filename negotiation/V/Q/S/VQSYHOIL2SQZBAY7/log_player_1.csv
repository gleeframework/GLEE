Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $175 gives me room to drop the price if Bob counteroffers.
* **Motivating Bob:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" and Bob's potential happiness, aiming to pique his interest. 
* **Not selling to John yet:**  I want to explore the possibility of getting closer to my ideal price with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I can still potentially negotiate a better price with Bob.  
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me leverage in the negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $175 to $140. 
* **Maintaining my bottom line:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
