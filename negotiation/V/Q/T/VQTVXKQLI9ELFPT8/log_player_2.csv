{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer and puts pressure on her to come down.  It's also a reasonable price point for me, leaving some room for compromise."
