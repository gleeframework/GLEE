"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value, but I believe my initial offer is closer to reflecting the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for you.  Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
