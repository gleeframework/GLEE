"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $200 is far above your budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with John's deal."
