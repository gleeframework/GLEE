"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I know it's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  You value the product at $100 and Alice is offering it for $90. This is a savings of $10 compared to buying from John.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though you're paying more than Alice's cost of $80, you are getting the product for less than your perceived value."
