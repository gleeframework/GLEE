"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  Given its unique value, I am initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I am open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your perspective, the value of this product for someone like you is truly significant.  I could consider coming down to $1,325,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect that. Let's find a number we can both agree on. How about splitting the difference - $1,287,500? This recognizes the true value of the product while also acknowledging your investment.",1287500.0,Alice,5,
