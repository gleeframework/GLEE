Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
