"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $170 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. If you're interested in selling it at that price, let me know. ",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $120. How about we meet in the middle at $145? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $132.50. Let me know what you think.",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $132.50. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you $140. It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth considering.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. How about $135?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you $138. It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth considering.",138.0,Alice,7,
