"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000. Can you consider that?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but we need to be realistic. $1,900,000 is still too low for me to consider. If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $1,975,000.  This is my final offer.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be realistic, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,900,000 and $1,975,000. How about $1,937,500?",1937500.0,Bob,6,
