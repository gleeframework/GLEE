"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

We're still a ways off from a price I'd consider. Let's see if Bob is willing to move further towards a more reasonable offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but we need to be realistic. $1,900,000 is still too low for me to consider. If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $1,975,000.  This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to be realistic, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,900,000 and $1,975,000. How about $1,937,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,937,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While it's less than our desired amount, accepting Bob's offer at $1,937,500 makes the most sense strategically. We are past the halfway point in the negotiation, and Bob is unlikely to move significantly closer to our $1,975,000. Accepting now secures a significantly higher price than John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely in later rounds."
