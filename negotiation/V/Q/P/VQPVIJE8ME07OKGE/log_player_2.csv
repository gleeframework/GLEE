Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think I can do better than that. How about we meet at $100? It's a great price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

It's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that's close to my budget. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer of $80."
