"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm starting with a friendly message, highlighting the potential value to Bob, to build a positive rapport. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he'll immediately counter with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below the $80 I'm willing to accept. 
* **Opportunity for more:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is closer to my expectations, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not giving up on the deal.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  By suggesting $105, I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reiterating the potential value to Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $97 is very close to my minimum price of $80.
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid selling to John at a lower price. 
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though I'm getting closer to my minimum, I've established a positive negotiation with Bob, which might lead to future deals where I can get a better price."
