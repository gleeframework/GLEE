"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above Bob's target price of $1,500,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to consider my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's target price, $1,100,000 is still above Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but my final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My final counteroffer is $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still above the $1,000,000 that Bob believes is a fair price. Bob has already made a final offer and it's in his best interest to continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to his target.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to meet your target, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. I'm confident this is the best deal we can reach."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. My next offer is $1,050,000 is too high for you, so I'll try $1,037,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  Alice's offer of $1,037,500 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,025,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer.  If Bob rejects, there's a high chance the negotiation will break down. 
* **Better than John:**  Even at $1,037,500, Bob is saving significantly compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.

While Bob could try to negotiate a bit lower, the potential for the deal to fall apart is high. It's a calculated risk, but accepting Alice's offer is the most logical move at this point."
