,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to consider my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but my final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My final counteroffer is $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to meet your target, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, which is a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. I'm confident this is the best deal we can reach.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. My next offer is $1,050,000 is too high for you, so I'll try $1,037,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1037500.0,Alice,7,
