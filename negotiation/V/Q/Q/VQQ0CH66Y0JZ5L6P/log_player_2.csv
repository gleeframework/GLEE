{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,500 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to pay $11,000. This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable going to John for $12,000 if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $10,800 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly, and you're now within your budget.

Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
