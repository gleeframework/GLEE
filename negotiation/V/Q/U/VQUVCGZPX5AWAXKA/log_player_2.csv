Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,001.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if you can get a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm definitely interested. However, $1,200,001 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is right at your maximum price point. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price will increase in subsequent rounds, or Alice could reject your counteroffers.  John is offering the product at your exact maximum, so it's a safe bet to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
