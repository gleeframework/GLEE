"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above my ideal value for the product. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's significantly closer to my target than her initial offer.  It's also a good compromise, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal from Alice. If I reject her offer, I risk her sticking to her original price, or even raising it.  Buying from John at $12,000 is a worse deal, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
