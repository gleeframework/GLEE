Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob's offer is too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly lower than my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still allows you a profit, and it's closer to the value I'm hoping to get. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we settle at $7,000?  It's a significant move on my part, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that low. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and go with $7,500.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to go up to $7,200, but that's really the best I can do.  It's a great price for this product, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're happy with it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to my desired price with Bob's offer, I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation aren't worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. It's better to sell to John and secure the $12,000 guaranteed sale."
