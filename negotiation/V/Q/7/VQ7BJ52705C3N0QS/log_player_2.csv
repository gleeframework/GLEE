Round 3

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1075000?  This price would be fair to both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let's make this happen!
