"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $800,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. It establishes my interest while leaving room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Targeting a Good Deal:** My goal is to save as much as possible.  Even though I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000 (John's price), aiming lower initially could lead to a better outcome. 
* **Leaving Alice Room:**  Alice's product valuation is higher than mine, so there's a potential compromise zone.  My offer gives her a starting point to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the true value of this product, I could come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer reflecting its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Slow Concession:** Alice's counter-offer is a $100,000 decrease, but it's still significantly above my budget and John's price. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  I need to see how much Alice is willing to move on price.  Rejecting again shows I'm serious about a lower price point. 
* **John as Backup:** I have the security of buying from John at $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still a bit too high for my budget. I could potentially go up to $950,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:**  By increasing my offer by $150,000, I'm demonstrating willingness to move towards a compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer keeps me below my maximum price ($1,000,000) while showing Alice I'm serious about finding a deal. 
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** Her response will indicate how much lower she might be willing to go. If she's still too high, I'll have a better sense of whether to continue negotiating or go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To finalize the deal quickly, I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached My Limit:** Alice's latest offer is still $100,000 over my maximum budget and what John is offering.
* **Unlikely to Budge Further:**  Alice has made it clear she's willing to make a deal, but her price reductions indicate she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,100,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Price:**  I have a reliable alternative with John at $1,000,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation when I can secure the product at my target price elsewhere."
