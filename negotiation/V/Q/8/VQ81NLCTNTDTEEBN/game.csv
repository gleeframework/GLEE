,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105 to make this deal work.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $95 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
