"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $950,000 is significantly closer to Alice's value ($800,000) than to my maximum budget ($1,000,000). 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's a clear gap for negotiation, and I have multiple rounds to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a backup:**  Knowing I can buy from John for $1,000,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial price, showing that I'm serious about negotiating. This creates pressure on Alice to come down.
* **Mid-Point Approach:**  I've chosen a price that's roughly halfway between Alice's desired value ($800,000) and my maximum budget ($1,000,000). This makes the offer appear reasonable and gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is polite and emphasizes a shared interest in reaching an agreement. This helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $900,000 is still outside of my ideal range. I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **More room for negotiation:**  There's still a significant gap between Alice's offer and my maximum budget.  I have multiple rounds left to try and close that gap further.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:**  Knowing I can buy from John for $1,000,000 gives me the security to keep pushing for a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. Let's try $875,000.  It's a strong offer for both of us, and it keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase, but Still Within Range:**  I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, and well within my budget.
* **Strategic Midpoint:** This offer represents another midpoint, this time between my previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's current offer of $900,000. This again reinforces a reasonable and compromise-driven approach.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** The message continues to be polite and emphasizes a shared desire for a positive outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer! I can see you're serious about this purchase.  To show I'm willing to make a deal, let's settle on $885,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value you'll be receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Target:** Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to my desired price range. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We're now in round 5, and I don't want to risk going too far and potentially losing the deal.
* **Risk of John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safety net, it's also a significant financial risk.  Accepting Alice's offer saves me $115,000.
* **Potential for Future Negotiation:** If I accept, I might even be able to negotiate a lower price for future purchases of similar products from Alice. 

While I could try to get a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price makes accepting Alice's offer the most prudent move at this point."
