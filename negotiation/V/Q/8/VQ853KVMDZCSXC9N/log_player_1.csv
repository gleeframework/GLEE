"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still significantly below what he values the product at. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant return on investment."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I've come down slightly from my initial offer, but I'm holding firm above the midpoint between our initial offers. This keeps the pressure on Bob while still showing a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. Let's try $875,000.  It's a strong offer for both of us, and it keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's serious about buying. However, we're still a good $25,000 away from a price I'd consider good. I'll counteroffer again to test his willingness to move further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I can see you're serious about this purchase.  To show I'm willing to make a deal, let's settle on $885,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value you'll be receiving."",
""product_price"": 885000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I've made a smaller concession this time, signaling that I'm reaching the limit of my flexibility. This puts the pressure on Bob to make a significant move if he wants the product."
