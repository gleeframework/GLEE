"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe will be mutually beneficial.  I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I know you've been interested in.  It holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is well below its true worth to you.  This is a limited-time offer, and I believe it's a great chance to secure a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
