"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000? This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away with a decent deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
