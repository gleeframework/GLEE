# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is too high. You can do better. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there is room for negotiation. You should reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While $950,000 is a strong offer, the value this product brings to the table, particularly for someone like you, is significant. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the true potential of this product. What do you think?
