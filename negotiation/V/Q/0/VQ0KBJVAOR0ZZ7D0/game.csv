"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I'm interested in the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $10000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10000, but I have to consider the product's value and my initial investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $11500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $10750?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects both our desired outcomes.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a counteroffer of $11200. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial investment.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm still a bit hesitant at $11200.  I'm willing to go up to $11000, but I need to be confident that's a price we can both agree on.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",11000.0,Bob,6,
