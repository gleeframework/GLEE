"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $11,000, so how about $10,500? It's a fair price for this high-quality product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
