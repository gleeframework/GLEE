"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's price of $95 is lower than John's $100.
* **The product is still worth buying:** Even at $95, the product is still worth more to you than the price you're paying. You value it at $100, making it a good deal."
