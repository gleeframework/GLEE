"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this is a win-win situation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than John's offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly sees the value of the product and is willing to pay a significant amount.  I want to try to get closer to my desired price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer and still a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $880000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to $900,000, the risk of further negotiation and potentially having to accept John's offer is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer at $880,000 ensures a decent profit and avoids any potential for a loss."
