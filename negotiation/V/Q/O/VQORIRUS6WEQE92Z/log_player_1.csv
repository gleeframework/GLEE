{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to Bob's $15,000 valuation, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it would be a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000? I really think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, $12,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my desired price than John's offer, and it seems Bob is fairly set on that amount.  It's a good deal for both of us and I'm happy to accept it."
