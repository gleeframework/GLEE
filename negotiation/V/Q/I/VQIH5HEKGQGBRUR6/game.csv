"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000 for your product. This is a fair price given the value I see in it, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss this further.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet within a reasonable range. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a revised price of $1750000 for our product. This reflects a compromise that aims to balance the value provided by the product with your budgetary constraints. I am confident that this offer will enable us to reach a satisfactory agreement that meets both of our needs.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit too high for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1625000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
