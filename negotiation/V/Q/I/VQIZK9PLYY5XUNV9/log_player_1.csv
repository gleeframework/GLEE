Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to sell quickly, I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still securing a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might be time-consuming and uncertain.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value."
