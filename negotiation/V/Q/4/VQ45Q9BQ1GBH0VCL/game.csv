"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me at this point. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go as high as $900000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product for $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $1025000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1025000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm prepared to offer $975000.  This represents a significant commitment on my part and is likely the best I can do. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, but I need to think about whether I'm comfortable with that price. I'll make you a deal: I'll sell the product to you for $990000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,7,
