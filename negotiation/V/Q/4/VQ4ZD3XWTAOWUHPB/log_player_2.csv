"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could sell it for elsewhere.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than what she could sell the product for elsewhere, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  He can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is the best deal for him."
