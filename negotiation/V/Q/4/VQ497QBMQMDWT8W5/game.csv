"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is significantly below my initial assessment of the product's value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being within my means.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $1,050,000? This recognizes the true value of what's being offered while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000.
