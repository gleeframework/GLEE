Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also establishes a perceived higher value for the product. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

By offering the product at $15,000, I aim to either:

1. **Secure a higher profit** if Bob accepts the offer.
2. **Negotiate down** to a price still potentially higher than $10,000.
3. **Fall back on my guaranteed sale** to John at $10,000 if Bob rejects the offer."
