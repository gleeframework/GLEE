"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $110. I'm willing to make a compromise and sell it to you for $145. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $145 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm ready to pay $125 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you say?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $135. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $130, and I'm confident that's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Bob,6,
