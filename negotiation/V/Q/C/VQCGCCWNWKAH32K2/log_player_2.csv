"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $140 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You should reject this offer and go with the better deal."
