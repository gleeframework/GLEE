"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully incentivizes Bob to engage.  I'll be watching closely to see how he reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy Bob is willing to pay my minimum,  I'm not satisfied with that price. I believe there's still potential to get a better deal. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation while demonstrating my willingness to reach an agreement.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While it's tempting to accept Bob's offer and sell the product,  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. It's early in the negotiation process, and I believe there's still room for Bob to improve his offer. I'll counter once again to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $1,300,000. This is a small compromise but signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal. It's still above Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob has raised his offer significantly, and it's within reach of my desired price point. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by being too stubborn. I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,250,000."
