"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find very valuable, for $130. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer ($130):** While this is cheaper than John's price, it's still above your $150 limit. 
* **Your Goal:** Your goal is to save as much money as possible. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or resort to buying from John. 

Let's see if Alice might counter with a lower offer."
