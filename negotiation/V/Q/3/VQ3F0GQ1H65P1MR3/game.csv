"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,000 is still a bit much for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm trying to be flexible, but $7,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
