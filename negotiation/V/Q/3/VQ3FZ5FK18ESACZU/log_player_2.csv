"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still too high for him, as he values the product at $12,000. It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has moved a bit closer to his desired price, $9,500 is still above his personal value of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, though. I'll offer the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has to weigh his options carefully. While $9,200 is still a bit above his ideal price, it's getting close. He's only $200 away from his ideal price and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, especially considering the 10-round limit. If he rejects the offer, there's a chance Alice will hold firm at her price, and then he'd be forced to buy from John at $12,000, losing a significant amount of money. Accepting the offer allows him to buy the product at a relatively good price, saving him $2,800 compared to buying from John."
