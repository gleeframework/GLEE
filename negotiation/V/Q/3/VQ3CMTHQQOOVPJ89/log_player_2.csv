"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget ($15,000).** This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* **You don't know the product's value to Alice.** This makes it difficult to determine how low you can push the price. 

By rejecting the offer and counter-offering, you can potentially get a better price without risking going over your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer establishes your position as a serious buyer but willing to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $7,500 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise and polite, demonstrating that you're interested in the product while clearly stating your position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. $7500 is a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction:**  The price is closer to your counteroffer.
* **Still room for negotiation:** You are still well under your budget, and Alice is willing to negotiate further. 

By rejecting and counter-offering, you might be able to close the gap even further. It's worth pushing for a lower price, but be prepared to accept a price closer to $8,500 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $8,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $8,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer and your previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoned Justification:** The message highlights your interest in the product and presents the price as a fair solution.
* **Strategic Approach:**  By staying firm but reasonable, you aim to get the best possible price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
