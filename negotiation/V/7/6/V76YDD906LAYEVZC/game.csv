"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000, but I'm willing to meet you at $975000. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $975000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975000 and my previous offer of $950000. I'm thinking of $962500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",962500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not willing to go below $985000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $975000 was already my best offer, but I can do $985000 is too low for me. I'll meet you at $980000, but that's my final offer.",980000.0,Alice,7,
