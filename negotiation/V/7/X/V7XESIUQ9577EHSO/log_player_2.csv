You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's more efficient to buy from John for $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiation that might lead to a worse outcome for Bob."
