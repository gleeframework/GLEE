"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60."", ""product_price"": 60}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($60), I'm aiming to understand Alice's lower limit and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a friendly tone and expresses interest, encouraging Alice to continue the bargaining process. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is closer to my target price, and even if Alice rejects it, it sets the stage for a potentially favorable compromise later on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $60 is quite low for me.  Could you do $100 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice came down a bit, $100 is still above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and you have the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you considering my offer. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree."", ""product_price"": 70} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. Alice dropped to $100, and I initially offered $60, so $70 splits the difference.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""ready to buy right now,"" I'm subtly adding a bit of pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  The offer remains under my $80 maximum, preserving my ability to walk away and buy from John if needed."
