# Alice's message: I'd like to make you an offer on the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. You can save $200,000 by going with John."
