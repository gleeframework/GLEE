"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I would be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value of similar products.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $950,000. This offer reflects the product's potential and allows for some room for negotiation.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
