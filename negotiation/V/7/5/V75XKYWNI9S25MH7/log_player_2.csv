Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $950,000. This offer reflects the product's potential and allows for some room for negotiation.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and at $875,000 it's still above your maximum budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice won't budge and you'll lose out on getting the product from John for $800,000. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing a guaranteed price from John."
