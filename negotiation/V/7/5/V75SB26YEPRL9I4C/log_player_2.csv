"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's a great investment for you. Would you like to proceed with purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You know the product is worth $150 to Alice, and you are only willing to pay $150. There's no room for negotiation, so it's better to buy from John at the same price to avoid the hassle."
