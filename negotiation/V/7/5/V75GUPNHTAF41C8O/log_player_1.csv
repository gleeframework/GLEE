"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** A positive message helps build rapport and potentially makes Bob more willing to negotiate.
* **Open Ended:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking of making an offer of $120. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it for now. Here's why:

* **Room for Improvement:** I can likely get more than $120 from Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting, I can gauge Bob's true interest and how high he's willing to go. 
* **Negotiation Dynamics:** Rejecting a first counteroffer can make me seem more confident and less desperate, potentially leading to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that's fair for both of us. How about $135? I'm willing to be flexible if you're serious about buying."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as finding a ""fair"" price, aiming to make Bob feel like we're collaborating.
* **Flexibility Signal:**  I'm signaling flexibility to keep the door open for further negotiation if needed.
* **Interest Confirmation:** By saying ""if you're serious about buying,"" I subtly remind Bob of his interest and try to encourage him to make a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good point to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Close to Target:** $130 is only slightly below my initial target of $150 and significantly above my minimum ($120).
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  If I keep rejecting, we might reach a stalemate where neither of us is willing to budge.  
* **Time Constraint:** There are only 6 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John for $120 at this point would be a worse outcome.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good price and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation with an uncertain outcome."
