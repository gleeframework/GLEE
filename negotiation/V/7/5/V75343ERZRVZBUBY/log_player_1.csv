Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, knowing Bob's value is lower. This will force him to negotiate if he's interested. I'm also aware I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm aware of the potential to sell to John for that amount, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a better price, especially with the backup option of selling to John.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering both our previous offers.  If Bob rejects this, I'm seriously considering selling to John, as the risk of further negotiation with Bob might not be worth it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, we're still too far apart. I'm not confident I can push for a better price with another counteroffer, and the risk of further negotiation is not worth it.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids any further haggling."
