# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is manipulative. She tries to inflate the product's value to you ($12,000) while knowing her own valuation is much lower ($8,000). While $10,500 is less than your maximum budget, it's likely still a significant markup. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer or allows you to buy from John at a price closer to your limit."
