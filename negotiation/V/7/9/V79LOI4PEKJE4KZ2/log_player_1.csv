Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount and a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that is significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000) but still higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* This gives Bob a good deal, making him more likely to accept.
* If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I get my minimum value."
