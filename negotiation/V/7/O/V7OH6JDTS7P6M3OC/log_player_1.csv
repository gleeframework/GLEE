"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant amount considering its value to me.  Let's start with this offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's try to work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach a deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not convinced Bob is willing to pay a fair price. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to considering selling to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can find a way to reach an agreement.  If not, I'll need to seriously consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to what I'd like, it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to make one more counteroffer before seriously considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 as a final offer.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement before I need to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  We've reached a point where I'm confident that I can get a better price from John, so I'll go ahead and sell to him."
