Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning it's a ""limited time"" offer or a ""great deal"", you create a subtle sense of urgency and value.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and sets the stage for further negotiation. If he outright rejects $135, you can always lower the price, knowing your fallback option is selling to John for $120."
