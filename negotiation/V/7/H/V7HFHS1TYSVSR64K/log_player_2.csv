"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer at the same price. It's always better to explore other options to see if you can get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can explore other sellers and potentially negotiate a lower price."
