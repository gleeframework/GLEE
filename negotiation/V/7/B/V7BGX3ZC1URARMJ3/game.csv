"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $17,500. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about $12,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a sweet spot. While $12,500 is closer to my target, I still think it's a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $17,500, which is $12,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm willing to go up to $12,600, but that's absolutely my limit.  If that doesn't work for you, I completely understand, but I'll need to go with a different option.",12600.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $12,600. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",13000.0,Alice,7,
