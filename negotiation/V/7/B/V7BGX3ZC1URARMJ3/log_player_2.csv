"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Since I can buy the product for $15,000 from John, Alice's offer of $20,000 is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $17,500. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.

While Alice came down on her price, $17,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I know I can get it for $15,000 from John, so I'll try to negotiate further with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a sweet spot. While $12,500 is closer to my target, I still think it's a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $17,500, which is $12,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but I'm still better off buying from John at this point. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal, but if she doesn't budge, I'll go with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $12,600. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.

Alice is unwilling to meet my price target. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John for $15,000. While I could try to haggle Alice down further, it's unlikely I'll get a price that beats John's offer."
