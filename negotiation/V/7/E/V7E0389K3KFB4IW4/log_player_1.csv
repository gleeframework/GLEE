Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. It would allow you to make a profit, and I would be getting a great deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to make more, I'd rather secure the sale now and avoid further negotiation."
