"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. It would allow you to make a profit, and I would be getting a great deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
