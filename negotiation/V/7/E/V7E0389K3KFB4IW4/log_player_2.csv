"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no need to buy from John yet, as there's a chance to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Bob can get a better deal. It's also worth noting that John is offering a price that is only $100,000 higher than Bob's counteroffer. If Bob can't get a better deal from Alice, he can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. It would allow you to make a profit, and I would be getting a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
