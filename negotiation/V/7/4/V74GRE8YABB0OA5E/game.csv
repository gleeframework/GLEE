"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $12,000.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $8,900. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",8900.0,Alice,5,
