Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've started with a price of $13,000, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By offering a price below the product's worth to Bob, I encourage a counteroffer, allowing me to potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $10,000 provides me with a safety net and allows me to walk away from negotiations if the price drops too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting it would be a loss for me.
* **Potential for Better Price:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.  He's clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would be a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting a price of $12,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. This is a midpoint between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I've kept the message friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I've framed my counteroffer as a price that would be good for ""both of us"", reinforcing the idea of a win-win situation.

This counteroffer shows I'm open to negotiation but not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price. It also keeps the pressure on Bob to either accept or come up with another counteroffer."
