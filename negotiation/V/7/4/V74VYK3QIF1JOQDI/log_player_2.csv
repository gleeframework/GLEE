"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.** You'll save $600,000 ($1,500,000 - $900,000).
* **While Alice's offer is more than the product's worth to her, it's still within your budget.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so $900,000 is a good deal."
