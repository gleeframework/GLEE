Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer.  I'm confident I can get at least $150 from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to pay a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$120 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $175. This is still a fair price for me, and hopefully it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, $140 is better than my minimum of $150 and closer to what I originally wanted.  It's also better than the guaranteed $150 from John.  It's time to close the deal."
