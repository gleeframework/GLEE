"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $110.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

Thanks for getting closer to a price that works for me Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $125?,125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $125 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be very happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
