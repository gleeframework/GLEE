,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in this product, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  However, $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $115. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is closer, but I'm still a little over my budget. Let's try $105. That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal quickly.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $110. I think this product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to wait for a better offer. I'll meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
