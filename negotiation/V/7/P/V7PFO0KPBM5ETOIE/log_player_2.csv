"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your business. Given its high value and quality, I understand it might seem quite an investment. However, considering its worth to you, I propose a deal at $12,000. This price not only ensures a fair return for me but also allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable cost. I trust this proposal will meet both our expectations. Let me know if you need any further information or have questions about the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can get the product from John for $10,000, which is lower than Alice's offer. It's always better to save money, even if it means rejecting an offer."
