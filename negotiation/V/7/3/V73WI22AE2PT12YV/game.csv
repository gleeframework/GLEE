"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer on it, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500, but I'm hoping we can do a bit better than that. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is just not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $12,000. How about $11,000? This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. ",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd rather not go above $9,500. Can we try $10,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally finalize this deal.  What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent in the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll pay $10,000, but I'd like you to throw in some extras, like a free accessory or a warranty extension. Can we discuss the details?",10000.0,Bob,8,
