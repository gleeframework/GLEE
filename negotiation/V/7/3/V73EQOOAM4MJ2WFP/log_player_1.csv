"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, $975,000 is still too low for me. I believe I can get a better price if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $975,000 is simply too far off from what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product. Let's close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To make this work for me, I can offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tricky situation. While I would love to get more than $1,000,000, Bob's offer is the same as what John is offering. It's a good deal for me, considering I'm getting a guaranteed sale.  It's best to close the deal with Bob, as there's no guarantee John will still be interested in future rounds."
