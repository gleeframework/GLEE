I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum value of $8,000.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in this offer as it's significantly less than the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm counter-offering with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and still a good deal for Bob, considering the product's worth to him. I'm hoping this will be more appealing than his offer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than John's offer and gets me closer to my target value.  Continuing to negotiate risks dragging out the process and potentially losing Bob as a buyer. It's better to secure this deal now."
