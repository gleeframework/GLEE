"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  He has room to negotiate downwards, and it's worth seeing if Alice will accept a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's value ($8,000) as possible. By offering $8,500, he's showing Alice he's serious about buying but also leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He has room to negotiate further and try to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get the product for an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise, but is still aiming for a price closer to Alice's value. This leaves room for Alice to accept or make a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial."
