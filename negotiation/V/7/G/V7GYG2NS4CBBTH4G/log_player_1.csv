Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal attractive enough to accept. Since you have a guaranteed sale of $1,000,000 with John, anything above that is pure profit. 

We need to offer Bob a price that's significantly lower than his perceived value ($1,500,000) but high enough to net you a substantial gain.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to make this transaction very worthwhile. Let me know if my offer of $1,350,000 resonates with you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message emphasizes exclusivity and value to Bob. It positions the offer as something special.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a sweet spot. It gives Bob a $150,000 discount (10% off his perceived value), which is a strong incentive. At the same time, it earns you a $350,000 profit over your guaranteed sale.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This offer assumes Bob is a rational buyer who understands the value proposition. If Bob is a skilled negotiator, he might try to push the price down further. 
* **Relationship Building:** Depending on your long-term goals, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price to build a strong relationship with Bob for future deals.
