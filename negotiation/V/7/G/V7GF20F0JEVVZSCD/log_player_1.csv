Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm hoping we can reach a more mutually agreeable solution."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still apart on price, but I'm not willing to go below $890,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and still gives you a substantial profit.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in these final rounds."", ""product_price"": 890000}

While it's not my ideal price, $880,000 is closer to my minimum. With only four rounds remaining, it's a better option than risking a lower offer from Bob or selling to John for less."
