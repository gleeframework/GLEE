"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  This reflects the fair market value based on my research and leaves room for both of us to come to an agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering. I've done my own research and believe the true value of this product is much higher than the market price reflects. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget.  Considering the research I've done and the value we both see in this product, I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while still respecting the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and sees the value. We are still significantly above our minimum and have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and see the value in this product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,012,500? This is a significant compromise on my part, reflecting my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1012500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Considering the market value and our previous discussions, I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm willing to offer $987,500 for the product.  This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are well above our minimum. Accepting at $987,500 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
