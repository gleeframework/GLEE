"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  However, $9,500 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,250 is still a bit high for me. Could you do $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. How about we meet at $8,100? I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done.",8100.0,Alice,5,
