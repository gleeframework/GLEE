Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures you make more than your minimum.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $119 feels significantly cheaper than $120 to most buyers.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. He might reject it outright, hoping for a lower price. However, this strategy balances risk and reward, giving you the best chance to maximize your profit."
