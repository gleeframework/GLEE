{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,000, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* **John's price:** $12,000, which is Bob's maximum.
* **Strategy:**  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Bob can get closer to his target price before resorting to John."
