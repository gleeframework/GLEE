Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation while also demonstrating you're serious about a deal.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting at $1,200,000, you leave room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **Ensuring profit:** Even at $1,200,000, you're still earning more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Signaling your commitment:**  The message shows you're open to negotiation while also highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your target. You're in a strong position as you have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay your minimum price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting the offer, you demonstrate that you're not desperate for a sale and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Potentially secure a higher price:**  By continuing the negotiation, you can potentially push Bob closer to your desired price point. 
* **Utilize John as a bargaining chip:** The fact that you have an alternative buyer gives you more power in the negotiation. 

You can now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between your current position and his offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** You're still above Bob's offer, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to justify the price.

This counteroffer is designed to keep the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Even though you're close to your desired price, you have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay significantly more.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you:

* **Maintain your leverage:** You show Bob that you're not desperate for a deal and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Keep the possibility of a better deal open:** Continuing the negotiation could potentially lead to a higher offer from Bob.
* **Utilize John as a safety net:** Knowing you can sell to John for a much higher price gives you confidence in the negotiation.

You can now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between your current position and his offer. Remember, you have John as an alternative, so you're in a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,080,000 is still unfortunately below what I can accept for this product.

Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** You're still above Bob's offer, reminding him that you have alternatives (John).

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You've already made several concessions, and it's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to lead to a price you're comfortable with.  

You have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay your minimum price, eliminating the risk of losing out on a valuable deal.  It's time to secure the best possible outcome and sell to John."
