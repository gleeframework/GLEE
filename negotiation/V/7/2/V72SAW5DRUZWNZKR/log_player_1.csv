"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000. 
* **It's significantly below Bob's value:** Leaving room for negotiation and potential for both parties to feel they got a good deal. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It directly states the offer and leaves room for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than the $12,000 offer I made initially.  I have 8 rounds remaining, and I believe I can likely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, however. I'll lower my price to $10,500. This is still a fair price considering the value to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Mid-point:**  $10,500 is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000).
* **Reiteration of value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him strengthens my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Would you consider $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial offer of $12,000, $9,750 is a significant improvement over Bob's initial offer of $9,000. Given that we are halfway through the rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, accepting Bob's offer is a pragmatic decision. It allows me to secure a good price while still keeping the deal alive."
