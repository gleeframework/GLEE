"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Could you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Would you be willing to meet at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
