"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
