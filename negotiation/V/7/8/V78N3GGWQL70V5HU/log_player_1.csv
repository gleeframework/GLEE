{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and asking for Bob's opinion to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $95? Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is now below my minimum threshold of $100.  I'm better off selling to John for $100, ensuring I get a profit."
