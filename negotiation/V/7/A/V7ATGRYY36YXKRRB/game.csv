"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a rare and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you a bit closer to my original offer at $8,250.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,250 is a more comfortable price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise at $9,500. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
