"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This reflects its value while still offering you a considerable return on your investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
