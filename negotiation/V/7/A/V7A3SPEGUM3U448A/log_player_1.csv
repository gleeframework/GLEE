Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth without immediately hitting a wall.
* **It's closer to your minimum value:** This ensures you don't undervalue the product. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This avoids any confusion and gets the negotiation going.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can then consider his counteroffer and adjust accordingly. You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $10,000, giving you a safety net during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as he has expressed genuine interest and might be willing to go a little higher.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum value, but still allows for potential compromise. I'll try to find a price that is fair to both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? It's a good price for both of us, and ensures you get a great product within your budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
