"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product presents a valuable opportunity, however, I have a lower budget in mind. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a lower budget in mind, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my current budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I believe this price reflects the product's value while allowing me to make a worthwhile investment.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a worthwhile investment, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
