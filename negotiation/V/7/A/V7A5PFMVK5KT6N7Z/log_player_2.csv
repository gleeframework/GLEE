"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value and potential impact on your endeavors, I propose a price of $14,000 for it. This price reflects its high quality and the significant return you would receive from it. I'm confident this offer presents an excellent opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $14,000, which is still more than what it's worth to her ($12,000).  You can get the product from John for $15,000, so rejecting Alice's offer leaves you with the option to get the product at your maximum price point."
