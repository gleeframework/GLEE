Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Starting Point:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, aiming slightly higher initially maximizes potential profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate a slightly lower price, potentially still landing above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than Bob's perceived $12,000, encouraging him to accept before potential competition.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, you might need to adjust your price slightly to secure the deal."
