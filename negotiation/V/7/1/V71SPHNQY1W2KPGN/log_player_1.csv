Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, the goal is to get the highest price possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Offering it at or slightly above this might be tempting for him, but leaves money on the table.
* **Negotiating Room:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still netting Alice a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning another interested party (John) creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing Alice's profit."
