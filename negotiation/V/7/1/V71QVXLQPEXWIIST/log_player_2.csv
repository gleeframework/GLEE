"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you and allows me to make a decent profit.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering.  

He has room to negotiate, knowing the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $15,000 to him."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product.  It's still a good deal for you, as you'd be making a profit, and it's a significant saving for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $9,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  It's still a great deal for you, and it'll allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.
