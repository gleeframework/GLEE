"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd like to propose a price of $700000. This reflects my initial assessment of the product's value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.  What are your thoughts?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $825000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750000. This is a fair price given my initial assessment and allows us to move forward with the deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $800000 is still above my comfortable price point. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $775000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. It's a strong offer, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
