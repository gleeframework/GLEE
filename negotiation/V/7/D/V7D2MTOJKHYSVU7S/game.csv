"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify a price closer to $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8,000 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great compromise.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go up to $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great compromise.",8250.0,Alice,7,
