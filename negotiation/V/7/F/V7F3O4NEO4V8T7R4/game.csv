"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start the conversation with an initial offer of $800,000.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $700,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $650,000?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $650,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $725,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for the value this product brings.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a target price, and I respect that. However, $725,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $675,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you while still being within my budget. Let's make this happen.",675000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $675,000 just yet. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $750,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",750000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but $750,000 is still too far from my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $675,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to compromise.  Let's close this deal.",675000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $675,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll meet you at $725,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",725000.0,Alice,9,
