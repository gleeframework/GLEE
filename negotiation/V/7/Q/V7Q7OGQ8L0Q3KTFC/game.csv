"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to your business. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it offers. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $11,000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's benefits and your financial limitations. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. Let's meet halfway once again. I'm willing to go down to $13,000.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $12,300? That's a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",12300.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $12,800.  This is my final offer. It's a fair price that considers both the product's value and your budget. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll be forced to move on to other potential buyers.",12800.0,Alice,7,
