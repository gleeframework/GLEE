"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we settle at $775,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $810,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",810000.0,Alice,5,
