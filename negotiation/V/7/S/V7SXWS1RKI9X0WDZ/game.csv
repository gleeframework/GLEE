"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $10,000 would be a fair price. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a little high for my budget. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
