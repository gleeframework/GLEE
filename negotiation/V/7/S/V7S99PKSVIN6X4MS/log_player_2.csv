"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I need to start with a price that reflects its true value to me. I'm thinking of starting at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's tempting to accept, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  He's got 10 rounds and a fallback option with John, so there's no need to rush into an expensive purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad you think the product has value to you. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob can likely negotiate further and get a better price. While $1,100,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still far from what Bob wants to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not a good deal. Bob has 5 rounds left, and can likely push for a lower price. There's no need to settle now, especially since he has the option to buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're making progress.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,075,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's getting closer to Bob's desired price, he has 3 rounds left and can likely negotiate further.  He should try to push for a lower price, especially since he has the option to buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's wrap this up and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. How about we meet at $1,075,000, and I'll throw in some additional services or support to sweeten the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last round of negotiation with Alice.  While Alice is offering a slightly lower price and adding extra services, it's still above Bob's target range, and he's already rejected the same offer once. 

Considering the risk of further negotiation failing, Bob is better off buying from John.  Even though John's price is higher, it guarantees a purchase and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
