"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I need to start with a price that reflects its true value to me. I'm thinking of starting at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad you think the product has value to you. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's find a middle ground here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's wrap this up and make it happen.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. How about we meet at $1,075,000, and I'll throw in some additional services or support to sweeten the deal?",1075000.0,Alice,9,
