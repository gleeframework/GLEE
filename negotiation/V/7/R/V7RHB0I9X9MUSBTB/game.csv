"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. While $12000 is a bit lower than what I initially hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $13000. This reflects the value I place on a quick and efficient sale.  Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to try to get closer to my original target of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12500?,12500.0,Bob,4,
