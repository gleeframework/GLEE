Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.,9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While $9000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that?  I'm confident this product is a great value for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $9500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $8750?  It's a fair price that still allows me to save money while ensuring a mutually beneficial deal. ",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to save money, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8750. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $9200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
