"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a decent price, it's still above his desired maximum of $120.  There's room to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within a reasonable range. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is Close:**  Alice's offer of $95 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $90. 
* **Saving Money:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer saves him $5 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Alice increasing her price. 

Given the close price and the risk of a worse outcome, accepting the offer is the most strategic decision at this point."
