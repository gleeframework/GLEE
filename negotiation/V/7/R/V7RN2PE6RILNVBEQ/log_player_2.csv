"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to someone in your position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is less than your maximum budget, Alice is clearly aiming high. You know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or sticking with John as a last resort."
