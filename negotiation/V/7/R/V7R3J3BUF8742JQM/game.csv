"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still feel that $1200000 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
