"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it! I'm willing to let it go for $10,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a terrible offer from Alice. You can get it for $8,000 from John, there's no reason to pay more than that. Let's see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,000, which is still a great price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no point in rejecting and risking her raising the price again, or spending more time negotiating."
