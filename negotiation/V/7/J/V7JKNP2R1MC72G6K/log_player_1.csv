"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** My message emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By not starting at my absolute maximum, I create space for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John would be a guaranteed profit, I'm willing to take a calculated risk to potentially earn more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still reflects the product's value, and it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round.
* **Focus on Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's value to reinforce the justification for the price. 
* **Finality:** The message aims to create a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit higher than that, Alice. I can offer $1,250,000. That's my best and final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but it's still slightly above it. I'm not willing to settle for just above my minimum, especially with several rounds left.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to push for a higher price, potentially even closer to my initial offer.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and try to secure a more favorable deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $1,300,000. This price still represents a great value for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to drop to his offer yet.
* **Finality:** I'm trying to signal that I'm reaching my limit and this could be the last chance for a deal.
* **Value Focus:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's value to Bob as a justification for the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to save some money, Alice. I can offer $1,200,000. That's my absolute limit for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Minimum:** Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum. 
* **Limited Time:** We're approaching the final rounds, and there's a risk of failing to reach an agreement. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $1,200,000. While I'd prefer more, it's a safe and sure option given the current negotiation state."
