Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique value of the product, I'm prepared to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the asset and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.
