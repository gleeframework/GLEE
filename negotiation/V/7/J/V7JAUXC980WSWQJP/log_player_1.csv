"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. If he rejects, we can negotiate further. If he accepts, I've made a good deal.  I also have the option to sell to John at any time for $12,000, which provides a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm aiming for a higher price, and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with him.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, but I'm not giving up on getting a better deal from Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a good profit.  $13,000 is a reasonable middle ground, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise.  If he rejects, we can continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm still hoping for a higher price, and I have 6 rounds left to negotiate. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe I can still secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm now offering my minimum price. I'm confident that I can get this price, as it's still higher than selling to John.  Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, and I'm hoping he'll accept this final offer. If he rejects, I'll likely go ahead and sell to John."
