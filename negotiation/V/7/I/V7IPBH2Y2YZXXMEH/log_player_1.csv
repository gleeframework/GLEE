""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $2,000,000. This product is highly sought-after and I believe it will be worth significantly more in the future. Your purchase would secure you a valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both of you, starting at $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting the product's exclusivity and potential future value might encourage Bob to accept a higher price. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's personality. If he's known to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower.
* **Market Conditions:** This assumes a stable market.  If there's a reason the product's value might decrease soon, a quicker sale at a slightly lower price could be wiser."
