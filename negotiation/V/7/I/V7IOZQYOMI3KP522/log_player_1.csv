Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 2300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High (but not ridiculously so):**  Starting at $2,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""value and potential"" sets the stage for a discussion about why the product is worth more than Bob might initially think.
* **Gauge the Waters:** This first offer is as much about gauging Bob's interest and flexibility as it is about getting your ideal price immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final offer"" tactics:**  Bob using the phrase ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic. It doesn't mean you should accept immediately.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $1,800,000 is significantly less than your initial ask, it's still substantially more than your minimum acceptable price and John's offer. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's ""final offer"" allows you to test his resolve and potentially negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to be flexible. Could you consider $2,100,000?  This product has the potential to exceed your expectations, making it a smart investment at this price."", ""product_price"": 2100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Stay Firm:** Coming down from the initial offer demonstrates willingness to negotiate, but the significant drop to $2,100,000 maintains a strong position.
* **Reiterate Value:** Highlighting the product's potential return on investment justifies the higher price and aims to reframe Bob's thinking.
* **Test the Waters Again:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to reveal his true bottom line and willingness to move from his ""final offer"" position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $1,950,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,950,000 is a significant amount over your $1,500,000 minimum and John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increases, risking Bob walking away.
* **""Final Counteroffer"":**  While likely a tactic, it signals Bob is nearing his limit. 
* **Secure the Deal:** Accepting now guarantees a very profitable outcome."
