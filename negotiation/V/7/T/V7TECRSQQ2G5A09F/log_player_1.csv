{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming for a high starting price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, implying a good deal for him.
* **Confidence:** My message conveys confidence and urgency, putting pressure on Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While $1,750,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation if needed."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd need a more reasonable price. How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

* **John's Offer is a Backup:**  I have a guaranteed alternative with John, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
