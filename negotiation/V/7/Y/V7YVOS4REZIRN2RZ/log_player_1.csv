Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a little room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Above John's Offer:** This offer is significantly higher than John's $12,000, providing a safety net if Bob declines.

By starting with a strong but potentially negotiable offer, Alice maximizes her chances of securing the best possible deal."
