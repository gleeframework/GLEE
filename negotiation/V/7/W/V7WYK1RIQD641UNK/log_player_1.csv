Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,200,000 in the right hands. I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting with a higher offer of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's potential worth, making the higher price seem more reasonable.
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing John will purchase the product at her minimum desired price. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while ensuring she doesn't sell below her minimum acceptable price."
