{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you.  My starting price is $900,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it can bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand his perspective,  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident we can find a middle ground that's fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it can bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. While he's moved closer to my minimum, $775,000 isn't enough to justify selling the product. I'm confident we can find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $775,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it's still a price that allows me to get a fair return on my investment.  Let's aim to close this deal in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it can bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm disappointed that I can't reach my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $800,500 is just above my minimum. I'm accepting his offer to close the deal."
