Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60

Bob's offer:
