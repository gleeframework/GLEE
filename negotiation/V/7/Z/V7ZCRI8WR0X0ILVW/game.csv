"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $70? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",70.0,Bob,4,
