"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this will be a win-win for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  How about we settle on $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a decent profit while still allowing me to secure this product for a reasonable price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $885,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product. What do you say?",885000.0,Alice,5,
