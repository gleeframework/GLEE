{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000. Alice is offering the product at $10,000. John is also offering the product at $10,000. 

Since both options cost the same, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. It's the same as buying from John."
