"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my initial price.  How about $1,300,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to $1,250,000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
