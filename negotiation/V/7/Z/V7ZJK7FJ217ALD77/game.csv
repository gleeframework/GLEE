"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1600000. It's a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000, but I was thinking we could meet somewhere in the middle, like $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1520000. It's a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000. It's the same price I was willing to sell it to John for, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.
