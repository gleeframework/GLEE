"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13000, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, if I do say so myself!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13000. How about we meet at $11500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $12500. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12000, and I'd like to make a final offer at that price. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John.",12000.0,Bob,6,
