{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts in the middle ground, allowing for negotiation but also giving me a good profit margin. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 (John's offer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, but I'm not sure I'd go any higher.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer with a slightly higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. "", ""product_price"": 9250}
