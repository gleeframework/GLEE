"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, but I'm not sure I'd go any higher.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $9,250 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000 and significantly lower than John's price.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Fairness:**  The price is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating Alice's willingness to negotiate.

Accepting the offer is the most logical choice for Bob to get the product while saving a significant amount of money."
