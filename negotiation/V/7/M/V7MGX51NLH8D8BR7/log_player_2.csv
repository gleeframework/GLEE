"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested, Bob. I can meet you in the middle, but I need $110 to make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $110.  While it's not the $100 I was hoping for, it's a reasonable deal and better than paying John's $150 price."
