"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $1500000.  This allows me to recoup a fair amount while still offering you a competitive price.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1500000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
