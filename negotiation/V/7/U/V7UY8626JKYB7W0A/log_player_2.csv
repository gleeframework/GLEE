"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to the product's worth to Alice, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob wants to start with a low counteroffer to maximize his potential savings. 
* **Realistic Offer:** $8,500 is still higher than Bob's absolute maximum but gives Alice some room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is polite and keeps the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go any higher than $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** Bob is persistent and keeps trying to lower the price.
* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  $9,000 is a reasonable compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Emphasizing Fair Price:**  Bob frames the offer as a win-win situation for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your persistence. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, $9,500 is still above his maximum budget. Bob has already made several counteroffers and has shown his willingness to negotiate. He should continue to press for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit tight on my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $9,250.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  Bob continues to push for a lower price, but he's also showing he's willing to compromise.
* **Small Increment:** The offer is only $250 higher than Bob's previous offer, signaling that he's nearing his limit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains polite and emphasizes the possibility of a mutually beneficial deal."
