"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your persistence. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.",9500.0,Alice,5,
