"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'd like to make you a serious offer. I'm willing to part with this product for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $750000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a serious compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering it to you for $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
