Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  I believe this to be a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""fair offer,"" you subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind at a higher point.
* **Leaving Room:** While you're aiming high, the $13,500 offer isn't so outrageous that Bob will immediately walk away.  It allows him to counter-offer, opening the door for negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
