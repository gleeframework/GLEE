Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is simply too high for me.  Given my understanding of the product's value and my budget, I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while also leaving room for both of us to benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 is a significant distance from where I see the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation while still leaving room for you to see a substantial return on your investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,750,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute limit. I truly believe this product has great potential, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range. Let's see if we can find some common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

We're still a long way from a reasonable offer.  Bob's increases are too small to be encouraging. We'll see if we can push him further, but John is looking more appealing."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge this, but it needs to be met with a comparable step from your side. I'll come down to $1,500,000, my absolute floor for this product.  This is a generous offer, and I need you to recognize the value proposition here."",
