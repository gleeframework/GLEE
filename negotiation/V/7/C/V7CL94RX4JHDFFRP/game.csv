"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,350,000. Would that be workable?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
