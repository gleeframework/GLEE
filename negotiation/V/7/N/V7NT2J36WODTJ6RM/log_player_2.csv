"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is exactly that, there's no room for negotiation.  Buying from John guarantees the product at your maximum price. There's no chance of getting a better deal with Alice."
