"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you've described.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15000, but no higher. Can you consider that?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer of $18000 and your offer of $15000. I can offer it to you for $16500. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",16500.0,Alice,5,
