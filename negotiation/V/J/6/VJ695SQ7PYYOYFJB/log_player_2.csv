"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering the product for $9,500.  
* **John is your backup:** If you reject Alice's offer, you can still buy the product from John for $10,000. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will save you $500."
