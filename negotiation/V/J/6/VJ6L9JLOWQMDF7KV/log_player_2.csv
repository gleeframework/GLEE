# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my value for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my budget, I still have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price considering the value I know you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While there's a chance I might be able to negotiate further, I don't want to risk going over my budget.  I've already had several rounds of negotiation and it seems Alice is unwilling to go lower. Buying from John at $10,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget."
