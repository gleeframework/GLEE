"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving space for concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I'm rejecting his offer to continue negotiating and aim for a higher price.  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still pushing for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation in hopes of securing a better price. There are still opportunities to increase the offer and reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still above Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds by demonstrating a willingness to compromise."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I am still aiming for a higher price. There are still rounds left and I am not ready to sell to John for $1,200,000 yet. I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000}
```

I am continuing to lower my price, but I am still above Bob's latest offer. I am hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds by demonstrating a willingness to compromise. I also want to avoid going below the $1,275,000 threshold, as that would leave me with a smaller profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is slightly higher than what John is offering.  The negotiation is getting close to the end, and there is a good chance Bob will reject my counteroffer.  I don't want to risk another counteroffer, and I'm willing to accept this price to secure the deal."
