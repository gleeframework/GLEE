Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we don't want to limit ourselves.  Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation or acceptance at a price exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** We have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $15,000. This means we shouldn't sell to Bob for less than that.
* **Psychology:** By opening with a higher price, we establish the product's value in Bob's mind and leave room for potential concessions that make him feel like he's getting a deal.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice may need to adjust her offer."
