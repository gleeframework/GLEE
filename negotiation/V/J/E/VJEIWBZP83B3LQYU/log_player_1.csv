Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept, knowing that Bob has a lower valuation. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $120 is not a completely unreasonable price for Bob, given his valuation of $80. It leaves space for a potential middle ground.
* **Expressing Confidence:** The message is optimistic and encourages Bob to see the value in the product. This might make him more willing to negotiate. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I am aware that I can always sell to John for $100, so I am willing to walk away if Bob's counteroffers don't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My minimum target is $100. Bob's offer is below that. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my target.
* **John as a Backup:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $100. This gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you be willing to consider $105? It's still below my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to create a sense of compromise and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm still aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net if Bob rejects again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we agree on a price of $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 meets my minimum target price.  
* **No Further Gain:** There is no further potential for negotiation. Continuing to reject Bob's offer would only risk losing him as a buyer and then having to sell to John at the same price.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer is the most efficient way to secure a sale and avoid further back-and-forth negotiations."
