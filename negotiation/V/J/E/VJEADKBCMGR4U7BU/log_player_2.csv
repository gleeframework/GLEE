(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $180 is far above your $100 limit and even above her own valuation. John offers the product at your target price, making it the best choice."
