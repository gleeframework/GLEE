Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get closer to my desired selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to get the best price possible, selling to John at $12,000 is still a good outcome. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd like to get a higher price,  selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
