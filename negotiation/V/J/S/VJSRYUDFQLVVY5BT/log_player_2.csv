# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,575,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,590,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial asking price.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. If you're not comfortable with this offer, I'll need to consider selling the product to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,590,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,590,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,590,000 is still slightly above my budget. While we're getting close, I'm concerned that further negotiation will drag on and may not result in a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm also running out of time. To avoid further delays, I'll purchase the product from John at my target price of $1,500,000."
