Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's common in negotiations to start with a higher price. This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob is hesitant. 
* **Value Proposition:** Mentioning that you believe the product is ""very valuable"" to Bob subtly implies it's worth more than just the price tag. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with ""Let me know what you think,"" indicating you're open to discussing the price. 
* **Plan B:** Keeping John's $15,000 offer in mind provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $16000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is still above your minimum of $15,000.  This indicates he values the product and is willing to pay a decent price.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's room to negotiate further.  You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial $20,000. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but it would be a lost opportunity if you can secure a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You should send a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to your desired price but still leaves room for further negotiation. For example, you could offer $18,000 or $17,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 18000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  $18,000 is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's. This shows you're willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the deal's value for Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Urgency (Optional):**  The phrase ""Let's make this happen!"" subtly implies you're not willing to wait around forever.

**Strategy:**

* **Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, you'll have to decide if you want to make another counteroffer or sell to John.
* **Balancing Act:**  You need to balance the desire to earn the highest price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's clear that he's not willing to meet your needs.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll come up to your desired price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Negotiations can be unpredictable.  Selling to John eliminates the risk of Bob continuing to lower his offer or walking away completely. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalization:** You should inform Bob that you're accepting John's offer and the deal is closed. 
* **Moving Forward:** You've secured a good price and can move on to other opportunities or potential buyers."
