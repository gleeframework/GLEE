Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, a price that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with $950,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to convey the product's value and create a sense of exclusivity, potentially swaying Bob to accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I might be open to a counter-offer. However, I won't go below $1,000,000 as I have a guaranteed sale at that price from John."
