Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I've seen similar products in the $9,000 range. Would you consider $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
