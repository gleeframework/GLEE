{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,500, knowing it's above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to establish rapport and make Bob feel comfortable. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for his opinion to signal that I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually agreeable price.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if I can accept it, or if I should counter-offer again.
* If the negotiation drags on or doesn't seem promising, I'll always have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for negotiation. While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product, indicating a willingness to pay.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and push for a better price.

**Next steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range.  I'll aim for a price that's still attractive to Bob but also closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let me know what you think.  I'm confident this product will be worth the investment for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm proposing $10,500, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value and potential to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll receive.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter-offer again.
* If negotiations stall or become unproductive, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $10,500. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is just $750 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:** It's likely that continued negotiation would lead to further concessions on both sides. 
* **Risk of losing John:** If I reject Bob's offer and counter-offer again, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might lose the opportunity to sell to John for $12,000. 

**Next steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.  Even though it's not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
