Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
