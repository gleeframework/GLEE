Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with my ideal price, $1,000,000. I know it's more than what Bob is willing to pay right now, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and come closer to my price. I also have the safety net of John who's willing to buy for that amount, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $950,000.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still closer to my ideal price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to drop my price too much yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer and the risk of continuing negotiations is higher now. It's better to secure a sale than to risk getting nothing at all."
