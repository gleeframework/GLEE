You have three options:

You can get a better price from John, so it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

I'm offering Alice $12,500, which is still above my maximum price of $12,000 but closer to my desired outcome.  This leaves some room for negotiation while still being a strong initial counteroffer."

I'm still going to reject Alice's offer.  While $13,500 is better than her initial offer, it's still above my target price. There's still room to negotiate, and I can always walk away and buy from John if I need to."

I'm offering Alice $13,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer but still below her current offer.  I'm trying to find a compromise price that is acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200

This is a good deal for me. Alice has come down to $13,200, which is only $200 above my maximum price of $12,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will reject my counteroffer again, and I'll end up having to buy from John at my maximum price."
