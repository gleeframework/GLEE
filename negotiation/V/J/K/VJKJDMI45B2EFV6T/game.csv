"While I appreciate the offer, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can meet you halfway at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $12,500. It's a reasonable price, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $13,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",13250.0,Alice,5,
