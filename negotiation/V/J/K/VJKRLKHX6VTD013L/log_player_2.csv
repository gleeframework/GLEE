Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better than $77. How about we try $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

Alice is very slowly coming down on price.  It's unlikely further haggling will yield significantly better results. Accepting at $82 is a decent compromise."
