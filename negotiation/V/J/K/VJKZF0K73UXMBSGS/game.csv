"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150, which is a fair price for its value.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm confident you'll find it's worth that price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $130 is still outside my range.  I'm firm on $80, but I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's keep talking.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I can't go as low as $80, I'm willing to come down to $115. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price for the value you're getting.",115.0,Alice,5,
