{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I value at least $10,000.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While he's getting closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm running out of time and John is a very reliable buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm really close to taking John's offer of $10,000, but I'm willing to give you one last shot.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,250.  It's a fair compromise, and it lets us both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, could you perhaps lower the price to $8,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, the fact that he's only willing to go up to $8,900 means we're not going to find a price that works for both of us.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident he'll pay the full $10,000.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
