Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can start significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing our bottom line. This provides a reason for the high price without giving Bob too much leverage. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  While aiming high, it's important to appear flexible and willing to negotiate. This prevents alienating Bob and keeps the door open for a deal.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase the product."
