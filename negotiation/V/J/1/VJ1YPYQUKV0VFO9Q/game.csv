"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little hesitant. How about we settle at $800,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
