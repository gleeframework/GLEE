You have three options:

It's always worth seeing if you can get a better price, especially since you have a backup option with John.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

$135 is a fair compromise, and still within my budget.  I'm happy to take it."
