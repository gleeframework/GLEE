"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob values the product at, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  A $12,000 offer gives Bob enough incentive to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob, subtly emphasizing the potential benefit he'll gain from the purchase. 
* **Open-ended Question:**  The ending question invites Bob to engage and encourages a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is too low:** While it's better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to get closer to my target price. 
* **Avoiding a ""Sell to John"" decision yet:**  While selling to John is always an option, I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob.  I have 8 rounds left, which gives me plenty of time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Maintain Value:** I'm offering a compromise, but still maintaining a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I also value the product.
* **Emphasize Value Again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, reinforcing the reason for him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** I use a positive and encouraging tone to make the offer more appealing and increase the chance of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I want to see if I can push for a better deal.
* **Time is on my Side:** I have 6 rounds left, which gives me more time to negotiate. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** I believe there's still room for compromise.  Bob's message shows he's serious about the purchase, which increases my leverage in the negotiation.

I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment and willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. How about $10,000?  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and ensures we both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to find a compromise and demonstrates good faith.
* **Focusing on Fairness:** I use the phrase ""fair compromise"" to emphasize that the offer is beneficial to both parties.
* **Emphasizing Satisfaction:** I highlight the fact that both of us will be happy with the deal, increasing the chances of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, the time for negotiation is dwindling.
* **Little Room for Compromise:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed sale and avoid the potential for a loss."
