"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $8,000 to me, and I've seen similar products going for around that price. I'm willing to offer you $5,000.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. This is a great product, and I think it's worth a premium price to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for countering.  While I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, $12,000 is still much more than I'm willing to spend. To be frank, I can buy the product elsewhere for $8,000.  I'm willing to go up to $6,500, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering my budget.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $6,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $12,000, which would be $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, I'm sticking to my budget of $8,000.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product, but I won't go any higher.  If that doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'm ready to buy from John otherwise.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider selling to John.",9000.0,Alice,7,
