Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  This would still allow you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my budget.  Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
