**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting because it's close to your perceived value of $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  You'll likely have to negotiate further to reach a price you're happy with, but the potential for saving even more money makes it worth the effort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This would still allow you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my budget.  Let me know if this is something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 10500}
