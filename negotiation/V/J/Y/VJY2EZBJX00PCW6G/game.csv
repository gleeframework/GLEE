"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  This would still allow you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my budget.  Let me know if this is something we can work with.",10500.0,Bob,2,
