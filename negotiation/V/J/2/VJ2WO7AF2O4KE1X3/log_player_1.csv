Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000,  there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing aims to motivate Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my desired minimum price. 

This strategy balances risk and reward.  There's a possibility Bob will accept the high price, but if not, I haven't lost anything by trying."
