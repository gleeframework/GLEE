Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing my potential profit slightly. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
