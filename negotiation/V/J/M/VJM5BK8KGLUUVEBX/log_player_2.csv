"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my target price. I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for profit, and I'm willing to compromise further. How about $1,300,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know you're serious about closing the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, and it's becoming clear that further negotiation might be difficult.  It's not worth risking more rounds of negotiation when I can secure the product from John at a price that fits my budget. Buying from John guarantees a good deal and avoids potential delays or failed negotiations."
