"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $800,000. Would you be willing to consider this lower price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. However, I must respectfully decline your latest offer of $1,000,000. I am still unable to meet that price. I would like to propose $900,000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
