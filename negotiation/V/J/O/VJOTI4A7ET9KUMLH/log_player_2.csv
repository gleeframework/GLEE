"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

You can get the product for $100 from John, which is significantly cheaper than Alice's $145 offer.  There's no need to negotiate further since you already have a better deal lined up."
