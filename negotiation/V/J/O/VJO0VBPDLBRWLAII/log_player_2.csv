"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You can likely get a better price. 
* **There's no rush.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and buying from John is always an option if you can't get a better deal from Alice. 

By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $50,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is significant, showing your intent to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** You still value the product, leaving space for Alice to counter without feeling overly pressured.

This counteroffer allows you to test the waters while maintaining a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:** It's a $25,000 compromise from her previous offer, demonstrating her willingness to negotiate.
* **You're saving money:**  $725,000 is a good price, especially considering you have limited rounds left and buying from John would cost you more.

This is a good opportunity to close the deal and secure a decent saving."
