"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,275,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me, while also taking into account your willingness to negotiate.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
