"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its unique qualities and potential, I believe a fair price would be $1,150,000. This allows for a significant return on your investment while ensuring I receive a fair value for my asset. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also allows for a more reasonable return on investment for me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a reasonable price, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This gives us both a good deal, allowing you a substantial return on your investment and ensuring I receive a fair price for my asset.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my investment goals.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and I understand your perspective. However, $1,050,000 is still slightly below what I believe the product is worth to you. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it provides you with a substantial return on your investment.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to reach a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,075,000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,062,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
