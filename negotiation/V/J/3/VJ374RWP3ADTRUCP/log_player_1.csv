Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a premium. Starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A price of $19,000 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying comfortably above your minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps you understand how motivated Bob is to buy. If he flat-out rejects this price, you can adjust your strategy knowing you have John as a backup. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
