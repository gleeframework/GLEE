"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I've done some research and I believe it's a bit overpriced at $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $10000, which I think is a fair price considering the market value.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the market value. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've done some more research and I believe I can find a similar product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $9500. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the product's features. I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $11000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you and the market value. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I think $9000 is a fair price for the product, considering its market value and the value it will bring to my business. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. I'd like to hear your thoughts.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to walk away, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $10500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you and the market value. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",10500.0,Alice,7,
