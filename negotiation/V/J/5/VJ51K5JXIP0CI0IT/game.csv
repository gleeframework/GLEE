"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the substantial benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  I believe this price reflects the fair market value, considering the product's potential and the fact that I have other purchase options. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective. I understand your position, but the $850,000 price doesn't reflect the true value and potential this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while still making it a worthwhile investment for you.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. As I mentioned earlier, I'm willing to pay a maximum of $850,000 for this product. I believe this price reflects its true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,
