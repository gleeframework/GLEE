"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the substantial benefits it offers. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he has a backup option of buying from John for $800,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  I believe this price reflects the fair market value, considering the product's potential and the fact that I have other purchase options. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective. I understand your position, but the $850,000 price doesn't reflect the true value and potential this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while still making it a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $975,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his budget. He is willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for the product.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
