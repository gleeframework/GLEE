"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $50 is a good price, it's always worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better deal without risking missing out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $40 offer shows I'm serious about buying but also want a good deal.  If she rejects this, I can adjust my offers in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, and $45 is a reasonable price within my budget. There's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to a higher price or even a deal breakdown. It's better to secure the product at a decent price rather than risk missing out on a good deal."
