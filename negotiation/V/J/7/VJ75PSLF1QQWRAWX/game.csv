"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a little lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? This is a great deal for both of us.",112.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $108 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $110. I'm feeling generous, and this is a really good price for a product worth $120 to you.",110.0,Alice,5,
