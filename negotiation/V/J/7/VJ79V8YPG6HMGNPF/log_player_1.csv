I'm lowering my price slightly to try and meet Bob halfway. We're getting closer to an agreement and I want to avoid reaching the point where selling to John becomes the more appealing option."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:

At this point, we are running out of rounds and Bob is not willing to budge much further.  While I'd like to get a higher price, I'm risking ending up with less than my minimum if I keep negotiating with Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit and eliminates the risk of getting stuck with a lower price."
