Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate.  This is a good strategy to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. 

Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $8,000 at any point, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or John.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7800 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $7,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I don't want to risk going back and forth with Bob and potentially ending up with a worse outcome.  I'm going to sell to John, as it's a guaranteed $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
