"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset worth $15,000 at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counteroffer process and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000 for this product. I believe this price is still fair given its value to me and your desired sale price.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a price of $11,000? This would be a fair compromise between the value you see in the product and my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's price of $15,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer at $11,000 secures the product at a favorable price."
