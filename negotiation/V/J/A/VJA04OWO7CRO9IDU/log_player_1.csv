"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, and it establishes a strong starting point. It's important to be bold in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent price, I'm holding out for a higher price.  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and gets me closer to John's offer of $800,000. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair price and is willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price. I'm concerned that we're getting further away from a deal, and we only have 4 rounds left. To avoid risking a lower price, I'm going to sell to John for $800,000. This ensures I get a decent price and don't have to risk losing more money in the negotiation."
