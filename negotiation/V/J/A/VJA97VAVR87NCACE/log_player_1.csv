Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $1,100,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation and potentially a win-win scenario for both of us.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he gets. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my fallback price of $1,200,000 from John.
* **Increase the chances of Bob accepting:** By highlighting the value he receives, I am making the offer more appealing.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob is hesitant, I can potentially lower the price slightly to secure a deal."
