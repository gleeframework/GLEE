{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm confident I can get more than my minimum price of $150."

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer $175, $160 is still above my minimum and a good deal. I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
