"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price. He can always choose to buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his counteroffer with a significant drop to $950,000. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a price closer to his maximum.  The $950,000 offer is still above John's price, which provides a safety net if the negotiation fails. This counteroffer is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly from the first round.  $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than what Bob could get from John. It's a good deal for Bob, especially considering he might not be able to get a better price in the next round.  It's better to secure the product now at a slightly higher price than risk losing it in further negotiations."
