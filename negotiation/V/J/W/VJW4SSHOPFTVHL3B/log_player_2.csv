"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $15,000 from John, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer at $12,000. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $10,000.  Offering $9,000 is a significant discount and still leaves room for a potential compromise.  It's a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is lower than John's price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds left to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $11,500. You're aiming for a price closer to her value of $10,000. By offering $10,500, you're showing a willingness to compromise while still getting a good deal. It also allows for some potential negotiation room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You're trying to get as close to $10,000 as possible. While John's price is higher, you still have 5 rounds to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still higher than what you're aiming for. You're trying to get as close to $10,000 as possible.  By offering $11,000, you're showing a willingness to compromise and get closer to Alice's potential price. You are demonstrating that you are taking her offers seriously, and are willing to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,800 is still higher than what you are aiming for, but it's getting closer to your desired price point. You have only 3 rounds left, and the risk of going back and forth and then ending up buying from John for $15,000 is too high.  It's in your best interest to accept this offer and save some money compared to buying from John."
