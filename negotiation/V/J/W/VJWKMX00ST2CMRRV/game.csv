"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my range. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $12000 at this time. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate closer to that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I can only go up to $15000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $17000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $16000. This is a good compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you say?",16000.0,Bob,6,
