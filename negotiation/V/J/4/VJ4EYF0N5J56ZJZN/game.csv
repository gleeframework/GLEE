"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I believe the product is a bit overpriced at $90. How about we meet in the middle at $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $75, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $60 is low, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $67?",67.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $67 is still a little low for me. Let's compromise at $70. That's still a good price for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this deal happen.",70.0,Alice,5,
