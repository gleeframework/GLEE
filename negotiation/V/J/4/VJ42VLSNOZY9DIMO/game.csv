"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, it's still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $9,000.  How about $8,900? I'm trying to stay within a tight budget.",8900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,900 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference: $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
