{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial offer:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($150). This is to encourage Bob to accept the offer and avoid the potential hassle of counteroffers.
* **Reasoning:** I believe this price is high enough to still give me a profit, while also being attractive to Bob. He could potentially find the product for a lower price elsewhere, but I'm hoping to highlight the value and convince him that this is a good deal. 
* **Alternative option:** By stating my minimum price and keeping John as a backup buyer, I create a safety net. If Bob keeps rejecting offers, I can confidently end the negotiation and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would be a substantial loss for me. 
* I will proceed with a counteroffer to try and find a middle ground, but I will keep John as a backup option in case the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $80 is quite a bit below what I can realistically accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($80). 
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob, highlighting that $115 is still a great deal for him.
* **Maintaining my position:** I'm not drastically lowering my price yet, as I'm still aiming for a profit above my minimum of $150. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using a friendly tone and keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  
* Although he's shown willingness to compromise, the offer is still too low for me to accept at this point. 
* **I will proceed with a counteroffer to try and find a middle ground.** I will keep John as a backup option in case the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm open to a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without taking a significant loss.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($95). 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Framing:**  I'm framing the $105 price as a ""fair price for both of us"" to emphasize the compromise. 
* **Maintaining my position:** I'm not drastically lowering my price yet, as I'm still aiming for a profit above my minimum of $150. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using a friendly tone and keeping the door open for further negotiation."
