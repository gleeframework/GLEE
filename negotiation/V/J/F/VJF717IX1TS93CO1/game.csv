"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $80 is quite a bit below what I can realistically accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm open to a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without taking a significant loss.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
