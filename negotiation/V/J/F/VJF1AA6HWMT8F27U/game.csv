"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your asking price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal today.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer, as I know I can find other interested buyers at this price.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
