"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $1,000,000. This is far too high. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your asking price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer, as I know I can find other interested buyers at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
