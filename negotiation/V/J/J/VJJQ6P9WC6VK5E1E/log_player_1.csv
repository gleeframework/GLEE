Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000, a price that reflects its potential for substantial returns."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting near your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation but sets a strong anchor. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" you aim to shift Bob's focus away from his perceived value ($800,000).
* **Strategic Cushion:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale to John ($1,500,000) provides a safety net while still aiming high.

**Important Considerations:**

* This initial offer is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.
* Gauge Bob's reactions and adjust your strategy accordingly. If he seems completely turned off by the high price, you might need to significantly lower it during negotiations."
