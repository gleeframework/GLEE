Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is higher than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $100 is below Bob's maximum of $120, so there's potential for both of you to get a better deal. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob the chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $90?  I'm willing to pay that much and I think it's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal for you. It's above your minimum of $80, and it's likely that you won't get a better offer from Bob in subsequent rounds. It's also faster to close the deal now than to continue negotiating, which could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely."
