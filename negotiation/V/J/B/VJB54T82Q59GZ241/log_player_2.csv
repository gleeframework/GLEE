"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with John's offer if necessary."
