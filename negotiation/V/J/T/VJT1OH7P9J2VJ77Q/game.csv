"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140, which would be $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
