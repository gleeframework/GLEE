Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $15,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $12,000, giving me some profit.  I chose this price because it might be high enough to entice Bob to buy, while also providing a significant margin if he does. However, I'm aware that there's a risk of him rejecting the offer. If that happens, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, which still ensures I don't lose money."
