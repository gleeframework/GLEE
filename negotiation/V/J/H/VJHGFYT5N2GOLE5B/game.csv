"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering your product's value to you, and it gives me some room to make a profit.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it gives you some room to make a profit. Let's try to find a middle ground. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering your product's value to you and the fact that I can get it from John for the same price.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any longer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
