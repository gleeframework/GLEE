Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is closer to my desired value than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to see the value in the product and to potentially close the deal quickly. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $1,100,000 is still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, while leaving room for me to potentially make concessions if needed. 
* **Backstop:**  I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob break down. This gives me a safety net and bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true worth while also allowing me to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,200,000. Accepting it would leave me with a substantial loss.
* **Room for counteroffers:** While $1,050,000 is below my minimum, it's closer to my starting point than Bob's initial perceived value of $1,000,000. This means there's room for negotiation and a possible counteroffer that could be more agreeable to both parties.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, which is my desired price point. This gives me leverage and makes me less likely to settle for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm sure you'll agree that this offer is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** My counteroffer of $1,080,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my desired minimum. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce its worth and justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive framing:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""good deal for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see the benefits of accepting. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** This counteroffer gives me room to potentially make a final concession if necessary, while still remaining closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to increase my offer to $1,070,000. This still allows me to save some money, while acknowledging the value of your product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below desired value:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,200,000.  Accepting it would still result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for improvement:** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. This means there's potential for further negotiation and a possible counteroffer that could be more agreeable to both parties.
* **John's offer remains the safety net:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is still a viable option, giving me leverage in negotiations and making me less likely to settle for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,070,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,085,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the agreement."", ""product_price"": 1085000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my goal:**  $1,085,000 is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, bringing us closer to my desired price point. 
* **Compromise and fairness:**  I'm proposing a ""meet in the middle"" approach, emphasizing fairness and highlighting that it's a compromise for both of us.
* **Staying firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not significantly lowering my price further. This shows I'm committed to getting a fair deal while leaving room for one final counteroffer. 
* **Emphasize win-win:**  I focus on the idea of both of us ""feeling good"" about the agreement to encourage a positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,072,500. I believe this price reflects the value of your product while allowing me to save some money. I hope this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,072,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,072,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,072,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** At this point, further negotiation with Bob would likely result in a very small increase in his offer, making it unlikely that I would reach my desired price.
* **John's offer is a better alternative:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my desired price, while continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a lower price and a longer negotiation process. 

Given the limited potential for improvement in Bob's offer and the certainty of a favorable deal with John, it's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John."
