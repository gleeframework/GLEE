"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $600,000.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $600,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $650,000.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $650,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $675,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way up to $675,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $650,000 and $675,000, which would be $662,500. This is the best I can do at this point.",662500.0,Alice,5,
