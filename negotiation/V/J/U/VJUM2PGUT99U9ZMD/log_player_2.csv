"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price. 
* You can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still slightly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* You are still within the first few rounds of negotiation and have room to try and bring the price down further.
* While buying from John is a guaranteed option, you have a chance to potentially save some money by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is my maximum budget and a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,015,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* We are in round 5, and there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.
* It's becoming risky to keep negotiating as the risk of not closing a deal and losing out on the product increases with each round. 
* Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees I get the product at my budget limit."
