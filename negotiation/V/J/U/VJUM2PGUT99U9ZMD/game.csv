"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is my maximum budget and a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
