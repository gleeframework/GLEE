"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  While $12,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, but $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
