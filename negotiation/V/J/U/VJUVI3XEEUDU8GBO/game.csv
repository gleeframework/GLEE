"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget while still reflecting the product's true value.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit too high for my budget. How about $1,300,000? That's a fair compromise that leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
