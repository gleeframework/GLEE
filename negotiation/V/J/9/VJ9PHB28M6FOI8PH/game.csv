"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a compromise here. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
