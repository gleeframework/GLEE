"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is simply not enough for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the product's true value and gives you a fair price. Let's find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1400000 is closer, but we're still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's the last one I'm willing to make.  Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
