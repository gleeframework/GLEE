"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Opening with a high price ($2,000,000) sets the bar and gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to value:** Highlighting the uniqueness and worth of the product encourages Bob to consider the value proposition.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message conveys openness to negotiation, making Bob feel comfortable to counteroffer. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $1,500,000 allows me to be bold in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob.  There's a good chance we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While John's offer is attractive,  I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the product's true value and gives you a fair price. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I've lowered my price by $250,000, showing willingness to negotiate but still remaining above my minimum.
* **Highlight value:**  Emphasizing the ""true value"" of the product reinforces my initial argument and justifies my price point.
* **Focus on finding common ground:** This language encourages Bob to meet me halfway and suggests a positive, collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below minimum:** $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I still have 6 rounds left. We are getting closer to a potential agreement, and I believe I can push Bob a bit higher.
* **John's offer is a safe fallback:**  While John's offer is tempting,  I'm optimistic that I can secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,400,000 is closer, but we're still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's the last one I'm willing to make.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:**  I'm lowering my price again, but only by $150,000 this time. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a price higher than John's offer.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing that this is my ""last"" offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's close this deal"" encourages Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable price and even lower than John's offer.
* **Time is running out:**  We're in round 6, with only 4 rounds left.  There's not enough time to negotiate further.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.

It's better to secure the guaranteed profit from John than to risk further rounds of negotiation with Bob, who is unwilling to meet my minimum price."
