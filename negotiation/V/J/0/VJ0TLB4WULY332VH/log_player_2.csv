Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $725,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?

$715,000 is a good price considering the product's value to Alice and the fact that John is selling it for $1,000,000. There's no guarantee that I can get a lower price with further negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal."
