"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $725,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $725,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend right now. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both recognize in this product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
