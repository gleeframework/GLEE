"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose all the details right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.
