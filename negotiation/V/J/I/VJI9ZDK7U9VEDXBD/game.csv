"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $12000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think $10000 is still a bit low considering the product's value to me is $15000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11250. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested!",11250.0,Alice,5,
