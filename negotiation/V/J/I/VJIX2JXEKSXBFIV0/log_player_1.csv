{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I think we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, recognizing that Bob values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's the highest I can go without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have preferred a higher price, it's not worth risking losing the deal with Bob.  I will accept his offer."
