"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for someone like you, Bob. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum limit of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price that works for him. There are still rounds left, and he might be able to convince Alice to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer on the lower end of the spectrum. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there are still rounds left, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.  In this scenario, it's more beneficial for Bob to take the safe option and buy from John for $1,000,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
