Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $8,750 is closer to my minimum of $8,000, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to him.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000."
