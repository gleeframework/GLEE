Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at the highest possible point, maximizing my potential profit. I'm hoping that Bob, despite the value gap, might be interested in negotiating from this point. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue the negotiation or sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's significantly less than my minimum desired price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a good deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This counteroffer represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $95.  If you're not willing to come down further, I'll have to take my business elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.  Bob has clearly indicated that he's not willing to go higher.  It's best to secure the guaranteed $150 from John and avoid further negotiations that might result in a lower price."
