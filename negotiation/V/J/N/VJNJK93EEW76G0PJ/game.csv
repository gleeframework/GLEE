"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. This represents a significant value for you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,500,000 to you. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $1,200,000 for the product?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's try a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This would still represent a significant value for you, and allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
