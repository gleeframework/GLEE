Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. Can you consider it?

You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  My minimum is $16,000.  I think this is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's a bit closer to my minimum, it's still below $15,000, which is my floor.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than I believe the product is worth."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm still a bit short of my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,800. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,800

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $15,000.  I've already made several concessions and I'm not sure he's willing to meet me in the middle. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
