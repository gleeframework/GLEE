"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000, as I have no information about Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives us room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and encouraging, focusing on the product's value and potential. 
* **Focus on Fair Price:** I'm trying to frame the offer as fair to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept Bob's first offer right away. I need to see if I can push for a higher price. 

* **Rejecting the Offer:** This allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round.
* **Exploring Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's room for negotiation, given Bob's initial interest and my starting point of $1,800,000. 
* **Avoiding a Quick Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer too quickly might not be the best strategy in this scenario."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer,  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's initial counter.
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my position, highlighting the product's true value and offering a compromise.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm staying positive and trying to build a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing how a deal at $1,500,000 is beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1000000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than my target. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as there's a chance I can secure a better deal.

* **Rejecting the Offer:** I'm holding firm and rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to push for a higher price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown interest in the product and has already increased his offer.
* **Avoiding a Suboptimal Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significantly lower profit than my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be reasonable.  $1,000,000 is still quite a bit lower than what the product is worth. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your needs and the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering $1,300,000, a slight decrease from my previous offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal while emphasizing the product's value.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise to encourage acceptance.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone.

**Strategy:**

By dropping slightly and highlighting the compromise aspect, I'm aiming to push Bob towards accepting an offer closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to find a price that works for me. I'm willing to go down to $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While there are still rounds left, I'm concerned that further negotiations may not lead to a satisfactory result. 

* **Selling to John:**  This is a safe and secure option, guaranteeing me my minimum desired price.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing with Bob might lead to further price reductions, potentially pushing me below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds remaining, I want to ensure I can secure a reasonable price before the opportunity to sell to John expires."
