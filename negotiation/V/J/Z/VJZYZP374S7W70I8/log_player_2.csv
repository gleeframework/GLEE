Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can get closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $11,000 is still a bit below my target. How about we compromise at $11,250? It's a fair price that should make us both happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, you can still try to squeeze out a bit more.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get down to your preferred price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,100. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 11100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept it. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,200? It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you've only got 3 rounds left. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $10,000.  You've saved money and avoided further negotiation."
