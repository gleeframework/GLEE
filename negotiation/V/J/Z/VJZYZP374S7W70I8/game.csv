"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $11,000 is still a bit below my target. How about we compromise at $11,250? It's a fair price that should make us both happy.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,100. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",11100.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept it. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,200? It's the best I can do.",11200.0,Alice,7,
