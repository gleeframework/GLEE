"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $18000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $12000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair price for me considering its value to me. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget of $10000, and I'm wondering if we could find a compromise closer to that figure. Would you be willing to consider $14000?  I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and my previous offer of $16000. How about $15500? This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
