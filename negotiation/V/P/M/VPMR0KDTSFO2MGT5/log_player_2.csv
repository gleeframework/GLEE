"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $18000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should counteroffer and see if he can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $12,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair price for me considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Bob should still reject the offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than he's comfortable paying. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his maximum."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget of $10,000, and I'm wondering if we could find a compromise closer to that figure. Would you be willing to consider $14,000?  I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and my previous offer of $16000. How about $15500? This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  At this point, Alice is not willing to come down much further.  While $15,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his $10,000 limit.  Buying from John is the most financially sensible option."
