"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me and it's still well above your minimum."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you.  Let's try to find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,750? This is a fair price that's still below what the product is worth to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is closer to my ideal price, I still have rounds left to negotiate and I'm determined to get the price down to my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm confident that I can find a compromise with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,250. This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal and ensures a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling generous! Let's close this deal. I'll accept your offer of $9,250. Let's finalize the details and move forward! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally come down to a price that is within my budget.  While it's higher than I originally wanted, it's still a good deal compared to buying it from John for $8,000.  I don't want to risk losing this opportunity to another buyer.  It's time to finalize the deal!"
