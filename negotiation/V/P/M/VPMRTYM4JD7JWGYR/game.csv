"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me and it's still well above your minimum.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you.  Let's try to find common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to close the deal here.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,750? This is a fair price that's still below what the product is worth to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away!",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,250. This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal and ensures a win-win for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,6,
