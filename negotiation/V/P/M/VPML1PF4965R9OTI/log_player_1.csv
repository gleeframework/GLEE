Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the higher price.  
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of desirability and urgency.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer. Your offer needs to be compelling enough to make him pay more than his perceived value.
* **Negotiation:**  This offer is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have room to go down to $1,200,001 and still make a profit over John's offer."
