Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives Bob some room to bargain and increases the chances of reaching an agreement. If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider lowering my price or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's not worth accepting his offer. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
