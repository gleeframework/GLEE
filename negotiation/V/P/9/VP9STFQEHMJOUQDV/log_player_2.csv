"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is closer to her value than to mine. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've started with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This tactic:

* **Tests Alice's flexibility:** It helps gauge how much she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** Even if she rejects this offer, there's space to meet in the middle. 
* **Keeps the $10,000 alternative in mind:** My offer is significantly below my maximum budget, reminding Alice that I have another option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my reservation price of $10,000. There's no point in rejecting this offer and risking losing the deal, as I can't get a better price from John."
