"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can justify the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but only to $1,700,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let's finalize the deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be at $1,250,000. This is my last serious offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
