"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to keep within budget, but $12,000 is a significant drop.  This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will more than pay for itself.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?",12750.0,Alice,3,
