"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum value, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'll see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.  Selling to John right now would be a safe option, but I'd rather see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still aiming for a profit. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to counter-offer one more time before seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to accept my minimum value, but if Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses.  Bob's offer is below my minimum value and there's no guarantee he'll come up.  I'm selling to John for $12,000 to secure a reasonable profit."
