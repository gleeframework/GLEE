"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,150? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $10,975. Can you consider that price?",10975.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $10,975 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's try $11,062.50. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",11062.5,Alice,5,
