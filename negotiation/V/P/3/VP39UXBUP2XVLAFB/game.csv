"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target price of $15000 as possible. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to get close to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $11000.
