"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $80.  Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  Could you meet me halfway at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen - how about $110? That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't go higher than $100. This is really my limit, and I'd be happy to buy it right now at this price. ",100.0,Bob,6,
