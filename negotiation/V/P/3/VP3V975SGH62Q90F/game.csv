"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
