# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This price still allows you to make a profit, and it's closer to the value we both recognize in this product.
