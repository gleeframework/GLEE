"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I believe it's a win-win situation.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This would still be a profitable deal for you, and I'm sure we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This price still allows you to make a profit, and it's closer to the value we both recognize in this product.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
