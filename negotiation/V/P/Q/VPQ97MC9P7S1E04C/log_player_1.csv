Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $850,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That being said, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below the product's value to both you and Bob. There's room for negotiation, and it's unlikely Bob will walk away from a deal this close to his valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $725,000 is too low for what this product offers. How about $780,000?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 780000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Signals firmness:** By stating it's your final offer, you create urgency and show you're serious about your price floor.
* **Stays above Bob's offer:** This avoids anchoring the negotiation too close to his number while still showing movement.
* **Leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a 'win':**  If he accepts, he's still getting a discount from your original ask.

This is a balance between pushing for more and risking Bob walking away to accept your guaranteed $800,000 from John."
