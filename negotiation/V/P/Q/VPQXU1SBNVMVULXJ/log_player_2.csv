"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

You can get the product for cheaper from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it for $80? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good price, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $90 is still higher than what John is selling it for. It's better to buy from John and save $10."
