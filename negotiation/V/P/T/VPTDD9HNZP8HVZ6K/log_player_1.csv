Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  While Bob's value is $80, you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John. Therefore, you start higher than Bob's valuation to see if you can exceed it.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  A high starting price allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to lower the price slightly and still remain above your minimum.
* **Don't be greedy:**  While you want to maximize profit, an outrageously high price will likely lead to an immediate rejection from Bob. $170 is a significant markup but not so high that it seems unreasonable. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's no guarantee Bob will accept the offer, even if it's slightly above his valuation."
