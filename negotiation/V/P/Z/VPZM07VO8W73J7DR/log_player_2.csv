"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Current situation:** Alice's offer is $9,500, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Buying from John:**  While John offers a higher price ($10,000), it's still within Bob's budget. However, it's not the best deal.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering:** Bob has room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a lower price and potentially save money.

**Next steps:**

* Bob should counteroffer with a price closer to his maximum budget (e.g., $9,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500.
* **Counteroffer:** $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant discount from Alice's offer and still within Bob's budget.  It also shows Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously.

**Next steps:**

* Wait for Alice's response to the counteroffer.  
* If Alice rejects, Bob can adjust his counteroffer further down, but should keep it within his maximum budget of $10,000. 
* If Alice accepts, Bob has secured a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,250. This is still above Bob's ideal price but closer to his budget.
* **Buying from John:**  John's price is $10,000, making Alice's offer slightly better. However, there's still room to negotiate with Alice.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering:**  Bob has room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows him to propose a lower price and potentially secure a better deal.

**Next steps:**

* Bob should counteroffer with a price closer to his ideal price (e.g., $9,000 or even slightly lower) to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,250.
* **Counteroffer:** $9,000. This is a reasonable compromise, closer to Alice's last offer but still within Bob's budget. 

**Next steps:**

* Wait for Alice's response. If she rejects, Bob can consider lowering his offer slightly, but should be mindful of his maximum budget of $10,000.
* If Alice accepts, Bob has successfully negotiated a good price."
