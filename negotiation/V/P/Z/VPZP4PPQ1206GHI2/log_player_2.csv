"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value may vary. Let's start with a fair offer. How about $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you understanding the value might vary.  I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you consider $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, focusing on my budget rather than the product's value.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends with a question, keeping the conversation open and inviting Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has come down from her initial price, and $140 is within my budget.
* **Fairness:**  Alice's message emphasizes a fair compromise, which makes it easier to accept.
* **Limited Rounds:**  While I could try to negotiate further, it's better to avoid the risk of reaching the end of the rounds without a deal."
