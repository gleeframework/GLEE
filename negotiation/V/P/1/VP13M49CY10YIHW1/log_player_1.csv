{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to go back and forth a bit if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm willing to try for a bit more.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
