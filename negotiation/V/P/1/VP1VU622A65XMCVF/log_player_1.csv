"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room for negotiation and allows me to potentially maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still hoping to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to $82.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Bob halfway. I believe this price is still fair, while also giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting closer, but I've already gone through several rounds and I'm starting to run out of time.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's safer than risking getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
