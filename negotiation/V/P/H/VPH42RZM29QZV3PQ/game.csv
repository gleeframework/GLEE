"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $9,000 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $7,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I could potentially do $6,800. That's a fair offer considering its value to me.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $6,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,200.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this a good deal.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,000? That's my final offer.",7000.0,Bob,6,
