"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $9,000 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This tactic:

* **Establishes our position:**  We're serious about buying but looking for a substantial discount.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it opens the door for her to counter with a more reasonable price. 

We are aiming for a price close to our $8,000 maximum, but we need to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $7,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, $7,500 is still closer to her desired price than ours. We can push for a better deal. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I could potentially do $6,800. That's a fair offer considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 6800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  We're moving closer to Alice's price, demonstrating our genuine interest.
* **Strategic increase:**  The jump from $6,000 to $6,800 is significant but still keeps us comfortably below our $8,000 limit.
* **Subtle anchoring:** By mentioning ""fair offer considering its value to me,"" we remind Alice that our budget is a factor. 

We're getting closer to a potential deal! Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $6,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,200.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close! Alice is definitely willing to negotiate, but $7,200 is still slightly above our ideal price.  We're only $300 away from John's price, so the potential savings are shrinking. We'll try one more time to get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows we're willing to compromise to reach a deal.
* **Firm but polite:** By stating it's our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're serious. However, we maintain a polite and appreciative tone. 

This offer is a good balance between trying to get the best possible price and avoiding the risk of Alice walking away. If she rejects this, we'll likely buy from John."
