,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this moment. I'm happy to offer $75 for it, given my budget.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $82.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value I think the product holds.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $82.50 is closer, I'm still a bit over my target. How about $78.75? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",78.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $82.00. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you $81.50. This is the best I can do without compromising the value of the product.",81.5,Alice,5,
