"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make a deal that benefits both of us. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer and I look forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
