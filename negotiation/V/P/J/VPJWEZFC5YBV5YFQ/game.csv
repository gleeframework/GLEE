"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up this opportunity. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $990000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value. Can you meet me at this price?",990000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $990000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1020000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've been considering buying the product from John for $1000000, and I'm not sure I can justify spending $1020000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1005000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",1005000.0,Bob,6,
