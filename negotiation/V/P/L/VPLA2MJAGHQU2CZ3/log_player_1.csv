"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for room to compromise.  I'm not sure of Bob's value for the product, so this is a good starting point to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired target. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer still represents a good profit for me while staying within a reasonable range that might entice Bob."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial target.  While $1,700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better deal. With several rounds left, I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm narrowing the gap further, but still maintaining a price point above my minimum. This counteroffer signals my flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately. It's a strategic move to see if Bob will meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,600,000 is just above my minimum, I still see room for negotiation.  I believe Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, and with only four rounds left, I want to maximize my potential earnings. I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a significant concession this round, bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates my willingness to reach an agreement, but it's still above my absolute minimum.  With only three rounds left, I need to show that I'm serious about a deal, but also ensure that I'm not selling the product for significantly less than I believe it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum. I'm willing to accept this price as it's a decent profit and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a higher agreement in the remaining time. Selling to John would only net me $1,500,000, so this deal is slightly better."
