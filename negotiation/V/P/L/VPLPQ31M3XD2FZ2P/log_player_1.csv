"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest while still aiming for a price close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $100. How about we try $92? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $92 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle at $98? That seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $98, which would be $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$95 is still below my minimum desired price, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round to see if I can close the deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $97.  I'm confident this product will be well worth the investment for you."", ""product_price"": 97}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $97 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $97, which would be $96. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time and Bob is proving to be difficult to negotiate with.  Even though $96 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
