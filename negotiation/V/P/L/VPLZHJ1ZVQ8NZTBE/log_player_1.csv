Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $15,000.  How about we split the difference and I'll let you have it for $16,000? It's still a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to propose $15,500 as the price for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is close to my minimum and I'm confident I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  It's better to accept and secure the sale than risk losing it entirely."
