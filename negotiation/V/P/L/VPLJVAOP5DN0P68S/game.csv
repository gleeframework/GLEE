"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm confident you'll find this product is worth the investment.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $7,500. How about we try $7,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset.",8000.0,Alice,5,
