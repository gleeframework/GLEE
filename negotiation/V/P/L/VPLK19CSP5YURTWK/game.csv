"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to get closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Would you be open to considering that?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $11,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're not willing to go to $11,000.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500, but I'd rather meet you at $10,500 than $10,750. Can we meet in the middle at $10,625?",10625.0,Bob,6,
