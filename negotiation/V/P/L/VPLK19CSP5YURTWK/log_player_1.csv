{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I want to try and get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible, but I also want to be open to negotiation. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I have John's offer as a fallback, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation. There's still room for compromise.
* **John's offer as leverage:** I have John's offer as a safety net, which allows me to hold out for a better price from Bob. 

I'm going to counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value or at least closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to get closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Would you be open to considering that?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm aiming for a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial proposal. 
* **Staying firm on value:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drop below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Encouraging negotiation:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, suggesting that I'm open to finding a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $11,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, it's still significantly below it. 
* **Opportunity for a higher price:** I believe there's still potential for a better offer from Bob. He's clearly interested in the product and has shown willingness to negotiate.
* **John's offer as a backup:** I can comfortably reject this offer knowing I have John's offer as a safety net if I can't get a better price from Bob.

I'm going to counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price even closer to my minimum value or at least closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're not willing to go to $11,000.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($11,000) and Bob's current offer ($10,500). 
* **Staying close to my minimum:**  $10,750 is still closer to my minimum value of $15,000 than Bob's offer.
* **Encouraging finality:** I'm emphasizing that this is a ""fair compromise"" and a ""good deal"" for both of us, suggesting that this might be the final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500, but I'd rather meet you at $10,500 than $10,750. Can we meet in the middle at $10,625? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $10,625 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, it's only $875 away.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Bob's offer shows he's willing to go up to $10,500 but is firm on his budget. Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.
* **John's offer as a backup:** I can accept this offer knowing I have John's offer as a safety net if the negotiation falls through.

Considering the potential for a stalemate and the risk of losing the deal altogether, accepting Bob's offer is the most reasonable option."
