"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your desired value, but $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000,  which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
