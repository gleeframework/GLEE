"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I'm hoping to get closer to the $14,000 I initially offered.  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $13000. How about $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $13,000, $12,000 is a good price and it's worth it to close the deal. This is a better deal than selling to John, and I'm confident I can make a profit."
