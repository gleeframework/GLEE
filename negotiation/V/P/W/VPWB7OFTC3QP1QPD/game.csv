"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to meet closer to my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,080,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
