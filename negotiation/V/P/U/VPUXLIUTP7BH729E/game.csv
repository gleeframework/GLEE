"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget.  I hope you'll reconsider my offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
