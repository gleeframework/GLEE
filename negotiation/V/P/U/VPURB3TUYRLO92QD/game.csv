"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1200000 is way outside my price range. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately below my minimum value for this product.  However, I'm willing to come down to $950000 to facilitate a deal. This price still reflects the product's potential, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
