Alice's offer:

This price still reflects the product's potential, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if this works for you.

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer."

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than my budget. I've already rejected her counteroffer twice, and while this product sounds promising, it's not worth risking going over my limit.  I'll go ahead and purchase the product from John for $800,000."
