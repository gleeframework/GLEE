""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and based on my understanding, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. This starting point allows room for discussion and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. "",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer meets our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While we could try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee of reaching a better deal.  It's better to take the certain $1,200,000 from John than risk Bob walking away or further lowering his offer."
