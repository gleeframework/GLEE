"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $105 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.",112.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
