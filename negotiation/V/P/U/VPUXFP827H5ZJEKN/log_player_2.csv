"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $105 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5.
