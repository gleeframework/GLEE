"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price.  It's worth negotiating to see if Alice will go lower."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the product's value to you, which is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a better price than John's, Alice is still far from Bob's desired price. There's room for further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000.  That's closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount. How about $950,000?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept this offer. While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a good compromise and significantly lower than what John is offering. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk of Alice walking away."
