"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the product's value to you, which is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000.  That's closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount. How about $950,000?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
