Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here.  I've significantly lowered my price, showing my willingness to make a deal. However, your offers aren't reflecting a serious intent to find a middle ground. My final offer is $14,000.  Take it or leave it.

Alice is clearly very firm on a price well above your limit.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get you significantly closer to your budget.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed good deal from John."
