Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $19,000 leaves significant room for negotiation while still aiming for a much higher profit.
* **Value-based language:** The message emphasizes the product's ""significant value"" and ""true worth"" to justify the high price, even though you know Bob values it at $10,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The tone suggests you might be open to negotiation, which can be more appealing than a firm, take-it-or-leave-it offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style. If you knew he was very price-sensitive, you might start lower.
* **Risk tolerance:** Starting so high carries the risk of Bob immediately rejecting the offer without counter-offering. You need to be comfortable potentially moving to John."
