"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it then.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $100 for the product. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a little too much for me.  I'm really hoping to get this for closer to $90. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $95? ",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $98. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $95, though. How about $97.50?",97.5,Alice,7,
