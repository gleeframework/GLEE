"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a decent deal, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to try and get a better price.  $90 is still within the price range that Bob is willing to pay, but it's a significant discount from Alice's original offer. This should give Alice some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum of $80.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it then."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm on his goal of getting the product for as close to $80 as possible. Offering $95 is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to negotiate further. This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price while remaining within Bob's acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $100 for the product. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is tempting, it's still above Bob's target price of $80.  He can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and might push Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a little too much for me.  I'm really hoping to get this for closer to $90. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the product as close to his $80 target as possible.  He's making a counteroffer that's a compromise between his previous offer of $95 and Alice's current offer of $100. This shows a willingness to negotiate further while keeping the pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $98. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $95, though. How about $97.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's target price is $80, and while $97.50 is a good price, it's still not within his desired range.  With only a few rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer from Alice outweighs the potential reward of continuing negotiations.  Buying from John for $80 guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price."
