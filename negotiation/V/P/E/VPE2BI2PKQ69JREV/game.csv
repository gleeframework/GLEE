"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $9,500 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $7,000.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. To find common ground, I'd like to suggest a price of $8,500 for the product. This still reflects its true value while being more accessible to you. I hope we can move forward with this proposal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me. I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $7,500? I feel like that's a fair price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. To try to accommodate your budget, I propose a price of $8,250 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise between the original price and your current offer. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle.  $8,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little lower. Would you be willing to consider $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your previous offers, I am willing to accept $8,000 as the final price for the product.
