{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $8,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $7,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price point for this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $8,500. Would you be open to considering that offer?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $8,250 is a fair price and a good compromise. It's above my minimum price and also saves me from the hassle of further negotiation."
