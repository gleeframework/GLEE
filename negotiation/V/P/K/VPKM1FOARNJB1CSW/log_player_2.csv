"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to anchor the price significantly lower. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it leaves room for negotiation while staying well under my $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $160 is still above my budget. I'll counteroffer again, trying to meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $130? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

This counter offer splits the difference between my last offer and her counter offer.  This keeps the negotiation moving while staying within a reasonable range of my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $140. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. $140 is within my budget and a decent savings compared to John's price."
