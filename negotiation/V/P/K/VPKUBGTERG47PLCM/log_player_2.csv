"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better price.  $9,500 is above your budget, and you have the option to buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
``` 

Let's start with your maximum budget.  We'll see if Alice is willing to meet you there."
