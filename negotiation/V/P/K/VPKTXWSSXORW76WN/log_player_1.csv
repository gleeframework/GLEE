Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. He gets a $500 ""discount"" compared to my guaranteed sale price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly eager.  

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
