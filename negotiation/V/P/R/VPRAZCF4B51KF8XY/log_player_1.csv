"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to you is significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $12,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $12,500 is a good deal. It's significantly more than my minimum ($10,000) and a good compromise from my initial ask.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
