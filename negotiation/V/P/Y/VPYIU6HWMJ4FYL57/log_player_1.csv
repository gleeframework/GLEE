"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Optimistic Tone:** I'm using a positive and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm briefly mentioning the value of the product to entice Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation. By starting high, I'm hoping to get Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to eventually reach a price closer to my desired range.  I'm also leaving the door open to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $65 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting it would mean taking a significant loss. While I could sell to John for $100, I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation with Bob just yet.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and try to get a better price. I'll need to make a counteroffer that is more appealing to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm offering a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my starting price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, highlighting that $90 is still a good deal for him.
* **Middle Ground:**  I'm suggesting a ""middle ground"" price to make the offer more appealing and encourage Bob to consider it.

**Strategy:**

By offering a counteroffer closer to my desired range, I'm hoping to keep the negotiation moving forward. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm still keeping the option of selling to John open if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me.  Selling to John would guarantee me a profit, but I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation with Bob just yet.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to counteroffer with a price closer to my target.  It's possible that I may reach a point where selling to John becomes the more attractive option, but for now, I'm focused on seeing if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $75 is closer, but still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $85. This would give you a great deal on a valuable product, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but not by too much.  
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and that $85 is still a good price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping a positive tone to encourage continued negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be close enough to Bob's desired price that he will accept. If he rejects it, I will have to consider selling to John in the next round. However, I'm still optimistic that we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further.  How about $78? That's a very fair offer and would allow me to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, it's still below my desired range. I want to maximize my profit and see if I can push for a slightly higher price. Selling to John would guarantee me a profit, but I'm not giving up on Bob just yet.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $85. I'm hopeful that with continued negotiation, we can find a price that works for both of us.  However, I'll be closely monitoring the situation and may opt to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob start to drag on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  While $78 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that allows me to make a fair profit.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $81?  This would allow you to get a great deal on the product while ensuring I can cover my costs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 81}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm continuing to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price point above my minimum.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that $81 is a fair price for both of us.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using a slightly more urgent tone by suggesting we find a solution that works for both of us. This adds a sense of time pressure and encourages Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This is a crucial round. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects it, I will likely opt to sell to John in the next round. I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a quick deal."
