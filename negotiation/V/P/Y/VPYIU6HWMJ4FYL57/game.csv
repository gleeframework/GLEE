"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $65 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $75 is closer, but still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $85. This would give you a great deal on a valuable product, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further.  How about $78? That's a very fair offer and would allow me to get a good deal.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  While $78 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that allows me to make a fair profit.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $81?  This would allow you to get a great deal on the product while ensuring I can cover my costs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",81.0,Alice,7,
