Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $75 is closer, but still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $85.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  While $78 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that allows me to make a fair profit.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $81?  This would allow you to get a great deal on the product while ensuring I can cover my costs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $80, and you can get the product for that price from John without further negotiation."
