"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it, but $100 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95. This is a great deal for you, and it's still within my range. Let's make this happen!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price. $95 is closer but still a little above my limit.  Would you be willing to go down to $90? This is my absolute best offer. Let's see if we can make this work.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  $92.50 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $91?  This is my very last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",91.0,Bob,6,
