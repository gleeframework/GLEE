{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  It gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This keeps the negotiation going without immediately pushing Bob away.

I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I'm really interested in your product, but that's my top limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $12,000. I want to see if I can push Bob higher.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, and $10,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget. Would you consider $10,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $10,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal.  I'm not confident I can push Bob higher, and I don't want to risk losing time and energy in more negotiations.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm happy with.  I'll sell to John."
