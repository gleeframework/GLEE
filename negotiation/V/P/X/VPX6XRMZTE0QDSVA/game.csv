"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still not able to meet you halfway. I would like to propose $1,025,000 as a compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,037,500. This is a fair price that takes into account both of our needs. Let's close this deal.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts, Alice. However, I'm unable to agree to $1,037,500. I'd like to propose $1,030,000 as a final offer.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,030,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,035,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1035000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal, and I would like to counter with an offer of $1,028,000.",1028000.0,Bob,8,
