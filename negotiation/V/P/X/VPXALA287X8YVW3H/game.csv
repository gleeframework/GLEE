"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on it, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably go. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a good starting point for us to finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
