"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and features, I'm initially offering it at $22,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate down from that price, or even consider buying from John if the negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $10,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet halfway? I could let it go for $16,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $16,000 is better, it's still a long way from my budget and from John's offer.  I'll try to negotiate further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could potentially stretch my budget to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit."",
 ""product_price"": 12000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,000 is still quite a bit below what I'd be comfortable with.  How about we settle on $14,000? That's a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a long way from a good deal. I'll push a little further, but I need to be prepared to walk away and go with John if she doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has value, but I need to be realistic with my budget. $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I can offer you $12,500, but that's my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options."",
 ""product_price"": 12500
}
