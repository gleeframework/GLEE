Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and I'm not willing to go lower. Accepting his offer or continuing to haggle will likely result in the same outcome - selling for $1,200,000.  It's time to take John's guaranteed offer."
