Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum value, I believe the product is worth more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, $16,000 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum and selling to John would only net me $15,000."
