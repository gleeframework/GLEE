"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to get a lower price. It's likely Alice will be willing to lower the price slightly to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between my maximum value ($100) and Alice's minimum value ($80). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to be flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is within my acceptable range. While I'd prefer to pay less, it's unlikely she'll go lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price without further risk."
