Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if we can reach an agreement.

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum and there's a risk of him walking away or me having to lower the price further.  It's a good deal to get the sale done."
