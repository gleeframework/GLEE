"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate lower.  $900,000 is a good deal, but there's room to potentially save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $800,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range I'm willing to pay.  I'm hoping this will encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant saving from her initial offer, and still within my budget.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal without risking losing the opportunity altogether."
