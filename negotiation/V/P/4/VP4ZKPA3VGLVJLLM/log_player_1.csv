Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, offering it slightly below my guaranteed price leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's particularly interested.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly rather than overthink the offer. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer, but it represents the best chance to get the highest price before going with my guaranteed sale to John."
