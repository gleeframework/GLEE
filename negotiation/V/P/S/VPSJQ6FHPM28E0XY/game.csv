,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $105 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $132.50",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $115, Bob. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $125. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
