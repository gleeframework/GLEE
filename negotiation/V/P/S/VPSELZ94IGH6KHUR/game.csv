"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to make a deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to me. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $890,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,7,
