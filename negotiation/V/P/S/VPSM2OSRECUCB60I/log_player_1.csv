Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a little below your minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that you are serious about selling to Bob and want to find a mutually agreeable price.  

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While $9,500 is less than your minimum, it's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate upwards.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without risking a deal completely falling through.
* **Balance with Plan B:**  It's important to remember that you can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000, so there's no need to be too aggressive with your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low to consider at this stage.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.  

I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price than $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.  I'm confident that $8,500 is a fair price for both of us, and it gives Bob the opportunity to either accept or propose a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm trying to stay closer to $8,000.  Would you consider $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to sell the product for less than my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $8,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 8250}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but it also protects my minimum value. I believe that $8,250 is a fair price that balances both our interests.  It's also a strong signal that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that's too low."
