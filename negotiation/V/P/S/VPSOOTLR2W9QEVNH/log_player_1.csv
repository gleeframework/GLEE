{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $8,750? That's still a great deal for you, considering what the product is worth to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8600. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $9,000, Bob's offer of $8,600 is a reasonable compromise and getting closer to my minimum.  It's important to close the deal and avoid risking losing the sale altogether."
