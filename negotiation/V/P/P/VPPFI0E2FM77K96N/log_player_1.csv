Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. Here's why:

* **It's significantly higher than your floor price:**  This demonstrates your confidence in the value of the product.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a strong incentive to buy, as he'll still be making a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counter-offers, you have space to bargain while still achieving a good profit. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
