Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its worth to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can then gauge his interest and make a counteroffer closer to his valuation.  

Remember, you can always sell to John for $10,000, so you have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum valuation of $10,000.  You have a better option with John, and it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my target, Alice. I can go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,800 is tempting, it's still below your minimum valuation.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can close the gap. You have John as a backup if this fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,400?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can go up to $8,900, but that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut your losses and move on. Bob is not willing to meet your minimum valuation, and you have a guaranteed $10,000 sale with John.  It's not ideal, but it's the best option to secure a reasonable profit."
