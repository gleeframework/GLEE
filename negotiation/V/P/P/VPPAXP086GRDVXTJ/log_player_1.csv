Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum value.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid potentially getting stuck with a lower price or having to deal with further negotiations."
