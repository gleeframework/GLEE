"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $9,500?  This would be a good compromise and get us closer to a deal. ",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're willing to make a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $11,000? This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $11,000 is still out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again, but I can't go above $10,000.  Let's try to make this happen. ",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $11,500? This is the last offer I can make, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
