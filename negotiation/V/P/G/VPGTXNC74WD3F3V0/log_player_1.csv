"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be happy to offer you $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a slight increase, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not ready to settle for less than what I know the product is worth.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $950,000 is still not enough.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This price is fair, it's closer to my valuation of the product, and it gives you a better deal than my initial offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I can justify. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,000,000, which reflects the value I place on this product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. It's my minimum acceptable price, and Bob is committed to closing the deal. I'd rather secure this sale than risk further negotiation with Bob or selling to John for the same price."
