"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be happy to offer you $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $950,000 is still not enough.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This price is fair, it's closer to my valuation of the product, and it gives you a better deal than my initial offer. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I can justify. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,000,000, which reflects the value I place on this product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
