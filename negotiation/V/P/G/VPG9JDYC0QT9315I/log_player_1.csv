I'm starting with a price of $175.  This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but I believe it's a fair starting point. I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While I'm happy to sell the product for $150 to John, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm coming down to $165. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."

Bob seems determined to only pay $150. While I would have liked to earn more, it's time to stop wasting time.  John is a sure thing, and I'm happy to take $150 for the product."
