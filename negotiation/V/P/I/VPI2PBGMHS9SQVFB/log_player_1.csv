Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget for this purchase is significantly lower.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.

Bob's offer:

I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product to me and acknowledges your need to make a profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price. John guarantees I get my desired amount without further negotiation."
