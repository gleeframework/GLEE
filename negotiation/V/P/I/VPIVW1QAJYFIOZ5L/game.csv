"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000? This price still offers you a significant advantage, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, I'm working with a tight budget, and $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,325,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the circumstances.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
