Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to make a significant investment, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $810,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice is firm on her price and unwilling to go below $810,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
