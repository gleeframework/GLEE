"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position Alice, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While the product is valuable, my budget is firm. Would you consider $760,000? This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a significant investment, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $810,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",810000.0,Alice,5,
