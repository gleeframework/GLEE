# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your alternative."
