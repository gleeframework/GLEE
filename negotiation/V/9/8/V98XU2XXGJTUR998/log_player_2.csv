Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to push for a better price.  It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to establish a good starting point for negotiations."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price below $1,000,000.  Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, and this move keeps the pressure on to get a good deal."
