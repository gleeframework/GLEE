Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but the $1,800,000 price is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, reflecting the value I see in the product and giving you a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
