You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than her initial asking price, you can still do better.  You'll counteroffer and try to get closer to your $80 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $100 is still higher than your desired price.  You can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a little hesitant at $100.  Would you be willing to go down to $95?  That's the absolute highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is just not workable for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50.  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll be selling the product to John for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice is firm on her price, and it's still above your limit. It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer. You'll save more money in the long run."
