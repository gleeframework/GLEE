"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of that, I am willing to consider your counteroffer. However, I need to maintain a reasonable margin for us to continue doing business. Therefore, I am proposing a counter-counteroffer of $1050000 for the product. This still allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount compared to its worth. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
