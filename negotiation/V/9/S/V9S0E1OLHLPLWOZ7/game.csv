"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,300,000 represents the high-end of the product's value, I understand your perspective.  Let's meet closer to the middle ground. Would you consider $1,950,000?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $1,950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. It seems we both see the value in this product.  How about we settle on $1,825,000? This represents a significant compromise on my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1,600,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
