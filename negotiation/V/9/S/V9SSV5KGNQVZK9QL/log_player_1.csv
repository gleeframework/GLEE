"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to me to create a sense of urgency and potentially increase Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which is key to keeping the negotiation going. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** The offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $15,000, I want to see if I can secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Round:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $11,500 to make this work. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, so I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise & Reason:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway, but justifying it with a reason. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm price in mind.
* **Emphasize Discount:**  Highlighting the ""significant discount"" from my initial offer adds pressure and emphasizes a sense of urgency. 
* **Above Minimum:** $11,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me some wiggle room if Bob counters again.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground with Bob. This counteroffer is a firm stance while still showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose $11,000 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price, it's getting very close to it. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  If I reject this offer and continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob might back out entirely or I might not be able to reach a better deal in the remaining rounds.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, I need to make a decision. 

**Overall:**  Considering the risk of losing the deal and the fact that this offer is almost at my minimum, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best choice at this point."
