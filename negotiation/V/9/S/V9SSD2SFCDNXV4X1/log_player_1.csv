I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob seems unwilling to budge further, and I'm not willing to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate.  It's time to take the sure thing and move on."
