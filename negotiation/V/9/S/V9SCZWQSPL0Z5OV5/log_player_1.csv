Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value in this product, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
