"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $750,000 just yet. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800,000.  This is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not ready to accept $800,000 just yet. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $810,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",810000.0,Bob,6,
