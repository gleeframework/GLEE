"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $140 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you be open to $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $95.  To be fair, how about we settle at $120?  This is my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
