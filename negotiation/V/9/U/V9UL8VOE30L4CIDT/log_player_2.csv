"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a discount. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $11,250 is lower than the $12,000 John is asking.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has moved from $11,000 to $11,250, showing a willingness to negotiate. Accepting is a good way to finalize the deal without risking further rounds of negotiation."
