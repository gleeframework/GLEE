Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not losing money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It reflects the value to Bob:**  The price is closer to Bob's perceived value than your minimum, making it more likely he'll consider it. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can either counteroffer again or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer. You have room to negotiate, and selling to John at $12,000 is the absolute last resort.  

**Next Steps:**

You will now send Bob a counteroffer.  A good counteroffer might be:

* **$13,500:** This is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's. It shows flexibility while still protecting your profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,250 is my final offer. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Slightly lower than your previous offer:** You're demonstrating flexibility, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate.
* **Above your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **Midpoint between your last offer and Bob's:**  This shows a willingness to compromise. 

This counteroffer is a good strategy because it gives Bob a chance to accept and close the deal without having to make a counteroffer himself. It also positions you for potential acceptance while still protecting your financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is now just $250 below your desired price. This is a small enough difference that it's worth accepting.  While you could try to counteroffer again, it's possible the negotiation could continue to drag on, and there's a chance Bob could ultimately walk away. 

Selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, but it's a worse outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale at a price that's close to your target and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal entirely."
