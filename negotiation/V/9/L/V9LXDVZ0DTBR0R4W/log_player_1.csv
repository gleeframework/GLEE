Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves some room for your profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
