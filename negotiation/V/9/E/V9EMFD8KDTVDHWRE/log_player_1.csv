Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is far too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have other options.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, but I need to be careful about my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we are running out of time. I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not the ideal price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking getting an even lower offer."
