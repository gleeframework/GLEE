"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be impressed.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could we possibly agree on $13,500?  I feel that's a fair price.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $15,000 is the absolute lowest I can go and still make this deal worthwhile.  I'm confident this is a fair offer for a product of this quality.",15000.0,Alice,5,
