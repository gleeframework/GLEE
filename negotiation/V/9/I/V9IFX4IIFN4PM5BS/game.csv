"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to let it go for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $125? That seems like a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now willing to let it go for $127. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair deal.",127.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $127 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $122. This is my final offer.",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $122 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $122 and my minimum price of $120. I'm now willing to let it go for $121. This is my final offer.",121.0,Alice,7,
