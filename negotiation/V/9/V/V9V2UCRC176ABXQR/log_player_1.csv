"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and signals that you believe the product is worth significantly more than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, preventing Bob from feeling alienated by the high initial price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a backup willing to pay your minimum allows you to confidently aim high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your openness to discussion. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. It's highly likely we can secure a better deal by countering. We started high to create this room for negotiation. Accepting his first counteroffer could signal we're willing to settle quickly, potentially leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident this product offers significant value that justifies a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate by significantly decreasing from the initial offer.
* **Strong Stance:**  The message still emphasizes the product's value and maintains a price point considerably above Bob's offer.
* **Middle Ground:** Proposing a price directly in the middle can be a persuasive tactic, potentially making Bob feel like he's getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your perspective, but based on my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 represents a strong profit margin above your minimum acceptable price. While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. It's often better to secure a good deal than risk losing it for a potentially marginal gain."
