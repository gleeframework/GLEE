"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your insights, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on wanting to find a fair deal. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway from my initial offer, the value of this product extends significantly beyond $1,200,000, particularly for your specific applications.  How about we settle at $1,350,000?  This feels like a strong compromise that recognizes the product's true worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget of $1,500,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000.
