"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is your maximum value for the product, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately.  By rejecting the offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to try and get a better deal, so it's worth exploring that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing my intent to negotiate.  It's also below my maximum value, giving me some room to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is within my acceptable range and represents a good compromise. Accepting this offer saves me $10 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, I'm willing to accept this deal to avoid risking a breakdown in negotiations and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
