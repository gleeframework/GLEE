Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, so starting with a price closer to his valuation makes sense.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $120 is a strong starting point, it leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Securing a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $120 or slightly below is significantly better than your $80 backup option with John."
