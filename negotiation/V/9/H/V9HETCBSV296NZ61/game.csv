"I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I can offer $8000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11500.  Let's make this work!",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer $9250. Can we meet in the middle?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9250 is still a little too low for me. Let's try $10500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $9500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it from you. Can you consider it?",9500.0,Bob,6,
