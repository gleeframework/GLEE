"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to sell the product for $1000000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering its value.  Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,3,
