"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll find fascinating. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me is at least $800000. I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700000.  I understand the product is valuable to you, but I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price point. Let's explore that option.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price is $700000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $775000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is a significant step from my initial offer. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand you're willing to go up to $750000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $765000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you've placed on it and the value I've placed on it. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,5,
