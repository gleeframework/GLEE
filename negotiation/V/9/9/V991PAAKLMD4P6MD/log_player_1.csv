"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price.  I'll be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product to me. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $16,000, which is only $1,000 less than my ideal price.  Considering the risk of further negotiation, I'll take the offer and sell the product to Bob."
