"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice,  $14,000 is a good starting point. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay $12,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's willing to pay more than his initial offer but doesn't want to give in to Alice's offer right away.  He'll try to counteroffer again to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13,000.  I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and it would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'd like to propose a slight increase to $13,200. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been pushing to get the price down and has gotten it down to $13,200, which is a good deal for him. It's still less than what John is selling it for and only slightly more than Bob's last offer. Accepting the offer allows him to close the deal and secure the product, potentially saving him $1,800 compared to buying from John. There are only 5 rounds left, and it's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a lower price at this point."
