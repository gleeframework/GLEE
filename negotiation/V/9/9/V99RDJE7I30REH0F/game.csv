"Thanks Alice,  $14,000 is a good starting point. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay $12,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13,000.  I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'd like to propose a slight increase to $13,200. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",13200.0,Alice,5,
