"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm personally valuing at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair for both of us.  Let's say $12,000.  This would give you a great deal, and it would allow me to earn a decent profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to negotiate further with Alice or potentially find another seller with a lower price."
