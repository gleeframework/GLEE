"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm personally valuing at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair for both of us.  Let's say $12,000.  This would give you a great deal, and it would allow me to earn a decent profit. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
