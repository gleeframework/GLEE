Alice's offer:

This represents a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement. Let's work together to make this happen.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 saves us money even though we could potentially negotiate a slightly better deal with Alice."
