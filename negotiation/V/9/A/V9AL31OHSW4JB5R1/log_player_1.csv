{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the value for Bob and the fairness of the price, creating a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where:

* I can potentially secure a good price.
* Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's losing out.

This approach balances my desire for a high price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Although Bob's offer is low, he is willing to negotiate. There's still room for a counteroffer to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a safety net:**  The option to sell to John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net, ensuring I don't have to settle for an unacceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a compromise."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference between our previous offers and settle at $950,000? It's a win-win for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate further. This indicates a potential for a better offer.
* **John remains a safety net:**  The option to sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the security of not having to settle for a price that's significantly below my product's worth.
