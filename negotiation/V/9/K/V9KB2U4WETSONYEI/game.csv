"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget with $8,500. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,800 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,200? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're interested!",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I think I can do a bit better than $8,200. How about we meet at $7,900? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",7900.0,Bob,6,
