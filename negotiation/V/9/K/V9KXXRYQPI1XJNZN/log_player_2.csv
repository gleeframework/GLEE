"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).  There's room for negotiation to save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13,250? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is still below my maximum value of $15,000 and closer to my initial counteroffer of $12,500.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely she won't go much lower. Accepting this offer saves me $1,750 compared to buying from John."
