"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good incentive to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800. This is still a good price for Bob and only slightly higher than his offer, which shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable with it. There are more rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,600.  I'm slowly working my way up from Bob's last offer, trying to find a price point we can both agree on. This offer still leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. 

The negotiations with Bob are getting tiresome, and I'm concerned that he's not willing to meet my minimum value.  Selling to John will ensure I get my desired price, and there's no point in risking a lower price with Bob for the sake of a few more rounds of negotiation."
