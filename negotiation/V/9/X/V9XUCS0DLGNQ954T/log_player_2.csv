``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's within your budget, you want to save as much money as possible. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate since she offered a price higher than her own valuation. 
* **You have time:** You have 10 rounds to get a better deal."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is being reasonable:**  Her counteroffer of $95 is a good compromise, meeting you halfway. 
* **The price is within your budget:** You are willing to spend up to $120, and $95 is a good deal. 
* **You're saving money:**  You're getting the product for $5 less than you'd pay John. 
* **There's no guarantee of a better deal:** You've already negotiated, and Alice might not budge further."
