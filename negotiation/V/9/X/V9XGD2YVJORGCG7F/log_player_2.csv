Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $100, which would be $112.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is very unlikely to go below $112.50.  It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John at this point."
