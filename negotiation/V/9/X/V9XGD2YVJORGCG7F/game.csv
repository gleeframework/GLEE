"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be honest, $100 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $100, which would be $112.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
