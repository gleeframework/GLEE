,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $13,750. This feels like a fair compromise.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000, so I'm thinking $12,500. Can we meet in the middle at that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
