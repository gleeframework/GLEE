I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but still higher than my minimum. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $1,600,000 is a good deal and is within my acceptable range.  I don't want to risk losing this sale by continuing to negotiate."
