"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price that is closer to my minimum value than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Positive and open:**  My message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Justification:**  I provide a reason for my price to make it seem more reasonable. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the next round.
* If the negotiations stall or I don't feel confident about getting a good price, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done some research and I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation room:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my minimum value. 
* **Avoiding immediate sale:** Selling to John now would guarantee me my minimum, but I'm hoping to get a better price through negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired price. I'll try to maintain a positive and open tone, while also emphasizing the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Given the product's unique features and potential, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm reducing my price from $12,000 to $11,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justifying the price:** I highlight the product's unique features and potential to justify the price.
* **Positive and compromising tone:** I use phrases like ""significant concession"" and ""fair compromise"" to emphasize that I'm trying to meet Bob halfway.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a higher price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next offer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll keep in mind that I can still sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room for improvement.  I can counter with a price closer to my minimum while acknowledging Bob's increased offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John now would guarantee me my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price between Bob's offer of $10,000 and my minimum of $15,000. I will emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to compromise, but I will also make it clear that I'm not willing to go below a certain point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits of this product and the value it brings, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would be a significant compromise on my part, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our needs. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's current offer of $10,000.
* **Emphasizing value:** I continue to remind Bob of the product's unique benefits and value to justify the price.
* **Expressing willingness to compromise:** I reiterate my flexibility by using phrases like ""significant compromise"" and ""fair price.""

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my minimum.
* If Bob rejects, I will assess his next offer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I can still sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Limited negotiation room:**  With only 4 rounds left, the likelihood of Bob significantly increasing his offer is low.  
* **Guarantee my minimum:** Selling to John now guarantees me my minimum price and prevents any risk of further negotiation losses.

**Next Steps:**

Since Bob's offer is unlikely to meet my minimum, I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I receive the highest possible price for my product."
