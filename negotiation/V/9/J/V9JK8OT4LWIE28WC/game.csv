"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  While I recognize the value this product brings to your specific needs, the price of $1,400,000 undervalues its broader market potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
