{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum of $100, but still lower than John's offer. This leaves some room for negotiation and gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, that's a great price, but I'm really looking to stay under $80. How about $85? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I need to try and get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50.  Let's meet in the middle at $88.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88

$88 is still below my minimum, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counteroffer again."
