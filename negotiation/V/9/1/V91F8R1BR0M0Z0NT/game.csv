"Hi Alice, that's a great price, but I'm really looking to stay under $80. How about $85? Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50.  Let's meet in the middle at $88.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $88 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $90. I'm feeling flexible and I really want to make this deal work. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
