"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,500? I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see that you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to pay that, we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
