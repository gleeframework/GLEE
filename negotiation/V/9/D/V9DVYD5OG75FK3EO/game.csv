"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable going up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
