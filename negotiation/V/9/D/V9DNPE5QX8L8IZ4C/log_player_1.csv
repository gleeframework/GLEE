{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $100."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin for you. This price also makes it highly likely Bob will accept, as he gains $20 in value ($120 valuation - $100 price). 

**Why not higher?**  While you could start higher, it risks Bob rejecting the offer outright.  A price of $100 strikes a good balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring a successful sale."
