Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is only worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Power:** You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer.

**Strategy**

The goal is to find a price Bob is willing to pay that's still significantly above his $1,000,000 valuation. Since you have a strong alternative, you can aim high.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes exclusivity and value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 is significantly above Bob's valuation but potentially tempting enough for him to consider, especially if he's convinced of the product's ""return on investment.""
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price that's even more beneficial for you.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible approach. You could start with an even higher price, but this offer balances ambition with a reasonable chance of acceptance."
