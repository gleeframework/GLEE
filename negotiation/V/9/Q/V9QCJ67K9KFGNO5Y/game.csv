"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $18000 is a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $10000 to make this work. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still a little out of my range.  I'm very serious about purchasing this product, but I can only go up to $12000.  Let's try to bridge that gap. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're serious about purchasing the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you at $13500. This is the lowest I can go without compromising the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13500 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12500, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as high as $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13500 and $12500, which would be $13000. This is the best I can do without losing money on the deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $13000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12800, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to seriously consider my options.",12800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a serious effort to reach a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as high as $12800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $12800, which would be $12900. This is the best I can do without losing money on the deal.",12900.0,Alice,9,
