"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for us to find a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
