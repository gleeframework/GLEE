Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and you know it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You're still making a profit, and you have a backup buyer in John.

**Remember:** This is just a starting point. You can adjust the price depending on how much you think Bob will pay and how confident you feel about selling to John."
