Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be immensely valuable to you, just as it has been to me. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product has a high floor price ($1,000,000) thanks to John's guaranteed purchase. This allows for ambitious negotiation.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above that price.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets a strong anchor point, potentially leading Bob to counter-offer closer to your desired range than if you started lower.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. A more nuanced approach might involve multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers to feel out Bob's willingness to pay."
