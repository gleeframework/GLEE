"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely get a better price. While Alice is willing to compromise, the offer is still $200,000 above Bob's maximum.  It's worth negotiating further to try and get closer to his target price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is valuable to me, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm happy to pay $1,050,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. This price still reflects the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, it's still $150,000 above his limit. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if they can reach an agreement.  If Alice rejects again, Bob can then go to John and buy the product for his maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. $1,150,000 is closer, but unfortunately still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a very fair compromise for both of us. This would allow you to gain a significant return, while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, which is a slight increase from your last offer. I believe this price reflects the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point. Let's work together to make it happen!

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,120,000 is still $120,000 above Bob's maximum price.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point.  It's best to move on to John and buy the product for $1,000,000, which is within Bob's budget."
