"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the price in Bob's mind at a higher point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering at $1,400,000 leaves space to negotiate downwards while still staying significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The tone is positive and invites Bob's perspective, allowing me to assess his eagerness and potential flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is significantly below my target price and even below the midpoint between our initial positions. While it's higher than John's offer, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, especially with 9 rounds remaining.  I'll aim for a counteroffer that brings him closer to $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,100,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair offer considering the unique value this brings."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** My message reiterates the product's value while acknowledging Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  I've made a substantial concession of $50,000 from my initial price, signaling willingness to negotiate but not desperation. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The $1,350,000 price point still keeps me within a profitable range and above Bob's initial offer, aiming for a compromise closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand the value, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is definitely engaged and negotiating, which is a good sign. While $1,225,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for at least $1,300,000. With 7 rounds left, there's room to push a little further. I'll make a smaller concession this time to show him I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I can see you're serious about this product.  To show I'm flexible, I'll come down to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring to $1,300,000:** I'm sticking to my guns at $1,300,000 â€“ a price point I've now mentioned twice, subtly reinforcing it. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By declaring this my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to encourage Bob to act quickly and seriously consider accepting.
* **Leaving Room for a Slight Concession:** While unlikely, I'm leaving a tiny bit of room to potentially drop to $1,290,000 in a later round if needed, but only as a last resort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair offer considering we're getting close to the end of the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,250,000 is a significant profit margin, well above my $1,000,000 minimum and John's standing offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  After six rounds, both sides are likely feeling the pressure. Prolonging negotiations might lead to frustration and potentially make Bob walk away.
* **Limited Upside:**  Bob has consistently moved upwards in his offers. It's unlikely he'll suddenly jump to $1,300,000, and risking a lower offer in later rounds isn't worth it. 

Accepting at $1,250,000 secures a great deal without jeopardizing the entire negotiation."
