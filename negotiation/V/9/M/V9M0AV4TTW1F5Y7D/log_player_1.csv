"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm confident that I can get a better price than $8,500, and I'm not willing to sell to John for less than $9,000 yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Even though Bob's offer is at my minimum price, I'm going to try and get a better deal. I'm going to counter-offer again, hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. There are still several rounds left, so I can afford to be a little stubborn."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need at least $8,750 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 8750}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob. I believe there's still room for a higher price. I'll counter-offer again and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my minimum price point, and Bob is still hesitant to go higher.  With only two rounds left, I don't have much time to get a better deal.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $8,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
