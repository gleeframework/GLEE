"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and a good deal considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, how about $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I can't go as low as $6,500, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
