"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value to Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** This allows for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away. 
* **Strategic Backup:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John open if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $5,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000, and even below Bob's perceived value of $8,000. Accepting this would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows his interest. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps my options open. I can counter with a price closer to my value and still have the option to sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and a good deal considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price range, but still taking into account his budget constraints.
* **Justified Reduction:**  I'm highlighting the reduction from my initial offer to make it appear more appealing to Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential compromise in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, how about $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  I see an opportunity to push Bob closer to my desired price range. I can counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, making it more appealing to Bob without sacrificing too much.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I keep the option to sell to John open, ensuring I don't settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I can't go as low as $6,500, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price but still holding firm on a price that's more favorable to me.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" which can appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging further discussion.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still leaving the option to sell to John open,  ensuring I don't get trapped in a deal that doesn't meet my minimum value."
