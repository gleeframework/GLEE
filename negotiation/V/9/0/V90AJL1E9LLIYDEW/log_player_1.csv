"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a strong opening that gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. I'm confident that I can get at least $8,000 from John if I need to, so this leaves some wiggle room to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to get closer to my desired price. I believe this is a fair offer that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $9,200 is a good deal and allows me to sell the product without risking a lower price from John. This is a good compromise, and it's better to secure the deal than to risk a lower offer in the future rounds."
