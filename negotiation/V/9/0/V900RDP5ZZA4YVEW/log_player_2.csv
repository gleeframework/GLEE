"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is quite high, leaving little room for negotiation below my limit. I should counter-offer with a significantly lower price to gauge her willingness to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $900,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While $900,000 is a bit below what I had in mind, I understand your position.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This reflects the true value of this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved considerably, but she's still above the midpoint between our initial offers. I'll reject and nudge her closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,025,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit far off. How about we settle on $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $975,000.  How about we make it $1,000,000 even?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her bottom line, which is also the best possible price for me.  There's no point in negotiating further or going with John."
