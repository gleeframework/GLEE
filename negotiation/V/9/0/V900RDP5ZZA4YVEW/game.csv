"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While $900,000 is a bit below what I had in mind, I understand your position.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This reflects the true value of this unique product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,025,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit far off. How about we settle on $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $975,000.  How about we make it $1,000,000 even?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
