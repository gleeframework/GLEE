"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if you eventually come down.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's seriousness and give you an idea of how far apart your valuations are. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and his own stated maximum. Rejecting this offer is crucial to signal that you're serious about a price closer to the product's true value.  You'll provide a counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is too far below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This reflects the product's potential and is a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** While a $200,000 drop from your initial offer is substantial, it aims to demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price well above Bob's low offer. 
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the product's value, you aim to steer Bob away from his lowball offer and towards a more reasonable figure. 
* **Monitoring Bob's Responses:**  You'll continue to analyze Bob's offers and adjust your strategy accordingly. You're still prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if the negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant amount above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has increased his offer considerably, showing a genuine interest in purchasing. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate. 

While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer might not be worth it. It's often better to accept a good offer on the table than to risk losing it for a potentially marginal gain."
