"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still unable to go above $8,000 for the product. Would $8,500 be acceptable to you?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still not a viable option for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,750. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",8750.0,Alice,5,
