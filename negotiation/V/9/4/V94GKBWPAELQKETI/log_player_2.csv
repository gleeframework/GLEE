Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! I'll meet you at $125, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $125.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $120, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $5."
