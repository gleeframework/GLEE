# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you the product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can likely get a better price than $130, so it's worth negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still closer to your target price of $120, so it's worth trying to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $130.  It's a fair price for both of us and I'm ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $132? It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise to make a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you can still try to negotiate further, at this point, Alice is showing a willingness to compromise and $132 is close to your target.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
