"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $100 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He will attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum. He's offering $90, which is still higher than Alice's value, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This signals a willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about $95? It's a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $95 is still below Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **Negotiation is getting close:** Further bargaining may not yield a significantly lower price, and there's a risk of Alice walking away.
* **Time is a factor:** With limited rounds, accepting a reasonable offer ensures a purchase without risking running out of time."
