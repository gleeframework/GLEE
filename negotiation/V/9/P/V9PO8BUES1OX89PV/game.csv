Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $8200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I think $8200 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7800 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $8000. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
