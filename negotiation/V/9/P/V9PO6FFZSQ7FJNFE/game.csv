"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $500,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept such a low offer. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a little too steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850,000 to get this deal done. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to accept $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $850,000. I'll offer it to you for $987,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",987500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I think $987,500 is still a tad high, I'm willing to split the difference between our last two offers. How about $918,750?",918750.0,Bob,8,
