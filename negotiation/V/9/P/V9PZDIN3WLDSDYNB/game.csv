"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your minimum. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1475000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. I'm running out of time, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
