Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting high, but not unreasonably so. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have to consider lowering my price, but I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value of $1,500,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your minimum. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's above my minimum, it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1350000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'm not sure how many more rounds we can go through before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price that takes both our needs into consideration. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1550000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000. This price is within my budget and is closer to my valuation of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm getting worried about the time running out, but I'm going to counteroffer one more time and see if we can reach an agreement. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,475,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. I'm running out of time, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 1475000}
