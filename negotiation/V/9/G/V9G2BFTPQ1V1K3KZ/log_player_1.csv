Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $180 is close to my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that price.  I'll see if I can get a better price in the next round.  I'm starting to get a little concerned that I might need to sell to John, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're running out of time, and Bob seems unwilling to budge.  I can't afford to keep going back and forth. While I'd like to get a higher price, I'm not going to risk losing the deal completely.  John's offer is guaranteed, and it's better than risking it all with Bob."
