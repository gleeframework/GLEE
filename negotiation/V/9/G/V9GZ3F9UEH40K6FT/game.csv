"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we try $8,800? It's a small concession, but I think it's a reasonable compromise.",8800.0,Alice,5,
