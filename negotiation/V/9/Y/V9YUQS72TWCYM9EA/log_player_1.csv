{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this to be a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves space for negotiation if Bob counters. It signals that I'm willing to engage but also value the product highly.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While I know Bob values it at $800,000, my opening offer acknowledges that he might be willing to go higher for something he truly wants. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing the best possible deal with Bob and ensuring I don't miss out on a profitable sale to John."
