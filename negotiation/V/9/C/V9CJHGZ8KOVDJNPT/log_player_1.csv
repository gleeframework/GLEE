**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is holding firm at $1,350,000. While we could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk he won't budge and we'll end up with a worse deal or having to sell to John for our bottom line. Accepting $1,350,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
