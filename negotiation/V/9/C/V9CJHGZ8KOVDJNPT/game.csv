"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,600,000, so I'll offer $1,400,000. Can we agree on that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
