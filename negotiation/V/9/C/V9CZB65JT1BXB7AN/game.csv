"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $90 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $87.50?  That seems fair to us both.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $87.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $86.  If you're not able to accept that, I may have to consider other options.",86.0,Bob,4,
