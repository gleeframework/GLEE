"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm offering a reason for the price to make it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which is likely since the price is above his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product. This gives me room to counteroffer and potentially find a price we can both agree on. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If the negotiation falls apart, I can still sell to John for $100, which is my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $65 is far below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to compromise to make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  The message emphasizes that I'm offering a compromise, making it seem more fair and reasonable. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he's showing a willingness to negotiate, which gives me room to counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I can still sell to John for $100, which is my minimum, if I don't reach a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $75 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to justify the price. This can help Bob see the value in paying a little more.
* **Win-Win:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** Since we're nearing the end of the negotiation, this offer represents a final attempt to find a compromise with Bob. If he rejects it, I'll have to decide whether to accept John's offer or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you do $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only four rounds left, I need to be strategic.  While John's offer of $100 is appealing, I still have time to try and negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Negotiating for a higher price:**  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground. 

It's important to note that with each round, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases.  However, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle on $81? This is the best I can do, and it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 81}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still slightly above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise without dropping my price too low.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This framing makes the offer seem fairer and more likely to be accepted.
* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as my best offer, creating pressure on Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to be decisive. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider accepting John's offer of $100 to avoid the risk of losing the deal completely."
