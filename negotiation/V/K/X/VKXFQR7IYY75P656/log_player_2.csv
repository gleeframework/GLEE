"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can do better than $11,000. There's still room for negotiation to bring the price down closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $9,500? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At $10,500, you're still saving $1,500 compared to buying from John, and it's a good deal for Alice. It's a mutually beneficial agreement."
