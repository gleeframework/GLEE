Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $105. It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $105 is a good deal for me. I was thinking more like $95. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a higher price, but if it doesn't work, I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little more and offer the product for $100. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to buying from John, but I'm willing to give you one last chance. I'll meet you at $98. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $98 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm hesitant to continue negotiating with Bob. He's clearly trying to push me down to a lower price, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable deal in the remaining rounds. 

To ensure a guaranteed sale and a price that is at least my minimum, I will sell the product to John for $100."
