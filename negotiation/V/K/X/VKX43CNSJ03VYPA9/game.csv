"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I can tell this product would be valuable to you. How about we do this - $14,500 and we have a deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $14,500 is still a bit steep for my budget. I could do $13,500, and I think that's a very fair offer.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to compromise to close this deal.  Let's make it $14,000 even, and we can both walk away happy. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,7,
