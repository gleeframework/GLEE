The product is too expensive.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

I'm starting with a low offer, knowing John is selling for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice is still too high. It's worth another round of counteroffers."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate, but still staying below my maximum. This should encourage Alice to come down a bit more."

I'm going up again, but only slightly, to show continued interest while still staying below my maximum. It's a risk, but I'm hoping Alice will be motivated to close the deal at this point."
