"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he starts with an offer slightly above that.  This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's previous offer. However, Bob is still confident he can negotiate a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about buying while still staying within his budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, bridging the gap between his previous offer and Alice's last one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. However, it's getting closer to Bob's maximum limit. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, with the hope that Alice will eventually lower her price further. There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is nearing his limit but still hopes to get a better price than Alice's last offer. This counteroffer is a slight increase from his previous one, showing Alice he's serious about a deal but not willing to go much higher.  This strategy allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a deal within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer to his limit.  However, Bob is confident he can negotiate a better deal. With only a few rounds left, rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to compromise. There's a possibility Alice might be willing to lower her price to secure a deal before Bob decides to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a risky move, but with only a few rounds left, Bob needs to show Alice he's willing to pay closer to her price.  If Alice rejects this, he's close enough to her price that he might be willing to buy from John in the final round.  This counteroffer is Bob's last chance to potentially get a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than Bob's maximum budget.  While there's one more round, it's unlikely Alice will lower her price enough to make it worthwhile. This is a good opportunity for Bob to take the safe route and buy from John.  Although he doesn't get the absolute lowest price, he's guaranteed to get the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not result in a better deal."
