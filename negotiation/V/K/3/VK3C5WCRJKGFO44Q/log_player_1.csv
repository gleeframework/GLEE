"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me, would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $7,250 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $8,000.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,625? I think that's a fair compromise, and it's a good price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 7625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I appreciate that. I'd be willing to do $7,400.  That's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $7,400 is a tempting offer, I've only got four rounds left.  If Bob continues to reject my counteroffers, I risk losing out on a sale to John, who is guaranteed to buy it for $8,000.  It's better to secure the guaranteed sale now and avoid the risk of a lower price."
