"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good negotiation tactic to start with an ambitious offer. This gives you room to negotiate down and still achieve a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""potential,""  you subtly justify the high asking price without explicitly revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and indicates your willingness to have a conversation, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than John's, but we have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. We're still in the early stages of the negotiation, and walking away now would be premature."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,400,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product goes beyond that.  Would you consider $1,700,000?  This price reflects the inherent worth and potential I see in its application for your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer to show we're taking his input seriously.
* **Downward Movement:**  We decrease our asking price, but not drastically. This signals flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Value Reiteration:** We subtly shift the focus back to the product's value proposition, specifically mentioning ""your specific needs"" to make the offer more compelling.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're aiming to meet somewhere in the middle between Bob's offer and our desired price, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,700,000 is justified. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's offer. While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob has signaled this is his ceiling (""I don't think I can go any higher"").  Accepting now secures the $1,500,000 and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
