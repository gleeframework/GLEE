Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference again. How about $1,065,000? I think this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.

At $1,065,000, we're getting a significant discount from Alice's starting price and John's fallback offer.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the potential savings likely aren't worth the risk of Alice walking away or the time it would take to get a lower offer."
