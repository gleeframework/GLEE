* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,350,000, while John wants $1,500,000.
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **You still get a good deal:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so you're getting it for $350,000 more than its value to her, which is still a decent deal."
