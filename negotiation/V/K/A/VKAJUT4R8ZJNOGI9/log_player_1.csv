{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $10,000 is higher than the $8,000 Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:**  I'm willing to go down to $12,000, so I have room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear offer:**  It's straightforward and easy for Bob to understand.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Start the negotiation strong:**  By offering a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm showing that I'm confident in the value of my product.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product for a low price.
* **Protect my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000.

However, I'll be prepared to counter Bob's offer if necessary, and I'll always keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as a safety net."
