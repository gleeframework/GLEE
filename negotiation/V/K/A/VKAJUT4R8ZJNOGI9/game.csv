"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  That's a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit over budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $8,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'll come down to $9,500, and I hope you'll agree to that.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,5,
