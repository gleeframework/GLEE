Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Profitable:** This price is still a significant profit over my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's initial offer.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time, and John's offer is guaranteed. However, the potential for an extra $100,000 outweighs a few more rounds of negotiation. 
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating he's serious about the purchase."
