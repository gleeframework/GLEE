Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
This offer is calculated with the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** $1,500,000
* **John's value:** $1,000,000
* **My minimum acceptable value:** $1,000,000

By offering $1,400,000, I'm aiming for a compromise that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:** He gets a $100,000 discount on his perceived value.
* **Profitable for me:** I earn $400,000 more than my minimum acceptable value.

This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a significantly better price than selling to John."
