"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $125 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You want to save as much money as possible, and $125 is still more than you want to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $125 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $105?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115,  would you be interested in that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While you'd prefer to pay even less, Alice has come down in price and $115 is still within your budget.  Accepting the offer means you can get the product without having to go through more rounds of negotiation or paying the higher price from John."
