"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. Can you meet me at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this price point?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion, but $975,000 is still significantly below my expectations.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it's a fair compromise. I'm confident you'll see the value in accepting this offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
