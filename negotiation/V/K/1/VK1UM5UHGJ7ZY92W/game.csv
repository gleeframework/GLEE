"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  The product looks great, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $100. Our product is valued at $120 by you, which already represents a fair deal. To ensure both parties benefit from this transaction, I would like to propose a price of $125. This price respects the value you see in the product while allowing us to achieve a reasonable profit. I look forward to your response.",125.0,Alice,3,
