"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that indicates I'm open to negotiation, making Bob feel like he has some control. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to see if I can get Bob to accept a price closer to my value. If he rejects, I'll continue to adjust my offer based on his counteroffers while also considering my fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my value, $9,000 is still significantly less than what I'd like to get for the product.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a better price in the next round.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm still keeping John as a backup option, but I'm optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $11,000. This takes into account the value of the product for you, while still allowing me to get a fair price.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm bridging the gap between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling my willingness to compromise.
* **Value-based reasoning:**  I'm reiterating the value proposition of the product for Bob to justify my counteroffer.
* **Open-ended invitation:**  My message encourages further dialogue and negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me. By taking a more flexible approach, I hope to incentivize Bob to come up on his offer while maintaining my own leverage.  I'm still watching my clock, but I'm feeling optimistic about getting a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a price closer to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my desired price:**  $10,000 is still significantly below my target price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation room:** We've made progress, but there's still some wiggle room for Bob to come up on his offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially push for a better price. 

**Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer, but this time, I'll be more cautious. I'll aim for a price closer to $11,000 again, but I'll be prepared to accept a slightly lower price if necessary. I'm keeping John as a backup option, but I'm still hoping to reach a deal with Bob.  With fewer rounds left, I need to start thinking more strategically about closing a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  $10,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  How about $10,500?  This would allow me to get a good price while still giving you a great deal on this valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the price by a smaller amount this time, showing flexibility while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to Bob, making him feel like he's still getting a good deal.
* **Direct Question:** I'm directly asking for his decision to move the negotiation forward. 

**Strategy:**

With fewer rounds left, I'm taking a more aggressive approach to getting closer to my target. I'm trying to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and ensuring a deal gets done. I'm still monitoring my backup option with John, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** $9,800 is closer to my value, but it's still significantly less than my desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation window closing:** We're reaching the halfway point of our negotiations, and I need to be more strategic. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the final rounds of negotiations and potentially push for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer again, but this time, I'll be even more cautious. I'll aim for a price closer to $10,000, but I'll be prepared to accept a slightly lower price if necessary. I'm still keeping John as a backup option, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time. I'm determined to get a price that's closer to my value, but I'm also aware that I might have to settle for less than I originally wanted."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $9,800 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,200.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer, demonstrating a commitment to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using language that encourages Bob to close the deal, highlighting the urgency of reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

With only a few rounds remaining, I'm taking a more direct approach. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my value, while still being reasonable for Bob. I'm hoping that this compromise will be enough to entice Bob to accept the deal. However, I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary.  I need to find the right balance between pushing for a higher price and securing a deal before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the pressure is on to make a decision. 
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my desired price, and I'm not confident I can negotiate a significantly higher price in the next round.
* **John is a secure option:** Selling to John guarantees me the full $15,000, which is much closer to my value.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where I need to prioritize a guaranteed profit over continuing to negotiate with Bob. While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and ending up with nothing is too great. Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point, ensuring I maximize my earnings."
