"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Let me know if that's something we can work with.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $11,000. This takes into account the value of the product for you, while still allowing me to get a fair price.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a price closer to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  $10,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  How about $10,500?  This would allow me to get a good price while still giving you a great deal on this valuable product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $9,800 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,200.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to close this deal.  What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,8,
