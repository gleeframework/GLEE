"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum value of $150. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can try to get a better price from Alice. 
* **Rejecting the offer doesn't mean you won't buy from Alice.**  You can still negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $135 is less than your maximum of $150.
* **It's a good compromise.** You've lowered the price from her initial $140, and she's come down from her previous counteroffer of $135.
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk is too high.**  If you reject the offer and she doesn't budge, you'll have to pay John's $150."
