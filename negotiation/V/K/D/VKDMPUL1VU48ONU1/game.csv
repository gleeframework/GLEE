"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that starting price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1200000.0
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hello again Alice.  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1200000.0
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $1,000,000 for this, but that's as high as I can go.",1000000.0,Bob,6,,

"I think we're very close, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a significant amount for this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than $1,200,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'm willing to sell it to you at that price.",1200000.0,Alice,7,,
