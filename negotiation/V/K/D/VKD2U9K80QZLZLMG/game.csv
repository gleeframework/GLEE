"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $130. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted rate. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we're getting close to a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $122.50. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision if you accept this offer.",122.5,Bob,6,
