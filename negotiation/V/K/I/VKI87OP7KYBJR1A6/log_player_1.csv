Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Here's why I chose this price:

* **It's higher than my minimum:** $1,400,000 is above my minimum of $1,200,000, so I'm guaranteed to make a profit.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $1,400,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000). This gives Bob a good incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counter-offers, we have room to negotiate before reaching my minimum.

By offering this price, I'm balancing my desire for a high profit with the need to incentivize Bob to accept the offer."
