"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a steal for its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Opening with a high price allows for more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Expressing value:** Highlighting the product's value and potential gives Bob an incentive to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message shows willingness to negotiate, keeping the door open for a deal.

**Important:**  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. The success hinges on Bob's perception of the product's value and his willingness to negotiate.  It's also important to remember that you can always accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob stall or become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's aim for $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets your minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is the minimum you're willing to accept. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, or a drawn-out process, potentially wasting valuable time.
* **Opportunity cost:** There's no guarantee that a counteroffer from Bob would result in a higher price. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting Bob's offer provides a guaranteed sale at your minimum price. 

**In this situation, the benefits of a quick and secure sale outweigh the potential gains from further negotiation.**"
