Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum value, showing Bob you're serious about selling but also leaving room for negotiation. It's also closer to your ideal price of $1,000,000. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  Starting high gives you more bargaining power.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will indicate his level of desire and how willing he is to negotiate.
* **Maintain John as a backup:** You can always sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $800,000.  While it's tempting to accept and close the deal quickly, rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to try to get closer to my target price. 

Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but I believe I can do better with Bob.  By rejecting his initial counteroffer, I can show him that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my minimum value of $800,000 and Bob's initial offer of $700,000. 
* **Signal willingness to negotiate:** This shows Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'm still firm on my minimum price.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  I'm still aware of John's offer of $800,000 and can use it as a bargaining chip if needed. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a reasonable price:**  $850,000 is a good compromise that's closer to my target.
* **Encourage further negotiation:**  This approach allows me to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $650,000 is far below my minimum value of $800,000. At this point, it seems clear that Bob is not willing to meet my expectations. 

While it's always tempting to try to continue negotiating, I've already made several concessions and Bob has shown he's not willing to budge.  It's in my best interest to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed offer from John. 

Selling to John for $800,000 ensures I get a fair price and avoids further, potentially fruitless, negotiations with Bob."
