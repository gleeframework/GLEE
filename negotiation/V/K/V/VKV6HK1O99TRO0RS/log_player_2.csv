"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal, as I know it's something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We are starting with a counter offer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This tactic might seem aggressive, but it leaves us room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $70 is too low for me.  Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further.  We'll counter with a price closer to her value but still within our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

We are inching closer to a price that might be acceptable to both parties.  This offer shows Alice we are willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I could go as low as $82, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for both of us. Alice is signaling this is her lowest price, and it's close enough to her value that she's likely to accept. Accepting now prevents the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
