"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  I think that's still a great value for you, considering how much it's worth to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
