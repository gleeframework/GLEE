{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you are willing to negotiate, which could encourage Bob to accept or make a counteroffer.  I'm keeping the price higher than what I'd sell to John because I want to get the best price possible from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  I think that's still a great value for you, considering how much it's worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
