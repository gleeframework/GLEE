Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 allows room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can always decrease the price, getting closer to your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Value Proposition:** While the message doesn't explicitly mention why the product is worth $150, the phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""highly valuable"" subtly imply that the price reflects additional value beyond Bob's perceived $100.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while still leaving open the possibility of a successful sale to Bob."
