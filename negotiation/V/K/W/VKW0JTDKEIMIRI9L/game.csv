"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming closer, Alice. $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $7,000? That's a significant step from my initial offer, and it would allow me to get the product while staying within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
