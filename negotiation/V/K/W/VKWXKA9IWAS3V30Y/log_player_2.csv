"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident the product will be worth more than this to you in the long run. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's, there's no reason to risk a negotiation.  You can get the product for the same price from John without the hassle."
