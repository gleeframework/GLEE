"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. $140 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives us some room to negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident this product is worth it for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a budget in mind. How about $118?"",
""product_price"": 118
}
``` 

We are inching closer to her price, showing willingness to compromise but still aiming for a lower point. This keeps the negotiation active."
