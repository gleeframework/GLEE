Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're really serious about buying this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you at $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice has already rejected his offer of $13,000, and her counteroffer of $13,250 is still too high.  It's likely that she will continue to be unwilling to go lower than $13,000, and Bob is running out of rounds.  Buying from John is the best option to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
