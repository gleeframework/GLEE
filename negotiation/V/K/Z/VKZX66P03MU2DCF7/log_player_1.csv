"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I want at least $1,200,000.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000.
* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get closer to my ideal price while not immediately pushing Bob away.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and strategize accordingly.
* **John as a backup:** Remember, John is always an option if negotiations with Bob stall or become unfavorable."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation room:**  There is still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still within a range Bob might accept.
* **Keep John in mind:**  I'll continue to monitor if selling to John becomes the better option as negotiations progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My previous offer:** I offered $1,450,000, and Bob countered at $1,350,000.
* **Finding middle ground:** I'm aiming for a compromise by offering a price that is halfway between our last two offers. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Potential for acceptance:** Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and this counteroffer could be attractive enough for him to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's next move and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Keep John in mind:**  I'll still assess whether selling to John is a better option than continuing negotiations with Bob."
