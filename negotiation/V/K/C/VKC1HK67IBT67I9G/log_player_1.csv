"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that attempts to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation, but it's above his perceived value, ensuring I'm not giving away too much in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1250000 is the absolute maximum I can go. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still significantly below what I consider fair.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll need to see a higher offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still too far from what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget and my need for a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1275000 is the absolute maximum I can go. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a price that I'm comfortable with.  I've already come down significantly from my initial asking price, and Bob doesn't seem willing to budge much further.  To avoid losing more time and potentially getting stuck with a much lower price, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
