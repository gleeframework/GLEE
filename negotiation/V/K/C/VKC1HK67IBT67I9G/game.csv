"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $1300000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1250000 is the absolute maximum I can go. Can you consider my offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still too far from what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget and my need for a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
