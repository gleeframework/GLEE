"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and features, it's worth $120 to me. Considering its value to you might be around $100, I'm willing to negotiate. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $110? This would be a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a price slightly above its perceived value to you.",110.0,Alice,1,
