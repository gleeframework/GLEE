Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I am only able to commit to a budget of $12,000 for this purchase.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I still can't go beyond $12,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge above $12,000. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, it's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on.  There's no point in wasting more rounds when I can secure my minimum acceptable price right now."
