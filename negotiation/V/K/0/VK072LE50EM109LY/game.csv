"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the product's potential.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
