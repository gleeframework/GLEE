"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You're saving $1,000 compared to buying from John, but there's room for a better deal.
* **Rejecting allows negotiation.** By rejecting, you signal to Alice that you're willing to walk away, putting pressure on her to potentially lower her price. 
* **Counteroffer is the next step.** You'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $11,250. This price takes into account your desired price of $10,500, but also ensures I'm getting a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice has come down slightly.** Her offer is now $11,250, which is closer to your desired price of $10,500.
* **It's a good compromise.** You're saving $750 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the potential gains are smaller.
* **Time is a factor.** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal with Alice entirely.  The $750 savings is a worthwhile compromise for the certainty of a deal."
