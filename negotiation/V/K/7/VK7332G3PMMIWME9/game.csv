"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $750,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $725,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775,000. I think this product is worth every penny of that price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering you a deal for $787,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",787500.0,Alice,5,
