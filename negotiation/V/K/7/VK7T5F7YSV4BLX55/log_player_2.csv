Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also sets a clear expectation that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between my budget and Alice's desired price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above my budget. While it's closer, I'm still not willing to pay more than $10,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better price, and I want to keep the pressure on Alice to meet my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay my maximum price of $10,000.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John. I'm hoping Alice recognizes that I'm serious and accepts this offer."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget and I'm not willing to budge any further. At this point, I believe I've made a reasonable attempt to negotiate and have reached my limit. It's better to buy from John and get the product for my desired price."
