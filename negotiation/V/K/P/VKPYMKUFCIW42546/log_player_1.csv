This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message that acknowledges Bob's potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
