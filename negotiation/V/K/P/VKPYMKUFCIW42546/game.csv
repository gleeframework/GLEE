"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $10500?  This is a great price for a product that will bring you significant value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9500.  I'm very interested in this product and hope we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're getting close.  How about we meet at $10000?  I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go any lower than that.  Let's close this deal and get you this great product!",10000.0,Alice,5,
