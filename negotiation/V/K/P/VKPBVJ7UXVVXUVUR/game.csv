"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I believe reflects the product's true value. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 to start.  I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, and I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
