"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I believe reflects the product's true value. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 to start.  I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, and I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of pushing her further. You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, which is within your budget."
