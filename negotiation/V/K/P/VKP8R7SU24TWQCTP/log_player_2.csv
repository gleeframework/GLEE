{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $900,000 is above your budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $700,000. This is a bold move, but it signals my seriousness about negotiating and my willingness to pay less than Alice's initial offer. It also gives us some room to maneuver in future rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I still believe the product is worth less than Alice's current offer. It's a middle ground that might encourage Alice to come down further."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still above my budget, but we're getting closer. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a price closer to my target.  I'm also getting concerned about the number of rounds remaining - if we don't make progress soon, I might have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $775,000. This is a small increase, showing Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but it's still significantly lower than her last offer. With only 4 rounds left, I need to start pushing for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is exactly what John is selling it for.  This is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the product by continuing to negotiate. With only three rounds left, the odds of getting a better price are low, and I'm satisfied with this price."
