Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being closer to your budget. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you've got another option at $1,000,000, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000, but I'll offer you a compromise. I'll meet you at $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her ""final offer"" of $975,000 is still higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and it's not worth risking a worse deal when you have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000."
