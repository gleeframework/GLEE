"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my original price. How about $13000? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it leaves some room for negotiation.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I see we're getting closer. While $12500 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to consider $13500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $13500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13500 and $12000. How about we try $12000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about $12750? This is a good midpoint between our current offers, and it shows I'm truly committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.",12750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $12750 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer of $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",12000.0,Bob,8,
