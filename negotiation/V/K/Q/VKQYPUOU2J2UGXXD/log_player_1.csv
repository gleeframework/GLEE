"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm creating some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to reach a price that is closer to my minimum value of $15,000. However, I'm also willing to accept John's offer of $15,000 at any point if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. While I could accept it and secure a sale, it's not a desirable outcome for me.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have 8 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can secure a better price.  I'll use this rejection as an opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my original price. How about $13,000? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it leaves some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone respectful and focusing on finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm emphasizing that my offer is still a good deal for Bob.

**Strategy:**

By offering $13,000, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to accept his significantly lower price. I'm aiming to find a middle ground where we can both be satisfied. This strategy allows me to remain in control of the negotiation and continue working towards my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to get.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. We're approaching the middle ground, and I believe I can still push for a higher price. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I see we're getting closer. While $12,500 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $13,500, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to meet halfway, but still not giving up on my goal of a higher price. 
* **Message:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone, highlighting the compromise my offer represents and reminding Bob of the product's value.

**Strategy:**

By offering $13,500, I'm pushing Bob to accept a price closer to my desired outcome. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm using this counteroffer to maintain control and demonstrate that I'm willing to find a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $13500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13500 and $12000. How about we try $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is tempting as it is close to Bob's perceived value, I'm still not at my minimum value of $15,000.  I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. My goal is to secure a price as close to $15,000 as possible, and I'm not willing to give up yet.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can reach a more desirable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about $12,750? This is a good midpoint between our current offers, and it shows I'm truly committed to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  My counteroffer of $12,750 is a small increase from Bob's last offer.  This demonstrates I'm willing to be flexible but still not willing to accept a price significantly below my minimum value.
* **Message:**  I'm continuing with a respectful and collaborative tone, highlighting the compromise my offer represents and reminding Bob of my commitment to a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

By offering $12,750, I'm pushing Bob towards a price closer to my minimum value while still showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm aiming to close the gap quickly and secure a price that is both fair and acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $12750 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer of $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I'm close to reaching a deal, it's not a satisfactory outcome for me.  I'm confident that John will pay my minimum asking price.

**Strategy:**

Since Bob's offer is not acceptable to me, and I'm running out of negotiation rounds, I will choose to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
