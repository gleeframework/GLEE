"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1000000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I can offer you a compromise at $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1400000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1200000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
