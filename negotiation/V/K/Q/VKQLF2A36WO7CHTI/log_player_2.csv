Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I can offer you a compromise at $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.

While $1,400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $1300000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.

Alice is still above your budget, and you've already made a counteroffer.  At this point, it's probably best to buy from John to avoid further negotiation."
