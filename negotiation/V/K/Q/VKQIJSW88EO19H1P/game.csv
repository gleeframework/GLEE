"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the value I bring to the table while acknowledging your interest. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I need to stay within my limits. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",975000.0,Bob,6,
