Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I do see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
