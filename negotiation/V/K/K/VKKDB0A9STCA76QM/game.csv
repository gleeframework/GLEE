"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,750, but that's my final offer.  This is a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product at a price that's still significantly lower than what it's worth to you.",11750.0,Alice,5,
