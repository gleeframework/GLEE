Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than $1,000,000, so this is a good start.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $1,500,000 value, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **It's enticing:** $1,400,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to him.

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves you with less profit.  There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

You'll send a counteroffer to Bob. Aim for a price that's higher than $1,100,000 but still lower than your initial offer. This will show Bob you're willing to negotiate but also that you value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000).
* **Still Profitable:** $1,250,000 is still a good profit for you, and it shows Bob you're willing to negotiate but also that you value the product.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** By offering a price closer to Bob's offer, you're increasing the likelihood he'll accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I can do $1,150,000.  Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to your minimum, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for you. There's still some wiggle room, and you can likely get a better price with another counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's higher than his latest offer but still lower than your previous counteroffer.  This shows him you're serious about negotiating but also that you still value the product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll let us finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,150,000). It shows him you're willing to meet him halfway.
* **Still Profitable:**  $1,200,000 is still above your minimum and a good profit for you.
* **Finality:**  This offer is phrased to encourage Bob to accept. It emphasizes fairness and finalizing the deal."
