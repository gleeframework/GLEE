,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to be closer to $95 to make this work.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and settle at $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
