"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is a good starting point, but it's still above my target price. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $650,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $675,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price.  While I'd prefer to get it even lower,  $675,000 is a good deal and within my budget.  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and ending up with a worse outcome or having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
