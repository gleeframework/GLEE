# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe you'll be happy with the deal.

Alice's offer:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $8,500. Since you can buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses in the negotiation with Alice and go with the guaranteed lower price."
