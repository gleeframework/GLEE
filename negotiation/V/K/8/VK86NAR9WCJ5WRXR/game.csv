"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. Would it be possible to negotiate a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value this product highly, I'm willing to work with you. I can't go as low as $1200000, but I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1350000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's fair given the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
