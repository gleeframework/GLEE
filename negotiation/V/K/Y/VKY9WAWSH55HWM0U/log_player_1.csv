Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be a great value for you at $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we start with a price closer to our minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering the product at $140 still gives us a significant profit margin even if Bob manages to negotiate the price down a little. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a safety net with John who will buy the product at our minimum price. This allows us to be more firm in our negotiation with Bob.

By starting the negotiation higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's offer, we maximize our chances of getting the best possible price."
