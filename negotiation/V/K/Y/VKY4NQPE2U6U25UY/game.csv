"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I have to make a profit, and $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $16,500 to feel comfortable. Can you consider that?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I can offer it to you for $16,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16750.0,Alice,5,
