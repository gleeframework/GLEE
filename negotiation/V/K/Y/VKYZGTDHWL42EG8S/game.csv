"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you about this. I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm offering it at a starting price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for your business.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,250,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my ability to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it's a more than fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise and a significant step closer to our agreement.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
