{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,250,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my ability to pay."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This feels like a fair compromise.
