"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go down to $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $18000. This is as low as I can go, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $18000, which would be $17000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $17000?",17000.0,Bob,6,
