Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with $1,075,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We are still making progress in negotiating a higher price. Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, suggesting he's willing to pay more. Accepting $1,075,000 now would leave potential profit on the table."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've carefully considered your offers and am willing to pay $1,085,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,085,000 is quite close to our desired outcome. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit of $85,000 over our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
