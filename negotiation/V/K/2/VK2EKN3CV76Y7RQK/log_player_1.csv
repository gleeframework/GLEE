Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob still finds it worthwhile to buy. 

Here's why:

* **For me:** This price is significantly higher than what I would get from John, allowing me to make more profit.
* **For Bob:**  He's still getting a good deal, as the product is worth $100 to him, so he's saving $5.

This strategy aims to strike a good balance between my desire for a high price and the need to make sure Bob finds the deal appealing enough to accept."
