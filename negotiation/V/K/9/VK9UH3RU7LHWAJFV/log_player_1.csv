Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept. Here's why:

* **For you:**  You're earning $150,000 more than selling to John.
* **For Bob:** He's getting the product for $50,000 less than its value to him.

This approach gives Bob a good deal while still securing a significant profit for you."
