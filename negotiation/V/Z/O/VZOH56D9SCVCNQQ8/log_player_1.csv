"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($80). This allows for room to negotiate. 
* **Setting the Tone:** I'm highlighting the product's value to me to create a sense of urgency and potentially make Bob feel like he's getting a deal even if he negotiates down.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended to encourage Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter-Offer:** Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Since Bob is interested, I believe there's room for him to increase his offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage in the negotiation and potentially encourage him to make a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm looking for a bit closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping from $120 to $110, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Interest:** I emphasize Bob's interest to motivate him to move closer to my price.
* **Setting a Clear Target:**  I've made my desired price point clear, making the negotiation more straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Close to Deal:** We are getting close to a deal, and I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage and show that I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $102.50 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer ($110) and Bob's current offer ($95). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I emphasize the ""split the difference"" aspect to make it seem like a fair and mutually beneficial solution.
* **Pushing for a Deal:** This offer is just above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a reasonable step closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already at round 6, and I'm running out of time to reach a profitable deal with Bob.
* **Falling Short of Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John is offering me a guaranteed $100, which is my minimum and a safe bet compared to continuing with Bob.

At this point, it's wiser to accept John's offer and secure a known profit than risk further negotiation with Bob, who is unlikely to meet my minimum."
