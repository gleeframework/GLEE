{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than my minimum price of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's attractive enough to entice Bob, while still allowing me to potentially earn a higher price.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less room for me to profit. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand it's a bit lower than my initial proposal, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm offering $12,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $11,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a bit higher price. I'm not sure how much more I can get out of Bob, but I'm willing to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures we both walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a good compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest one.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope Bob will accept.  If he doesn't, I'll have to consider selling to John for the lower price."
