"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand it's a bit lower than my initial proposal, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
