"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny for you.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,900000.0
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least break even.  How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price for a product that will generate significant returns for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,950000.0
"I understand that you need to break even, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000? I'm confident that this price will be a good compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a little below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,980000.0
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $980,000? I think this price is a reasonable compromise that works for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,,
