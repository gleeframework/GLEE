"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to consider purchasing at $9500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I know you'll get from this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10500, which is a fair price considering my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'd like to propose a slight compromise. I'll sell it to you for $10750. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $10250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to complete the purchase.  I'm hoping you can accept this final offer.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10500, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's worth $500. This way, you'll get the product and some extra benefits that will make it even more valuable to you. The total price will still be $10500, but I think you'll find it's a great deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
