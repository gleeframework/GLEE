"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our target price.  Buying from John right away would be settling for the maximum price without even trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below both Alice's offer and our maximum budget. 
* **Polite and Open:** We keep the tone positive to encourage continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Target:** Alice's offer of $12,000 matches our maximum budget. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** There's no guarantee we can negotiate a lower price, and continuing the negotiation risks either a higher final price or losing the deal altogether. 
* **John's Offer:**  Since John's offer is also $12,000, there's no advantage to switching to him at this point. 

Accepting Alice's offer secures us the product at the best possible price we've seen."
