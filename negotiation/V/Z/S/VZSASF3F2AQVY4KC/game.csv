"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't accept $1200000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $1800000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so how about $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $1700000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your original offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1600000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1600000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $1900000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1900000.0,Alice,7,

"I've made it clear that $1600000 is my maximum offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere. I'm willing to walk away from the deal.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
