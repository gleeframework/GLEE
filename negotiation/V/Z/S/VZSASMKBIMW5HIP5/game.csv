"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm starting at $200, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the negotiation. However, $200 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $150? That gives us both a good deal.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $125.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  What do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $130. This is getting close to my limit, but I think it's fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $135 for the product.  What do you think?",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $132. Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",132.0,Bob,8,
