"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true value and potential.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 to make a deal.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $725,000?  That's a significant move on my part.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, $725,000 is a significant move. Let's land on $850,000 and close the deal. This product will generate significant returns for you, and I want to ensure we find a price point we both feel good about.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up slightly, but I can't do $850,000. My absolute best offer is $775,000. If you can meet me there, we have a deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
