"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a good compromise and allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
