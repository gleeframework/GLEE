Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my price range. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get closer to your desired price while staying within my budget.  What do you think?

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's clear further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price I find acceptable. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
