"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what makes sense for you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my price range. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get closer to your desired price while staying within my budget.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
