Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good idea to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies that the product is worth the higher price. 
* **Alternative:** Highlighting that Bob is getting a pre-public listing opportunity creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency.
* **Fallback:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John."
