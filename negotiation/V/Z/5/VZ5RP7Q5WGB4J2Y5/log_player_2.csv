"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is too high.  You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $15,000. By rejecting this offer, you might encourage Alice to propose a lower price."
