"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You can save at least $3,000 compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, which would be $11,000. Would you be interested in that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  While there's room for further negotiation, it's likely Alice won't go much lower. Accepting this offer saves Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John."
