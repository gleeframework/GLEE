Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might make him feel like there's no room for negotiation and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob."
