Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $7,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is as low as I can go, considering its value to me is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

This is a good time to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling a firm limit:** She's explicitly stated this is as low as she'll go. 
* **The price is reasonable:** $8,200 is significantly less than your $12,000 maximum and a decent savings.
* **Further negotiation is risky:** You might not get a better offer from Alice and could risk pushing her away entirely."
