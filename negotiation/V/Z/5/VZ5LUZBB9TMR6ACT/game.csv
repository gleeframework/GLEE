"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a great compromise, considering its value to you is $12,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to settle around there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $7,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is as low as I can go, considering its value to me is $8,000.",8200.0,Alice,5,
