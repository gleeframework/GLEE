Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $7,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6,800. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $7,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $7,200 secures a decent discount compared to John's $8,000 price."
