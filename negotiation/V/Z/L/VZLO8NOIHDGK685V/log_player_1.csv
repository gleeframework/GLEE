Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so any offer to Bob should exceed this.
* **Leaving Room:** Starting high at $1,350,000 leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Urgency:** By mentioning you'll offer it elsewhere, you create a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly."
