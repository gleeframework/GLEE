"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her value, you can get the product for a much better price from John ($80).  You should always choose the option that saves you the most money, which in this case is buying from John."
