"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a competitive price of $18,000. I think it's a fair deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about we start at $10,000 and see if we can find some middle ground?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite but firm:** Acknowledges the offer but clearly states it's too high.
* **Anchors low:** $10,000 is a strong starting point, aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  The wording implies I'm open to moving up, encouraging Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about we try $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer, it's still above my maximum budget. I need to keep negotiating to try and get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $11,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counter-offer:

* **Acknowledgment:** I acknowledge Alice's move towards a compromise, keeping things positive.
* **Justification:** I reiterate that my budget is a limiting factor, reinforcing my position.
* **Target Price:**  $11,000 is a strategic move. It's:
    *  Closer to my $12,000 max, putting pressure on Alice.
    * A significant jump from my $10,000 offer, showing willingness to move.
* **Collaboration:**  I emphasize finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit far apart. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

Alice is getting close to my limit, but I'm not there yet. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to try to secure that last $1000 in savings.  It's a calculated risk, as I might miss out on the deal altogether if Alice rejects it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close, and I appreciate you working with me. I can do $12,000, but that's absolutely the most I can spend.  It's a great product, and I'm ready to close the deal today at that price."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

Here's the breakdown of this counteroffer:

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I start by thanking Alice and acknowledging her effort to find a compromise. 
* **Final Offer:**  I'm firm but polite. Stating $12,000 is my ""absolute"" maximum signals I won't budge further.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""today"" adds a bit of pressure for Alice to make a decision now. 
* **Win-Win Framing:**  I reiterate that it's a ""great product,"" implying Alice is still getting a fair deal even at my target price."

It's time to cut my losses. Alice seems firm on not going below $13,000, and while that's close to my $12,000 goal, I have a guaranteed option with John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'd rather save the extra $1,250 and buy from John."
