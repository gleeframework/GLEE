"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $15,000 for the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $16,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close the deal.",16250.0,Bob,4,
