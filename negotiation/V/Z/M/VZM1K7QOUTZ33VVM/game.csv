"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to work within your budget, but $9,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to try to meet you in the middle again. How about we go with $9,750? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.",9750.0,Bob,4,
