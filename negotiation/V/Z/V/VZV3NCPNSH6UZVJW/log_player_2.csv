"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this valuable product, which is worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is significantly above her product valuation ($12,000 vs. $10,000). While it's below your maximum, there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** By countering at $11,000, we're aiming to bring the price closer to Alice's valuation and significantly lower than our maximum budget.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  Offering to ""meet in the middle"" can make the counteroffer seem more appealing and less like a hard bargain. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer leaves space for further negotiation if Alice rejects it. We can still go up a bit while staying well below our $15,000 limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12,500, which is still a great deal considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is budging slightly, but she's still aiming for a price well above her valuation.  While $12,500 is closer to our maximum, we haven't reached a point where accepting is the best option. There's likely still room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're showing Alice we're willing to move, but only in smaller increments. This signals that we're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Staying Below John's Offer:** At $11,500, we're still well below our alternative option with John, maintaining leverage in the negotiation.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help us gauge how much further Alice is willing to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached a Stalemate:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer by stating she can't go lower without losing money. While she might be bluffing slightly, further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant movement. 
* **Saving is Good:** Accepting at $12,000 still gives us a $3,000 saving compared to John's offer.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing could lead to Alice walking away, forcing us to buy from John at the higher price. It's better to secure a good deal now."
