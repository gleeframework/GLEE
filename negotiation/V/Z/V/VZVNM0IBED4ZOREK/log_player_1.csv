Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer of $142 is getting closer to my minimum. However, I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer. John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is more than my minimum and a safe bet."
