"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $12000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $15000. Let's meet in the middle. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,4,
