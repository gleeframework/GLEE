Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $90.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $85. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'm not thrilled about accepting his offer, but I'm also not willing to sell it to him for less than $80. Let's see...

I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer. I'll send him a counteroffer that's higher than his offer but still lower than my minimum price. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $87.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. Since he offered $85, I'll increase the price by a small amount to $87. This is still lower than the $100 that the product is worth to him, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle.
