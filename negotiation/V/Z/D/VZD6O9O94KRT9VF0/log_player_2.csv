You should reject Alice's offer.  It's too high for your budget. You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still leaves room for profit for you.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, you can still try to get a better price. Reject her offer and counter-offer again, aiming for a price closer to your target of $800,000."
