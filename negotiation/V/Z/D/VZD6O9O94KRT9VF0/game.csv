"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this item. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still leaves room for profit for you.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and closer to my budget. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.",900000.0,Bob,4,
