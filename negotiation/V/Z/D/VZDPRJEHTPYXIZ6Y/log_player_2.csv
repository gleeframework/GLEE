"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that could significantly benefit your business. I believe its worth is much higher than $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm open to negotiating a fair price that reflects its true value. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1500000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While Alice claims the product is worth more, Bob doesn't know the actual value and doesn't want to risk overpaying. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for his maximum acceptable price."
