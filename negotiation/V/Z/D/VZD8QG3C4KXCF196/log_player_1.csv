"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This sets a high bar for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  This sets the tone for a more profitable negotiation.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer is above Bob's valuation, allowing for potential compromise.
* **Alternative option:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's a good chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** My goal is to maximize my earnings, and $1,200,000 doesn't meet that goal.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer.
* **Alternative:** I have the option of selling to John, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing a willingness to compromise, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility without jeopardizing my desired profit margin.

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Profit margin:**  $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Time:** With 7 rounds remaining, there's still time for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I still have several rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John remains a viable option.

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to compromise my minimum price point just yet.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for further negotiation, and I can explore more strategies in the following rounds.
* **Alternative:** Selling to John is always an option, giving me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm now offering the product at my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates a strong commitment to closing the deal while still securing my desired profit.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum acceptable price:** I'm not willing to go lower than $1,500,000.
* **Strong commitment:**  This offer signals that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to budge further.
* **Time pressure:** We are nearing the middle of the negotiation, and the opportunity cost of further negotiation is increasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We're nearing the end of the negotiation with only 4 rounds remaining, and there's a high chance that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time constraint:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of failing to reach an agreement increases significantly.
* **Opportunity cost:**  The opportunity cost of continuing to negotiate with Bob is high, considering John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
