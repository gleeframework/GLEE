``` 

This offer starts at a high price, but it's still lower than the product's value to Bob. It allows for negotiation space while still securing a profitable deal for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still lower than Alice's minimum price of $1,200,000. Alice can do better by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000? It seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
