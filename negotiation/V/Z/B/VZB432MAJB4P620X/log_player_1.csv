I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. With only 2 rounds left, I'm going to try one more time to negotiate with Bob. If I don't get a better offer, I will have to sell to John."

This is the final round.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Even though it's only slightly above my minimum, it's better than selling to John for $10,000.  I've run out of time to negotiate further, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
