"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested, as he values the product at $800,000.  This gives me a good starting point for a potential win-win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $700,000 is still a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway. $850,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's a significant step closer to what he offered. I'm hoping this will be more appealing than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm still hoping to secure a higher price, and I believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us both to our goals. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm making a final push for my asking price.  $800,000 is my absolute minimum, and it's also the price John is willing to pay.  This offers a good compromise and a win-win for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, we're running out of rounds.  $775,000 is a good price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. I'm going to sell to John for $800,000, which is my minimum and ensures I get a decent profit."
