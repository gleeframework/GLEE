"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get a good deal. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell it to you for $9,250. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $8,750?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9125.0,Alice,5,
