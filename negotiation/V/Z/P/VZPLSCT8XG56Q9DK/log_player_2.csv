# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from Alice, and it's worth less to him than to her, so there's room for negotiation.  He's better off trying to get a better price before buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get a good deal. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell it to you for $9,250. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still better off trying to get a lower price, as he's already offered $8,500 and knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. There's still room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $9,125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's a good deal for him, as he's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is significantly lower. He's already pushed the price down a lot.  Further negotiation might get the price down slightly, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to buy from John at a much higher price."
