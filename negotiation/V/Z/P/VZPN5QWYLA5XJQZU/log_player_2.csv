"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's always best to start by rejecting an initial offer that is too high and initiating a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $950,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd be willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still above your budget, but it's getting closer.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a lower price.  Rejecting this offer will give you the opportunity to counteroffer and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is your maximum offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above your budget, and while she has stated it is a final compromise, there's no guarantee she won't counteroffer again.  You've already made a serious offer at your maximum budget, and it seems Alice is unwilling to budge. It's in your best interest to purchase from John for $800,000 to ensure you get the product within your budget and avoid further negotiation."
