Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I know this is a significant investment, but I truly believe it's a bargain for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Creating Urgency:** By setting a high initial price and slightly lowering it, you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly before you change your mind or someone else buys it. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the message implies this is your best offer, it leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested. If he does, you can gracefully decline or offer a minuscule discount.

It's crucial to remember that Bob has no knowledge of your deal with John. Your messaging should focus on the product's value and subtly imply it's in high demand."
