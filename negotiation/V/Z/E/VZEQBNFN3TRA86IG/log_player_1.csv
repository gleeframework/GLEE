{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than your minimum but still lower than the product's value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm a bit on a tight budget, and I'd love to get a better deal on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $105?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and gives you a good deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $100. That way, we can both come out happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with what I could get from John. Accepting his offer ensures I don't lose time on further negotiation and secure a sale."
