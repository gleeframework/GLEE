"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's less than what the product is worth to him, he can get it for a lower price from John."
