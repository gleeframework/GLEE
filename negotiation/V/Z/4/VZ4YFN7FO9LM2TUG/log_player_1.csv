Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to offer it above his valuation but below your minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you're well above your minimum.
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:** The message aims to project confidence in the offer and highlight the product's value to Bob, potentially increasing his willingness to pay.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just one possible approach. A more aggressive strategy could involve a higher initial offer. 
* Gauge Bob's interest and adjust accordingly if necessary. 
* The key is to balance maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and going with your backup option (John)."
