Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000), but it gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I want to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $10,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still protecting my value. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob's initial offer and my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm confident I can find a better deal in the future, but taking this offer now minimizes risk and gets me closer to my goal. It's also worth noting that continuing to negotiate could drag on and potentially lead to a worse outcome."
