Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000, which reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice still comes out ahead compared to selling to John directly.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob without revealing Alice's minimum acceptable price.  

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal for Alice."
