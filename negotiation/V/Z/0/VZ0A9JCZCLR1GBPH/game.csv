"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work. It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $780,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  However, I'm willing to go down to $820,000.  This gives you a fair price, and it gets me closer to my goal. Let's make this deal happen!",820000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the price I was thinking of all along. Can we make it work at this price?",800000.0,Bob,6,
