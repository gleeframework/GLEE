Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair and lucrative offer considering the return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still staying significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's value and potential return on investment justifies the high price and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net, ensuring I don't lose out completely if Bob rejects the offer."
