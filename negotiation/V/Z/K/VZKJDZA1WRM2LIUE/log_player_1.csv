Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before it hits the open market.  Given its unique value, I'm offering it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $50,000 discount from its true value to him.
    * I make a $50,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Exclusivity:**  The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing adds a sense of urgency and value for Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
