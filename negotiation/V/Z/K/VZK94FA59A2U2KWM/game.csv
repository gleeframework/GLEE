"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you letting me know the value it holds to you. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, and I'd be happy to buy it for $90. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I am proposing to sell the product for $105. I hope this aligns better with your budget. If not, please feel free to make another counteroffer.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. Let's split the difference and meet at $100. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
