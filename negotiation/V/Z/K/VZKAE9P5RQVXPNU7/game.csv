"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my own valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,025,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you see in the product. ",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest. Let's see if we can close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
