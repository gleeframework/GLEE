"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, your initial offer is unfortunately outside my budget. My maximum price for this product is $800000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the feedback, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
