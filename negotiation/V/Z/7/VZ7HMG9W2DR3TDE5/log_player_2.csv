"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. You're only willing to spend a maximum of $800,000, and her initial offer is $1,200,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, your initial offer is unfortunately outside my budget. My maximum price for this product is $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the feedback, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. There's no guarantee she'll come down further, and continuing to negotiate risks wasting time and potentially reaching a stalemate.  It's more efficient to take John's offer, which meets your budget and provides a guaranteed purchase."
