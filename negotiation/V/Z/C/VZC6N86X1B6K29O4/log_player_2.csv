"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John, even though it's more expensive, as it's still within your budget."
