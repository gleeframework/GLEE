"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is fair, you can get the product from John for the same price.  There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer, so you should reject it and buy from John."
