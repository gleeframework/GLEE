Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations significantly higher with Bob. 
* **50% Markup:**  A starting price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher profit.
* **Confident Language:** The message uses confident language to convey the product's value and encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Depending on your negotiation style and your assessment of Bob, you could adjust the price and message accordingly."
