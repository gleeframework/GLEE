{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and more likely to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm briefly mentioning the product's value to make Bob think about its potential benefits.

I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate until we reach a mutually agreeable price.  However, if he doesn't come close to my minimum price ($100), I'll happily accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.** While it's closer than his initial perceived value of $80, it's still not profitable enough for me. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being attractive to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $95? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my desired price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still staying firm on my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to keep negotiating.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating that my price is fair and beneficial for both parties.

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I'm hopeful he'll accept, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation might result in a higher price, but it would also require more time and effort. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale quickly and avoid the risk of Bob walking away or further negotiation falling through. 

**While I'd prefer to sell for $100, the potential benefits of a quick sale outweigh the minor price difference.**  I'm confident that this is the best decision given the current circumstances."
