"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $600,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your desire to sell. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $600,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the progress we've made in negotiations. Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $700,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $715,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the progress we've made in negotiations.
