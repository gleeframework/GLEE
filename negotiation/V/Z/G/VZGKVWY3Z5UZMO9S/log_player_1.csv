Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
This is a good starting point because: 

* **It's a strong opening price:**  It's close to your ideal price but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's a friendly message:** Starting off positive and engaging can make Bob more likely to negotiate. 
* **It acknowledges value:**  You're highlighting that the product is valuable to Bob, which could make him more willing to pay. 

Remember, your goal is to get as close to $120 as possible without pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $95?  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$95 is still below your minimum:** You've established a minimum of $80 with John, so accepting $95 isn't a huge loss but also isn't ideal. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's offer indicates he's willing to pay more than $80. This suggests there's room to find a mutually agreeable price closer to your desired $110. 
* **Strategic bargaining:** Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but also maintains your bargaining power. 

Let's see if you can push Bob closer to your target price in the next round!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $95 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $105 to make this worthwhile.  This product is worth more than $95, and I'm confident you'll get great value from it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise from your initial $110, but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  You emphasize the product's value again, reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal even at $105.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to continue discussing and potentially reach a final agreement."
