"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking $110 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still a bit too high. You're aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $95?  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $95 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $105 to make this worthwhile.  This product is worth more than $95, and I'm confident you'll get great value from it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $105 is a good deal. It's within your budget and closer to your initial counter-offer. You're saving $15 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price, and you risk losing the deal."
