"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. How about $9,000? I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I have to make a profit, and $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is my final offer. ",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
