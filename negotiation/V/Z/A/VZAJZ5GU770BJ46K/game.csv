"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be very happy with your purchase.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",10200.0,Alice,5,
