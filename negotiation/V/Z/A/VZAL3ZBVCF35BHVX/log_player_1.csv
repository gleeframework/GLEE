Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

We're trying to close the gap quickly while staying well above Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70

Bob is still far below your minimum.  It's time to nudge him closer to your price or take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to $150 to make this work.  Would you be willing to do $130?"",

We're holding firm closer to your minimum while still encouraging Bob to counter. This makes it clear you're serious about the value but open to a deal."
