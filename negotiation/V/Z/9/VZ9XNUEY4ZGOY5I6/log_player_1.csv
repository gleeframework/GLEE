Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position. Here's an approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start high within the ZOPA, maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys value and fairness, but doesn't sound desperate.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While you aim high, the price leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate if he wishes.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and your understanding of Bob, you might adjust the price and message."
