{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in your product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer. How about $125? That's still a fair price for a product worth $120 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in buying your product but $125 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $115?  It's a good compromise and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $115 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference at $120? That's fair to both of us and we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now within your budget, and it's the same price as John's. There's no reason to continue negotiating and risk losing the deal.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
