"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Can you consider that?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle anytime soon. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider that?,14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $16000? It's still a good price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit short on budget, and I'm not sure I can go up to $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $13500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $15000? It's the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price for the product considering its value.",15000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,10,
