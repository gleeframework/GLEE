Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm also factoring in the potential for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000. There's always a risk that I could get a higher price in future rounds, but it's not worth risking a sale completely."
