"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you as it's significantly less than the value it holds for your company.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, claiming she has another buyer at a lower price. This is a common negotiation tactic. 
* You know John will sell it to you for $1,500,000, so there's no immediate rush.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially propose a better deal closer to her actual valuation of $1,200,000."
