Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is significantly higher than your minimum but leaves room for bargaining. It also expresses confidence in the value proposition of the product for Bob, potentially encouraging him to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still provides you with significant value, and it's closer to my desired price point.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to your desired point. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $800,000, which is a more secure and profitable option than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
