I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for my minimum price. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while ensuring I don't lose out on a sale."
