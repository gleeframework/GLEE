"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a starting point that aims for a good chunk of the potential value for me. It leaves some room for negotiation and should encourage Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try and get a better price. While selling to John guarantees me $800,000, I'm aiming for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and countering with a price of $850,000. This is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to settle yet and believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to $825,000, acknowledging that Bob isn't willing to go much higher. This compromise leaves some room for negotiation but also gets me closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I hope Bob will see this as a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, we're running out of time, and I'm not confident we can reach a deal. To secure a guaranteed profit, it's best to sell to John for $800,000."
