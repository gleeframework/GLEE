Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This price is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a little more for the product, as it's worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer will secure a sale and a decent profit. I'll take it!"
