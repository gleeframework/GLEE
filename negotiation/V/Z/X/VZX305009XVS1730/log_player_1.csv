Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $115 is higher than $100, but still within a range where Bob might be willing to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $115 is above your minimum of $120, leaving room for potential negotiation.

This approach allows for a potential negotiation with Bob while also providing a safety net with John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum of $120. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. You have a safety net with John's offer, so there's no immediate need to settle for a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a good price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** $110 is a middle ground between your previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $105. 
* **Highlight the benefit for Bob:** Emphasizing that $110 is still a ""great deal"" for Bob keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages him to consider your offer. 
* **Maintain your minimum:** $110 is still above your minimum of $120, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $108 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  You have a guaranteed $120 from John, making it risky to settle for a lower price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price, or you can ultimately choose to sell to John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise further:** $109 is a compromise between your previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $108. 
* **Show flexibility:**  Demonstrating your willingness to negotiate helps keep the conversation open.
* **Maintain a margin:**  $109 is still above your minimum of $120, but it's getting closer to a point where you might consider selling to John if Bob continues to be unwilling to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $107 is below your minimum of $120.  You've already made several concessions, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a price that meets your needs.  

Selling to John for $120 guarantees you your minimum and saves you further negotiation time. It's the most logical choice at this point."
