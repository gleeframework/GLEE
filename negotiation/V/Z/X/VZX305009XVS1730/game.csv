"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a good price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
