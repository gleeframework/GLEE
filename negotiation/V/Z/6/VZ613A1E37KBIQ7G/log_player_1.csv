This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay.  It leaves room for negotiation, but also signals your confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not quite there. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
