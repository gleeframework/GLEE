Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that beats John's offer of $100.  It's better to secure the product at a known good price than risk further negotiation and potentially miss out on both deals."
