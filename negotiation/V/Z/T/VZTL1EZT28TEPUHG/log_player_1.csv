Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

While I could try to push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good deal. It exceeds my minimum price and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or losing him as a buyer."
