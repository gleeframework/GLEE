Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can go down to $950,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. While $725,000 is a move in the right direction, it's too much of a loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but not at this steep of a discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I see where you're coming from, but that price doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  Let's settle at $875,000. This is a significant compromise and my final offer."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling to Bob that I'm serious about this price and unlikely to go much lower. 
* **Middle Ground (Almost):**  This offer is closer to a middle ground between my previous offer and his, but still leans more in my favor, as it should.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, we're getting closer to the possibility of me selling to John. This creates a subtle pressure for Bob to act."
