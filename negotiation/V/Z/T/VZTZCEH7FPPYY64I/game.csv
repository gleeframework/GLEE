"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can go down to $950,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I see where you're coming from, but that price doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  Let's settle at $875,000. This is a significant compromise and my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
