You can do better than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $10,500. It's a good starting point, and still leaves some room for negotiation if Alice wants to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a good deal for me. I can either accept this offer or keep trying to negotiate with Alice, but there's a risk she might become unwilling to deal and I'd be stuck going to John. It's better to accept the offer and save the potential hassle."
