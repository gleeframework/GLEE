"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth a significant amount to me, at least $1500000. I believe it holds great value and potential for you as well.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.  This price reflects the product's inherent worth and the potential for mutual benefit.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000. While she claims the product is worth more to her, this doesn't impact your decision. You have a guaranteed alternative with John for a significantly lower price."
