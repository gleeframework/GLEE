"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,100,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profit while also keeping the negotiation open for potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round. I still have room to negotiate without losing too much, and I haven't exhausted all possibilities with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.  I believe we can reach an agreement within a few more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with him. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving significant profit on the table, and I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still a good price for me, and I believe it's within Bob's range.  I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot that gets us to an agreement.  We're getting close to the halfway point in the negotiation, so I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I have a strong sense that we're on the verge of agreement, and I'm not willing to give up just yet.  I'm confident that I can get a slightly higher price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and it's only $50,000 more than what Bob offered. I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us. 

We are getting very close to the end of the negotiation process, and I'm not ready to settle for John's offer yet. I believe this counteroffer will be the deciding factor in securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now equal to John's offer. It's clear that we've reached a stalemate, and it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer any further. While I'm not thrilled about accepting John's offer, it's the most logical choice at this point.  There is no guarantee I can get a better price from Bob in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale altogether.  It's time to lock in the $800,000 and move on."
