"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $900000 is a good starting point, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's continue this conversation and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm excited about the potential it holds.",950000.0,Bob,4,
