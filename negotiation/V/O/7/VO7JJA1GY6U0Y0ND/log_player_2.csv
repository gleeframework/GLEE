"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something you'll truly value. I'm confident it's worth $1450000 to you, considering the potential benefits.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit above my budget.  Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits and value this product offers, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1375000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is within your budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer. It's a good deal for you, considering you're still saving money compared to buying from John.  It's also likely that further negotiation won't get you a substantially lower price, especially since Alice has already compromised."
