"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds.  I'm also mindful of my backup option with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't yield a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I need to explore further negotiation before considering a sale at this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum value. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm firm on my value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to get.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'm also taking into account that we are already halfway through the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum value. I'm not quite ready to sell to John, and I still think I can get a better price from Bob with more negotiation.  I'm willing to take a risk and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise.  It's also still above my minimum value of $1,500,000.  We are nearing the end of the negotiations and I'm hoping to close the deal with a price that is agreeable to both of us."
