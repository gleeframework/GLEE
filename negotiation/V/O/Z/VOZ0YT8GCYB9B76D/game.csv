"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $950,000.  This price is a good compromise, giving you a solid profit while still saving me a significant amount. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This offer reflects the value I place on the product while also allowing you to make a healthy profit. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can push the price up a bit more.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
