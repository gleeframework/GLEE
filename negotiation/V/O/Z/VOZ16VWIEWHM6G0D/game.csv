"Thanks for showing me the product, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, Alice. $90 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise at $85. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to accept $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $80, which would be $82.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",82.5,Alice,7,
