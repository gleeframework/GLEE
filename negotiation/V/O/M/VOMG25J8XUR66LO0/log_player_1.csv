Round 2
Bob's offer:

While $10,500 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. It's worth holding out for a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a fair offer, I'm looking to get closer to $11,000 for this product. It's truly unique and worth the investment. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $10,500? I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting close to my minimum, but I've already gone through several rounds and it's not clear if we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed profit and ensures I don't lose out on the opportunity."
