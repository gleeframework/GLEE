"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least that much to me and I know you value it as well. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $8,500 is more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $7,500 for the product. I know it's worth a lot to you, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,250 is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $8,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer, potentially getting closer to his target price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $8,250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that."", ""product_price"": 8000}
