"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my original offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
