"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $9,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  $10,200 is getting close, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I think this product is worth every penny, and I'm not willing to compromise on the price. However, I'm willing to throw in a special bonus package worth $200 to sweeten the deal. This package includes a premium warranty and a personalized consultation with the product's creator. Would you be interested in this revised offer?",9500.0,Alice,7,
