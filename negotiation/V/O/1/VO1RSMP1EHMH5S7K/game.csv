"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the starting price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this caliber, but I think we can find a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your offer of $900,000, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly and propose $1,100,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
