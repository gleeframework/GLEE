"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with an ambitious offer significantly above both my minimum ($800,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** My message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high initial price. This framing focuses on the benefits to Bob rather than just the monetary amount.
* **Alternative:**  I am aware that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 at any time. This serves as my ""walk-away"" point â€“ I won't accept any deal below this amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the starting price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this caliber, but I think we can find a more reasonable price. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I started high to create this space. Accepting immediately might leave money on the table. I'll counter-offer in the next round to guide the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your offer of $900,000, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly and propose $1,100,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a counteroffer of $1,100,000, which is a $100,000 reduction from my initial offer. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm still aiming for a high price. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** By reducing my price by a larger increment than Bob's increase, I'm encouraging him to move closer to my target range. 
* **Continued Emphasis on Value:**  I continue to emphasize the ""true value"" of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its benefits and the reasons he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $950,000 is a significant profit above my minimum of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly engaged and willing to negotiate. However, his message suggests he's nearing his upper limit (""stay within my budget""). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push for a higher price carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting this offer secures a very good deal."
