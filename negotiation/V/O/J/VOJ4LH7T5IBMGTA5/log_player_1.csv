"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to let the product go for $9,000.  That way we both get something out of this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but I'm still only able to pay $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's more than what I would pay John. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $9,500?  That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to get something out of this deal. What do you say?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I still see potential for a better deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a little low for me.  How about we compromise at $9,250? That's halfway between our last offers and a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
