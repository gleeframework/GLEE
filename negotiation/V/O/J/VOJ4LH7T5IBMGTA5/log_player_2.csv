# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to let the product go for $9,000.  That way we both get something out of this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but I'm still only able to pay $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's more than what I would pay John. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $9,500?  That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to get something out of this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a little low for me.  How about we compromise at $9,250? That's halfway between our last offers and a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiations. You're confident you can get the product from John for a better price."
