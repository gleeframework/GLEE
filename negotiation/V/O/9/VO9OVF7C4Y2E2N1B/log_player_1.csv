Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value, aiming to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $132 is very close and still a good profit for me. It's also likely that if I reject this offer and counter again, Bob might walk away, leaving me with only the $120 offer from John. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
