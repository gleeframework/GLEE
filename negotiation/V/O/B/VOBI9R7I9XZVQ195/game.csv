"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this price better reflects the value I can reasonably expect from the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's potential for your business is immense, and $850,000 is a significant undervaluation. Let's find a middle ground â€“ I propose $920,000.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $920,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
