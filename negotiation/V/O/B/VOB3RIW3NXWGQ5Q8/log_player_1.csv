Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair offer. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,250,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and your belief in a fair deal. This encourages Bob to seriously consider the offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* Bob's risk tolerance and negotiating skills are unknown. There's a chance he'll reject the offer, and you'll get the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. A different approach might involve a lower price to ensure a quicker and more certain sale."
