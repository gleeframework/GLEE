"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to get the product for closer to $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:** $13,500 is only $500 more than Bob's ideal price of $13,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Rejecting again might lead to more rounds, potentially increasing the price or wasting time. There's a chance Alice might become less flexible.
* **John's offer is still higher:**  While $13,500 isn't Bob's absolute best price, it's still a better deal than buying from John.

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking a drawn-out negotiation or a higher cost with John."
