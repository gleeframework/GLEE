"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation.  I want to maximize my profit while still being within Bob's likely range.  $14,500 is a strong starting point, and allows for potential concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to get the product for closer to $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  However, I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
