"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for the product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,250,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial profit margin. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be open to that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  $1,100,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,150,000? This price is fair to both of us and ensures you get a great deal on a valuable product. Let's finalize this deal!",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really making this tempting. $1,150,000 is very close, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle right at the midpoint, $1,125,000, and call it a deal?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
