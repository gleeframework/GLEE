"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. I value it highly, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. It's an investment you won't regret."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since the product's value is $1,000,000 to both parties,  starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial offer acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value and his counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob is worthwhile in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below the product's value to both of us. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Early Stages:** It's still early in the negotiation. Rejecting this low offer signals that I'm serious about the product's value and open to a more reasonable discussion.
* **Potential with Bob:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's still potential to secure a price closer to our target with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to be flexible, but it needs to be a fair deal. How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Move:**  We're cutting our initial price by $250,000 to show Bob we're serious about negotiating and willing to make concessions.
* **Middle Ground:** Aiming for the midpoint between our initial offer and Bob's lowball offer  ($1,500,000 and $500,000) seems like a sensible starting point for further negotiation.
* **Still Above John:**  This counteroffer keeps us well above John's guaranteed $1,000,000, preserving our potential for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try to find a compromise at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, $750,000 remains significantly below both the product's actual value and our desired outcome.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We are still relatively early in the negotiation process (6 rounds left). Rejecting this offer indicates that we believe a higher price is achievable.
* **John as a Backstop:**  We have the security of John's offer. If Bob continues to lowball, we can always walk away and accept John's guaranteed $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, compromise is key. Let's bridge the gap. How about $1,125,000? It reflects the product's value while recognizing your willingness to move."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** We're making another significant move downward ($125,000), demonstrating our commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Calculated Compromise:** The new offer splits the difference between our last counteroffer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000),  signaling a  strong willingness to negotiate. 
* **Above John, but Approaching:** This price remains comfortably above John's guaranteed offer, but we're getting closer to a point where the difference may not justify the risk of continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could go up to $875,000.  Do you think we can make a deal work at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  While Bob's offer has increased, his increments are getting smaller. We've made significant concessions, and it seems unlikely he'll reach a price that justifies the risk of continuing.
* **Time vs. Value:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation, and the difference between Bob's offer ($875,000) and John's guarantee ($1,000,000) is shrinking. 
* **Guaranteed Return:** John's offer provides certainty. It's time to prioritize a guaranteed profit over the hope of a slightly higher but uncertain outcome with Bob."
