"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to be flexible, but it needs to be a fair deal. How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try to find a compromise at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, compromise is key. Let's bridge the gap. How about $1,125,000? It reflects the product's value while recognizing your willingness to move.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
