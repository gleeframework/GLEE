"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $1,800,000 is above your maximum budget, so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range for you.  It leaves room for negotiation and might tempt Alice to accept."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum threshold. You have room to negotiate further, and there's a chance Alice will accept a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Alice's offer but still below your limit.  This might incentivize Alice to accept and finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit but still above it. It's getting too risky to keep negotiating, as Alice might further increase the price. At this point, buying from John at $1,500,000 is a safer option to ensure you get the product within your budget."
