"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers you significant value, and I'm confident it's worth a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"You're right, Bob, we're getting closer. I value your willingness to negotiate fairly. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750? That feels like a solid compromise to me.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  I'm willing to come up a bit to $11,250.  Do you think that would work?",11250.0,Bob,6,
