"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000.** This is above your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **John's offer is $12,000.** This is also above your maximum budget, but it's the best option compared to Alice's offer. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate with John or potentially find another seller who is willing to sell the product for a price closer to your budget."
