Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to me ($12,000) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in future rounds, and selling to John would result in the same profit. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees the sale and a profit."
