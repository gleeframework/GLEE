Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth a maximum of $800,000 to me,  so I'd be willing to offer you $500,000.  I think that's a fair starting point considering the gap between our valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000.
