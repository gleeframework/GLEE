Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $650,000 is closer, I'm still seeking a price closer to my initial valuation.  Let's try $800,000.  This offer reflects the significant value this product holds.

This is the best option. Alice has come down to your maximum price, and there's no guarantee you can negotiate further. Taking the deal now secures the product at the best possible price."
