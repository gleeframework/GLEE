"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to get the product from John for his desired price."
