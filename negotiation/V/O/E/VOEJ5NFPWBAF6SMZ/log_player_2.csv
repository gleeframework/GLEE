"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There are more rounds of negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:** While $9,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and is within Bob's budget.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice rejecting Bob's offer and increasing the price again.  There's also the risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate further.
* **The alternative is expensive:**  Buying from John for $12,000 is a significantly worse deal than accepting Alice's offer.

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer at $9,500 is the most reasonable choice in this round."
