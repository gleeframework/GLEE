"Bob, I have a truly exceptional product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident that you'll see the tremendous return on your investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and the value of the product seems promising. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. Could we perhaps discuss a price closer to $800000? I believe this might be a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go as low as your offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This price reflects a substantial discount for you while still allowing me to cover the value of the product.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the current market conditions and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $950000. This price strikes a balance between our interests and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,
