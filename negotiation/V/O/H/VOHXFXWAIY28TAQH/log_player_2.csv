"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($120), it's still lower than what you'd pay John ($150). Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
