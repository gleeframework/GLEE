"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you a substantial return on your investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,100,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
