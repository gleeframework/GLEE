# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

The product is worth $800,000 to you, so you can do better than $900,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $887,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is unwilling to budge further. You've already made a counteroffer at your desired price of $862,500, and Alice's final offer is $887,500. This is still higher than your maximum budget. 

It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer of $800,000.  You've already saved a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer."
