"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and the potential of the product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000, reflecting the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and settle on $862,500. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $887,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
