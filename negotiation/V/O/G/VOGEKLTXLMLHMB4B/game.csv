"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $900,000 falls significantly short of its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering both our needs, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is still below what I'd ideally like, I'm willing to accept $1,025,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to make a final offer of $975,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering we've both moved significantly from our initial positions.",975000.0,Bob,6,
