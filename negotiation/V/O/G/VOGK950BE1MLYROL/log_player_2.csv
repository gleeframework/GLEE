It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a backup option with John, you have room to try and get a better deal from Alice."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but also leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price considering my initial offer of $800,000 was rejected.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and I'd be stuck paying John $1,000,000.  $850,000 is a good compromise and saves me $150,000 compared to John's price."
