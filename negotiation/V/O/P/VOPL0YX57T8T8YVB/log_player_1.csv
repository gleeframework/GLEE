Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,000,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product to your operations is much higher. I could be persuaded to agree on a price of $1,200,000.  This offer represents a fair balance between value and investment."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow us to finalize the transaction.
