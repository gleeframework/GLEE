"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high. You have a significant buffer before reaching your maximum price of $1,500,000, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,000,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product to your operations is much higher. I could be persuaded to agree on a price of $1,200,000.  This offer represents a fair balance between value and investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,200,000 is still too high. You have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down a bit more, as she wants to close the deal."
