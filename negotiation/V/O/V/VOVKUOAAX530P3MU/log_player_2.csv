Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $980,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980,000 and $1,025,000, which would be $1,002,500. Let's see if we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,002,500.

It's unlikely we'll get Alice much lower than this, and the difference at this point is relatively small compared to John's offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of further negotiation."
