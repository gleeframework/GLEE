"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. The price I'm willing to sell it to you for is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000, but I'm open to some negotiation. How about we meet at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine and settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still think the product is worth more than $950,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,025,000. How about we meet at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I respect that.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to close this out at $980,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $980,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980,000 and $1,025,000, which would be $1,002,500. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",1002500.0,Alice,7,
