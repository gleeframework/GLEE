"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a game-changer and would greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still saving a significant amount compared to the initial offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product will bring to your business.
