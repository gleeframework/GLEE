"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product brings to your operations.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the potential you'll realize from this product. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product.  While your offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and a great price for the value this product brings. Let's seal the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $1,075,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my original offer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
