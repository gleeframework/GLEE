Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This price is above his perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point as it gives me a healthy profit while also incentivizing Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counter-offering with $95. This price is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 93}
```

I'm offering $93 as my counteroffer. This price is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still within a range I'm comfortable with. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal."
