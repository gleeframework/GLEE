"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer, as it will give me valuable insight into his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss compared to my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer and try to find a price that is closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to meet John's offer at $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's a fair compromise considering Bob's low offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this price and accept it to avoid losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept such a large discount from my desired value. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I'm prepared to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This is a compromise to show Bob that I am serious about negotiating, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if this lower offer is appealing enough to Bob to close the deal before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even if it's getting closer.  I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than John's offer, and I'm hopeful that Bob will come up with a more reasonable price.  I will continue to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,050,000. This is a significant drop, and I'm getting closer to Bob's offers, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is finally in the range I'm willing to consider, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm now running out of rounds. To guarantee I get at least my minimum acceptable price, I will sell the product to John."
