"Alice, $22,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. Would you consider $10,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it's a fair offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about $12,000? I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I believe this price could be mutually beneficial.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the price needs to reflect the true value of this product.  I could consider $15,000, my absolute lowest price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
