Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $90 for it.  Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a little closer to my ideal price.  Bob's offer is close, but I'm not ready to accept it yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $87. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $87. How about we meet in the middle at $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, Bob's counteroffer is a good compromise, and we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's better to secure the sale than risk losing him and having to settle with John for $80."
