Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're on a budget.  While $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe still a good value for you.
