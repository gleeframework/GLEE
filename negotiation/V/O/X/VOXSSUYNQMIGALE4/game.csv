"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you! My asking price is $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, I'm on a tight budget and $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're on a budget.  While $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe still a good value for you.",8000.0,Alice,3,
