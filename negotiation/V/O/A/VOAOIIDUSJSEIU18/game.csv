"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'd like to throw in a small concession. I'll sell the product to you for $13,200, and I'll also include a premium service package that's worth $200. This way, you'll get the product and some additional benefits for a price that's still a great deal for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,5,
