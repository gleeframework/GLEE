"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the product's value at $20,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $19,000?  I believe that's a competitive price that reflects the product's quality and benefits.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $17,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence but $17,000 is cutting a bit too close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $18,000? This offer stands as a compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,5,

I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",17500.0,Bob,6,
