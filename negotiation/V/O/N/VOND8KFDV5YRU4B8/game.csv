"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring you significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree this product is valuable, I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a bit closer to your target, but still reflects the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I like that.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,062,500?  This would be a win-win for both of us.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,062,500 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000 was too low, so I'm going to try $1,085,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings to you.",1085000.0,Alice,7,
