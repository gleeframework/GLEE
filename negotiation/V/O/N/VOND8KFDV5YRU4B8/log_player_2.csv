I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000 was too low, so I'm going to try $1,085,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000

This seems to be the best Alice is willing to offer. Accepting the $1,085,000  price gets you the product for a good price below your absolute limit and avoids the risk of pushing Alice away and having to pay John's much higher price."
