"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is far above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to buy from John, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $15,000 was a bit steep, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above my budget.  I'm not willing to go above $8,500, and I believe I can still convince Alice to come down to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still outside my price range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $8,500, which is $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to my price range, $11,250 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  I want to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to my offer of $8,500. There's still time to negotiate a better deal, and it's too early to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,250 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm firm on my offer of $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high for my budget. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price I can afford.  To avoid risking further negotiations and potentially losing out on the product, I'm going to purchase it from John for $8,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
