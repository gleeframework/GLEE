"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business.

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15,000 was a bit steep, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still outside my price range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $8,500, which is $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,250 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm firm on my offer of $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,7,
