"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,050,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm hoping we can reach a deal on this round.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm offering $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers.  Let's aim for a quick resolution.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 simply isn't enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,087,500. This compromise should be fair to both of us.  Let's work towards a deal!",1087500.0,Alice,5,
