"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  This still leaves room for you to make a good profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
