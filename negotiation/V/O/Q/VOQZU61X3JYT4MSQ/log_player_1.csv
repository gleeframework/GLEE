Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" to justify the higher price, making it seem less arbitrary. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The tone leaves space for Bob to negotiate. Even if he counters, there's a good chance of settling above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts the initial offer, you secure a significant profit margin."
