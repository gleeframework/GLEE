"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000.
