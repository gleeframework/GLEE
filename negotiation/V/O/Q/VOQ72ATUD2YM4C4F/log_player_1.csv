Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I value the product at no less than $100, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I offer it to him for $120.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the minimum value I have for the product. I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll offer Bob a price of $115, which is slightly higher than his offer and still below my initial offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here is my counteroffer to Bob:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value for the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it to him for that price. I'll decide to reject his offer and make another counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll offer Bob a price of $108, which is slightly higher than his offer and closer to my initial offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is now at the minimum value I have for the product. I've already rejected offers that are higher than this, so I might as well accept his offer and sell the product to him. After all, I can always sell it to John for $100 if Bob rejects this offer.
