"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily routine and bring convenience to your life.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure both parties are satisfied, I propose a price of $175 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $175 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $155 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're finding common ground. To reach an agreement that benefits both of us, I propose a final price of $160 for the product.
