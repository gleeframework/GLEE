"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This still gives you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but no higher. Can you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $750,000 is still too low. Let's try $825,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our positions. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $825,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000, so I'll offer $787,500. Can you consider that?",787500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $787,500 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own needs. I hope we can close the deal now.",800000.0,Alice,7,
