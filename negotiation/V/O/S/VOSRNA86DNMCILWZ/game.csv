"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $1350000 for this product.  It's a significant asset, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your price.  However, $1275000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1312500. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while also being within your budget. What do you think?",1312500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1290000.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly, but I need at least $1300000 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
