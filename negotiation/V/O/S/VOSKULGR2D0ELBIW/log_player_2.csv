"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product at a price of $1200000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay ($1,500,000) and higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000). This means there's room for a profitable deal for both of you. Accepting the offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
