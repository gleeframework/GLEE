"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is good, but there's a chance I can get it for even less. I'll try negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $6,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $6,500 is closer to my goal, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further. It's early in the rounds, and I think Alice might be willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $6,200? That's a fair price, and I'd be ready to close the deal right away."",
""product_price"": 6200
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6,200. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll sell the product to you for $6,400. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle.  $6,400 is a good price, and continuing to negotiate might annoy her and risk the deal. I'll accept."
