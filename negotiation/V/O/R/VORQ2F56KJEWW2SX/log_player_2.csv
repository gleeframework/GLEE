"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, valued at over a million dollars to me. I believe it has the potential to be just as valuable to you.  Let's start with a price of $1500000. This allows room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiating and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This price still allows for a good margin for me, but also demonstrates my desire to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $1,200,000. I'm going to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000, which I believe is fair considering my budget constraints.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and your continued interest in the product.  While $1150000 is closer to my desired price,  I need to make sure this deal makes sense for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1200000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you'll consider this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my maximum budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll end up buying from John at the same price.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the product."
