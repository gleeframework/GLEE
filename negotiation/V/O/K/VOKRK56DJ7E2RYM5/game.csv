"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
