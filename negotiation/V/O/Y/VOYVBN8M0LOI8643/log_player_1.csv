Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. I'm confident it's a fair price considering its potential benefits. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming for a better profit margin.
* **Confidence and value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to discuss the price, signaling a willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his proposed price.
* If the negotiation stalls, I'll consider selling to John for $12,000 as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $15,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Selling to John would ensure I don't lose money.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to lower my price but not significantly.  
* **Counter-offering strategy:**  I want to see how committed Bob is to the deal. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer that indicates my willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear lower limit. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $16,000, which is still a fair price while giving Bob some room to agree. I'll also emphasize the value of the product to encourage him to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 doesn't quite cover my costs for this product. I understand you have a budget, but this product truly offers [briefly mention a key benefit that Bob would value]. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but also showing a willingness to negotiate by counteroffering.
* **Value-Focused:** I highlight a specific benefit that Bob would likely value, emphasizing the worth of the product.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to strike a balance between my needs and Bob's budget.
* **Direct and Concise:** The message is clear and avoids unnecessary jargon.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, the deal is done!
* If Bob rejects, I will assess the situation. If he's unwilling to budge, I will move forward with selling to John.
* If Bob makes a counteroffer that's closer to $16,000, I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your costs, but I'm still only able to go up to $15500. This product would be a great benefit to me, and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $16,000, the negotiation seems to be stalling.
* **Potential for a quick sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale without further negotiation, which saves time and effort.
* **Risk of losing to John:** Holding out for a higher price risks losing Bob as a buyer and potentially being forced to sell to John at a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This ensures I get a decent price and avoid further risk of losing a buyer."
