"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be worth it. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
