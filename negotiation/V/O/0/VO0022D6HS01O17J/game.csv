"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to your business.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit. If that works for you, let's seal the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, considering the product's value, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $14,500. This is my final compromise.",14500.0,Alice,5,
