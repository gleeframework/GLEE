"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,125,000.  This price still provides you with a significant value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 as a final concession. This is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for both of us?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
