"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",18000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,20000.0
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $18000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for.",20000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $20000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $19500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",19500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,21000.0
"I understand that $19500 is as high as you're willing to go, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to give you a bit more room to negotiate, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $21000. This is a compromise, but I think it's the best we can do.",21000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $21000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $19500. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",19500.0,Bob,6,,
