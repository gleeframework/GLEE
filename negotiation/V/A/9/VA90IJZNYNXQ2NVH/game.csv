"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product looks promising, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price between $800,000 and $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me.  How about we settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $850,000. How about we try $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $975,000 is still a bit steep.  Could you do $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,7,
