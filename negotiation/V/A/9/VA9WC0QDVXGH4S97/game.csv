"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a compromise at $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still not a price that works for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to be at least at $1,000,000. This price still offers you a good deal considering the product's value.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both show a willingness to compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
