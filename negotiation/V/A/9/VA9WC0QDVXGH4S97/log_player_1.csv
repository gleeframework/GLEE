"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate with Bob further to try and reach a more favorable price.  I also have the safety net of selling to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a compromise at $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, his offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I have only 6 rounds left, and selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll be more willing to consider selling to John if Bob doesn't meet me closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still not a price that works for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to be at least at $1,000,000. This price still offers you a good deal considering the product's value.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both show a willingness to compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
