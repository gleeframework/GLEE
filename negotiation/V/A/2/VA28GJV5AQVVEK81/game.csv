"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $10,250. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",10250.0,Alice,5,
