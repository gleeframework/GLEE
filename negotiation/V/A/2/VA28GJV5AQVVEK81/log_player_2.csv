Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $10,250. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is very slowly coming down in price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a price significantly better than John's offer of $10,000. It's time to cut negotiations short and go with the guaranteed better deal."
