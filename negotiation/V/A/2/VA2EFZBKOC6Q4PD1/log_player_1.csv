Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a better price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm making a counteroffer at $9,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's still below my initial asking price. I'm hoping that by showing some willingness to compromise, I can get Bob closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting increasingly lower, and it's now below my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed profit and the best option at this point."
