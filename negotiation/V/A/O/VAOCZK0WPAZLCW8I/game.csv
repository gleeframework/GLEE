"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I know it's worth even more to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This gives you a great deal and ensures I get a fair price.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
