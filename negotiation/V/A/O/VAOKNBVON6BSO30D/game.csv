"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $18,000 represents the high end of its value,  $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
