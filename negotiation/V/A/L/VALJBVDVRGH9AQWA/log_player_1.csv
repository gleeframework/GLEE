"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind the value of the product to me and the possibility of selling to John if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise by lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still remaining above Bob's offer. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject it and try to secure a higher price in the next round. I have some room to maneuver, and I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again, but only by a small amount. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still firm on my minimum value for the product. I'm confident that this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, especially as it's only $50,000 below his own perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally met my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially negotiate a higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer is too high. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum value and close the deal."
