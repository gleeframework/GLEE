"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This price is a fair compromise and reflects the true value of the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're close to your target price, but it's still worth trying to get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you another chance to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, it's unlikely you'll be able to get her down to $12,000.  You're already at a point where you're saving a significant amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer, but you can secure the product for your maximum price with John.  Buying from John guarantees the best outcome in this situation."
