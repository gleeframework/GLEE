"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's continue discussing and see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer,  $950,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Given the value of this product to you, I believe $1,050,000 is a fair price that reflects a mutually beneficial deal. Let's continue to work towards an agreement that satisfies both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
