"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This reflects the immense potential and unique advantages this product offers. What do you say?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,800,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $2,000,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",2000000.0,Bob,4,
