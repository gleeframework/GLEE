Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""unique value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without directly stating it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you encourage him to engage in the conversation and potentially counter-offer, leading to a potentially higher sale price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $10,000, he doesn't know your minimum price. He might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation, especially if he perceives a sense of scarcity or exclusivity.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below your minimum of $15,000."
