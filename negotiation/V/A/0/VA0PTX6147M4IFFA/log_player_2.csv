"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice for $120 is the best option.** You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. This means you're getting a good deal and saving $30 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $150 is less desirable.** This would mean you're paying the full price you're willing to pay, and you're not getting any discount."
