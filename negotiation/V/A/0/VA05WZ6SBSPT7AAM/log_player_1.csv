Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've started with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the value and opportunity for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Note:** This is just the starting point. Depending on Bob's response and the flow of the negotiation, I'll adjust my offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not ready to accept his offer just yet.  

**Next Steps:** I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I've countered Bob's offer with a price of $17,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""fair price"" and the opportunity to ""make this deal happen,"" creating a sense of urgency and a shared goal. 
* **Negotiation Continued:** The message leaves room for further discussion and allows Bob to potentially counter again, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, there's a risk that I might not reach a satisfactory agreement. 

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $15,000, it's the most logical decision to sell the product to John. This ensures I receive my minimum acceptable value and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
