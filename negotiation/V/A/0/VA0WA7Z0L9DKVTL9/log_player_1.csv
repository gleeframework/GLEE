"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is a valuable asset that can greatly benefit you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a starting price of $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering its potential return on investment."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value and potential return on investment, I'm aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher point. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even though my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, I'm starting significantly higher to allow for potential counteroffers and compromises.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still significantly above his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000).  This suggests there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price point closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product holds significant value at $1,600,000, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,500,000? This price reflects the product's true worth and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This common negotiation tactic suggests fairness and compromise. It might make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm above my absolute minimum while still demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** By highlighting a win-win situation, I aim to maintain a positive tone and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, would it be possible to reach an agreement at $1,450,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,450,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Stronger Position:** Bob is steadily increasing his offers, indicating his strong interest in the product. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
