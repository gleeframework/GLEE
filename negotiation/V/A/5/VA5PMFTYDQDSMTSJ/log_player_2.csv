""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much negotiating room there is.  I'm aiming to stay well below my $8,000 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Round 4

}
```

I'm inching closer to my $8,000 limit, but I'm still trying to leave some room for negotiation in case Alice is firm on a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not comfortable with $7,250, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we settle on $7,750?  That's a fair compromise, and it's a price we can both feel good about. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
