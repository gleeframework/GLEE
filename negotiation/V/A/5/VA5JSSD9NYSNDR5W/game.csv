"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is my final offer before considering John's offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,125,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
