Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like we can come to an agreement. 
* **Focus on value:**  I'm not just stating a price, I'm highlighting the value of the product for him (""great deal for both of us""). 
 
This is a strategic starting point, but I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the potential for a higher sale with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I won't accept a price that is too low.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a compromise that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforce value:** I'm reiterating that the product is valuable, and that the price still represents a ""significant discount.""
* **Focus on a win-win:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations moving forward. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move that keeps the negotiations open while still holding firm on my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware that John is willing to pay my full price.  To maximize my profit, I'll choose to sell to John."
