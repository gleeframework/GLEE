"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth $1,750,000. This price reflects its value and potential for your business.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also willing to explore other options if this initial offer isn't a good fit for you.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a price that aligns with my investment. I'm offering you the product for $1,600,000. This price is still within a reasonable range and allows for some flexibility on both our ends.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm eager to close the deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
