"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,500. Let's make this work.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to do $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $11,150. It's a fair price, and we can finally close this deal.",11150.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting down to the wire.  I can do $10,900.  That's a solid offer, and I need to know if we can make it work.",10900.0,Bob,6,
