"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given its value to you at $1,500,000, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000. This would still allow you a substantial profit while being within my range.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. Its unique features and market demand justify a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this strikes a more balanced compromise.  What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and allows you a reasonable profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I'm willing to make this my final offer: $1,475,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end, considering the true value and potential of this product. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",1475000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,475,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000, which represents a considerable increase from my last offer and leaves significant profit margin for you. I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
