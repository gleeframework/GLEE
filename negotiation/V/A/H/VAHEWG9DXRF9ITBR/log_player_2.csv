"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a good price, but it's worth trying to negotiate further.  Alice may be willing to lower her price, especially if she's motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's interest. This aggressive move might make her think I'm more price-sensitive than I actually am, potentially leading her to negotiate down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, and $400,000 is a good price. There's a risk of further negotiation, but it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting her offer saves me time and ensures I get a better price than buying from John."
