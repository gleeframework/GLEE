"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,200. It's a great price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your budget, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $8,100? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise.",8100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I appreciate your willingness to find a price we both feel good about.  To be completely transparent, I have a backup offer for $8,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but only if we can meet that price.  So, $8,000 is my final offer. What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you have a backup offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,050. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to keep the deal going. What do you think?",8050.0,Alice,7,
