,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Let's start with a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm hoping we can find a compromise somewhere in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway and settle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still outside my budget.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours and settle on $11,250? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close the deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,
