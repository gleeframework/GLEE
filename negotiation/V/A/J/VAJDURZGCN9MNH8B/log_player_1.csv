"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Let's start with a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm hoping we can find a compromise somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway and settle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still outside my budget.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours and settle on $11,250? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $12,000 threshold I need. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation rounds."
