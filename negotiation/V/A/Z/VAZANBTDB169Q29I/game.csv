"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I need to ensure that I'm fairly compensated for the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still above my budget.  I believe a price closer to $1100000 would be fair and allow both of us to come to an agreement.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of this product, $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1100000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our previous offers.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I can see that you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1150000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure that I'm fairly compensated for the product. Let's try to meet in the middle at $1125000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
