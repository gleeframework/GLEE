Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still within my budget, and it's likely she won't go lower. While I'd prefer to pay closer to $1,200,000, it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
