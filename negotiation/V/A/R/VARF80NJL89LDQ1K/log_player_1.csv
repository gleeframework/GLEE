{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I'm sure it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer starts at a high price, but leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product to Bob, increasing his incentive to consider the offer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if he's willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This offer is fair and reflects the value we both see in this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm not willing to settle yet. I'm going to counteroffer again, trying to push for a price closer to $1,100,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to maximize my profit."
