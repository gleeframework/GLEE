"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $800,000, so I'm starting high.
* **Bob's Value:** He values it at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **First Offer:** I'm aiming for a significant chunk of the difference, leaving space for counteroffers. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I still need at least $800,000.  
* **Bob's Offer:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still lower than my desired price.
* **Negotiation:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.  There are still 8 rounds, and I have a strong bargaining position.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to split the difference and inch closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** My previous offer was $1,200,000, and Bob's counteroffer was $1,000,000.  I'm splitting the difference and offering $1,100,000.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  This offer still keeps me significantly above my minimum of $800,000.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** I believe there's still some room to negotiate upward, especially with the remaining 7 rounds.

Let's see how Bob responds to this compromise!"

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I still need at least $800,000.
* **Bob's Offer:**  While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. 
* **Negotiation:** I have several rounds remaining, and I can likely push for a better deal.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** Bob's offer was $950,000, and my previous offer was $1,100,000. I'm offering $1,050,000, bridging the gap and showing flexibility.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** This offer keeps me comfortably above my minimum of $800,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  While I'm willing to negotiate further, with only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I'm still holding out for more than $800,000.
* **Bob's Offer:**  While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation:**  With only 4 rounds left, I want to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target.  If I sell to John, I'll get $800,000, so I'm not desperate.

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to split the difference again and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Bob's last offer was $900,000, and my previous offer was $1,050,000.  I'm offering $975,000, splitting the difference and showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Close to My Minimum:** This offer is getting close to my minimum of $800,000, but I'm still not at the point where I'd be willing to sell to John for less.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the deal.  This offer demonstrates my willingness to be flexible while still seeking a fair price.

Let's see if this offer is acceptable to Bob."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm still aiming for more than $800,000.
* **Bob's Offer:**  This offer is too close to my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price when I know the product is worth significantly more to Bob. 
* **Negotiation:** With only 2 rounds remaining, I'm going to make one final counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.  If Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John.

I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, trying to get a bit more than Bob's offer but not pushing too hard."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last chance to negotiate with Bob. I'm willing to come down from my previous offer, but I'm not going to settle for less than $900,000.
* **Compromise:** This offer splits the difference between my last offer ($975,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). 
* **Risk/Reward:** I'm taking a risk by offering this, as it's still significantly more than what John is willing to pay. However, I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to accept. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum Reached:** Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum. 
* **No More Negotiation:** I've already made my final offer, and there's no room for further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John:** This is the best option available to me. While I'd have preferred to get a higher price from Bob, I can't risk losing the deal entirely and getting nothing. Selling to John guarantees me $800,000. 

It's a disappointing outcome, but it's the most financially responsible choice given the circumstances."
