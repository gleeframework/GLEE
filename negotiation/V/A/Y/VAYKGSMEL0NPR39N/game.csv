"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below my minimum. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet halfway at $850,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you accept this price?",800000.0,Bob,4,
