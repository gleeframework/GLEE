"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $90 is within your budget, but you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is $5 lower than Alice's initial offer and still within my budget.  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while aiming to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $87.50. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $87.50 is still more than I want to pay. I'm aiming to get the product for as close to $85 as possible. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $87.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $86, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 86}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $86, which is only $1.50 lower than Alice's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to reach a price closer to my target of $85."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $88. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $88, which is only $3 above my ideal price of $85.  Considering I only have 5 rounds left, and John is willing to sell for $100, it's better to accept this offer and secure the product.  Further negotiation may not yield a better price, and I risk running out of time or having to buy from John at a higher price."
