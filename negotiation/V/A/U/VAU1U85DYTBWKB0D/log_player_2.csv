"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is an exceptional value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay from John ($1,500,000).  This means you can save $600,000 by accepting Alice's offer.  Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, the current offer is still a good deal for you."
