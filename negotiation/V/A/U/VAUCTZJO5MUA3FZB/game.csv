"I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can meet you halfway between $14000 and $12000, so I'll offer it to you for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $11500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12500, which is a bit lower than my initial price, but still a bit higher than your last offer. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
