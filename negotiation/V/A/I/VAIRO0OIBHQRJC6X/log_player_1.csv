Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below Bob's valuation allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still securing a much higher price than John's offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't have a strong existing relationship with Bob where a more collaborative approach might be preferred. 
* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice has any insight into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), she might adjust her offer accordingly."
