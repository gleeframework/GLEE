"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, and even if she isn't, you can still move to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. It's a fair price considering the unique features and value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a significant decrease from her original $900,000 offer.  While this is still higher than my initial counteroffer, it's a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer saves me $150,000 and gets me the product I want."
