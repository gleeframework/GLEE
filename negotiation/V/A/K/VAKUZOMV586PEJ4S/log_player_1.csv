Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room for negotiation and leaves open the possibility of a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer matches my minimum value for the product.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price or no sale at all."
