"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for something within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still believe we can find a better solution. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However,  $10,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind. Let's try this â€“ I can go down to $15,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting your offer. I am still unable to meet you at $15,000 given my budget constraints. I am willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns more closely with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,6,
