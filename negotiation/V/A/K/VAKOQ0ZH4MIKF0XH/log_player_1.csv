"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is a significant amount for Bob but still below the product's worth to him.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting the mutual benefits.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 
* **Strategic Backup:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob goes south."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counterpropose a price of $900,000 for your product. I hope this meets within your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, but there's still room to push for a higher price. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher, as he clearly values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss for me. I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking for something closer to $950,000. This would be a fair compromise and ensure a win-win scenario for both of us. Let's keep this negotiation going!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm not giving in too easily, reminding Bob that I'm still aiming for a higher price.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:** I'm keeping the price above John's offer to ensure I don't lose out on potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $925,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 away from my previous counteroffer. It's a significant improvement and a good compromise.
* **Time is a Factor:** We're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of further rejections and potential stalemate. 
* **Value Over Risk:**  While I could push for slightly higher, the potential risk of Bob backing out or the negotiation collapsing outweighs the potential for a few more thousand dollars. 
* **Secure Profit:**  $925,000 is a solid profit and far better than selling to John for $800,000."
