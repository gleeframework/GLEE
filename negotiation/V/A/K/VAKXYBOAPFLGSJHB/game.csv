"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. I can meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've made some concessions, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11500. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $1000, which will give you additional benefits and support for the product. This way, you'll get the product for $10500 ($11500 - $1000 support package) and the added value of the support package. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
