Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:** My message highlights the benefit to Bob (a good deal) to increase his likelihood of accepting. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm open to negotiation, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer.  However, my starting point is closer to my desired price than to his.
* **Plan B:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While his offer is unacceptable, I can still negotiate. There's room for compromise. 
* **Sell to John is a fallback:** I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm aware that selling to John for $1,200,000 is a viable alternative if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000. This demonstrates flexibility. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so it's a good starting point for the next round.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that the price is still a good deal for him, given its worth. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm using language like ""Let's see if we can reach an agreement"" to signal that I'm open to more discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the price is right. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is getting close:** While his offer is unacceptable, we are getting closer.  
* **Sell to John is a fallback:** If the negotiation breaks down, selling to John for $1,200,000 is a better option.

**Next Move:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price between $1,000,000 and $1,050,000.  I will also reiterate the product's value to Bob and try to understand his reasoning for sticking at $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and his offer of $950,000. This shows a strong commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Finality:** The language ""What do you say?"" suggests a sense of finality, urging Bob to make a decision. 
* **Close to Minimum:** I'm willing to accept $1,000,000, as it's close to my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Move:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation.
* If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John. There's not much more room for negotiation, and I've demonstrated my commitment to finding a deal."
