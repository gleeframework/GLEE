"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. To kick things off, I propose a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given my research and the market value, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for this product. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the valuation. However,  the value of this product extends far beyond standard market comparisons. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects the value I see in this product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
