Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not Too High:** It's not so high that it's immediately rejected, giving Bob a chance to consider it.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 allows me to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and leaves me with a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is too low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **John is a backup:** I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a drastically low offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Value:** The price is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell at a huge loss.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and encourages further negotiation. 

This counteroffer balances the need to get a good price with the desire to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  While I would have preferred more, Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **No Further Negotiation:** There's little room for further negotiation, as Bob has essentially met my minimum. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether and potentially forcing me to sell to John at a lower profit.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a good price while minimizing the risk of losing out on the deal."
