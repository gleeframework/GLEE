"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
