Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she's still significantly above your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000. There's no guarantee Alice will go lower than her current offer of $850,000.  It makes more financial sense to cut your losses and secure the product at the guaranteed lower price from John."
