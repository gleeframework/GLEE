Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, but leaves room for potential bargaining. It's important to remember that you have a ""fallback"" option with John for $800,000, so you can afford to be somewhat firm in your negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $850000. This would still be a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $850,000 is better than selling to John, there's still potential for a better price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $900,000. This would still leave you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping we can reach a price closer to my previous offer of $850000.  Perhaps $875000 would be a good compromise for both of us?  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and you've already pushed the negotiation as far as you likely can. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids further potential delays or uncertainty."
