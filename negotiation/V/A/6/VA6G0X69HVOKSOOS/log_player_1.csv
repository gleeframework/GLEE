"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  There are still many rounds left, and I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering the product's worth to you.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I have several rounds left to work with Bob, and I believe there's more room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $9750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to what I'm willing to accept.  With only a few rounds remaining, it's better to secure the deal rather than risk losing Bob and having to settle for John's lower offer."
