"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $9000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500, which is still a great deal considering the product's worth to you.  Let's find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",10000.0,Alice,5,
