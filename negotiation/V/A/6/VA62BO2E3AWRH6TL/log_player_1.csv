"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.  It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $1,200,000, I'm not desperate. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price in the next round. I'm curious to see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll reject this offer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more. It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not under any pressure to accept this offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,250,000.  This is a significant drop from my last offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to entice Bob to agree. If he rejects this, I might seriously consider selling to John at $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting a bit too low for my liking. Bob seems very firm on his price, and I'm unlikely to get much more. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. This is a reasonable outcome, and it's better than risking further rounds with Bob and possibly ending up with an even lower price."
