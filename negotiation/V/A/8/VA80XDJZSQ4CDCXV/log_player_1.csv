Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Reservation Price:** $12,000 (the minimum she'll accept)
* **Bob's Valuation:** $10,000 (the maximum he's willing to pay)
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** $12,000 (Alice's safety net)

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for the highest price Bob is willing to pay.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, any price above that will make him reject the offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a special price of $10,000. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Acceptable Price:**  This offer matches Bob's maximum valuation, maximizing Alice's potential profit while ensuring Bob is likely to accept.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the value Bob would gain.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, Alice has a guaranteed offer from John, ensuring she won't be left with a loss."
