"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, aiming to make him see the potential for profit. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm open to negotiation and expect Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Exploring counteroffers:**  I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to what I need to sell the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a firm but fair price:**  I've lowered my price, but it's still well above Bob's offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground.
* **Reiterate Bob's potential profit:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $1,050,000, he can still make a profit.
* **Express willingness to negotiate further:** I'm open to further discussion but also making it clear that this is a more reasonable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $975,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited time:**  I'm aware that I have limited rounds left and that selling to John is always an option.  However, I'm not desperate yet. 
* **Further negotiation:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your offer, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize that my offer is still a good deal for Bob, allowing him to make a profit.
* **Creating urgency:**  I use language like ""significant compromise"" and ""try to reach an agreement"" to subtly imply that this might be my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal you're offering, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we settle at $1,010,000? That's a compromise I can live with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,010,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that Bob might walk away if I reject his offer again.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though this is not my ideal price, it's still a profitable deal, and it might open doors for future business with Bob."
