{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay.  You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is still within my budget, it's not the best deal I'm hoping for. I'm going to keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a bit from her original price, but I'm going to try to push for a lower price. I'm offering $110, which is a compromise between my last offer and Alice's current offer. Hopefully, this is enough to convince Alice to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still not willing to go below $130.  It seems like she's not willing to budge much, and her offers are going up and down.  I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. If Alice doesn't come down to a price I'm comfortable with, I might consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is clearly not going to go lower than $120. This is a good compromise, as it's within my budget and only $20 more than my ideal price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Alice to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is getting closer to John's price of $150.  With only a few rounds left, and no indication that Alice will drop below $140, it's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  While I wanted to save more money, getting the product for $150 is still within my budget and a better option than continuing a seemingly unproductive negotiation with Alice."
