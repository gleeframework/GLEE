"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit high for me right now. Considering the value to me and your own valuation, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a significant portion of the value you stand to gain and is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. It's a fair price considering both our perspectives, and it allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
