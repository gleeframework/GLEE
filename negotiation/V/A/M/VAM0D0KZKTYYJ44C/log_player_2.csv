"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and $1,200,000 to Bob.  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob to accept, as he could buy from John for $1,200,000.  Thus, rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price is the best option for Bob."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a significant portion of the value you stand to gain and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than the price Bob is willing to pay. Since Bob can acquire the product from John for $1,200,000, he should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
