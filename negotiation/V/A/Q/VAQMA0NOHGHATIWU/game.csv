"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $1225000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1225000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
