"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase the product for $1,500,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $900,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,050,000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
