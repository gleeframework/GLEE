Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500}

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter in the next round."

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's still a good deal for me, and hopefully, Bob will see the value and come closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but with only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'm concerned we're getting stuck in a stalemate.  John is a secure alternative and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  I'll sell to John."
