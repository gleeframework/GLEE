,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $102.50. Would you be willing to consider this price?",102.5,Bob,4,
