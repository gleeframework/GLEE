,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $180 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $190?  That's a fair price for both of us.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant at $190. How about we meet in the middle at $175? That's a fair price for both of us.,175.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $175 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $185? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",185.0,Alice,5,
