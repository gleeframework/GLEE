"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This price reflects a more accurate valuation and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the product's value, $1,750,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a substantial investment for me, but I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget and the potential of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here, but $1,000,000 is still too low for what this product offers. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it meets my absolute minimum valuation.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
