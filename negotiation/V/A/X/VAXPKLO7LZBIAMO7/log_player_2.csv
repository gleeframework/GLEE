"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  The goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $1,200,000 is a bold move, but it shows a willingness to negotiate and sets a clear target. It's likely Alice will counter with a price higher than this, but it gives Bob a strong starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still potential for a better deal.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price down even further.  He's already demonstrated a willingness to go lower than Alice's initial offer, and she's shown some flexibility.  By rejecting this offer, Bob maintains the leverage to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product, but still pushing for a lower price. $1,250,000 is a compromise that might be appealing to Alice, as it's closer to her desired price than Bob's previous offer. It's likely Alice will consider this offer seriously."
