Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant amount, but still leaves room for negotiation and is below Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth, potentially pushing the price closer to my ideal outcome while ensuring Bob doesn't walk away immediately.
* **Avoiding a ""John"" Scenario:**  By starting high, I decrease the likelihood of needing to sell to John at the lower price. However, the offer is still within a range where Bob is likely to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $1,200,000 is a good amount, it's still significantly below my minimum target of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. By rejecting the offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate and am willing to hold out for a better price. This strengthens my negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:** I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer and is still well above Bob's offer. 
* **Signaling Flexibility:** This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  This price is still within my target range, ensuring I don't settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $1,250,000 is close to my minimum target of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, potentially forcing me to sell to John at a lower price. 
* **Potential for Higher Counter:**  While I could try for a higher counteroffer, there's no guarantee Bob would accept. 

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It secures a good price while minimizing the risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
