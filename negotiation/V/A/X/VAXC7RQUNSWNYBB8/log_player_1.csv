Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your maximum potential profit.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it for the full $150 might immediately discourage Bob, even though it's worth less to him. 

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
