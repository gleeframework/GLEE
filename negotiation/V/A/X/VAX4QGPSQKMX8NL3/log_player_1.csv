"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though we haven't revealed specifics. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This first offer sets the stage for a negotiation where we can gradually concede towards a price that is still very favorable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. You have plenty of room to negotiate and John's offer acts as a strong fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings, in terms of potential ROI and unique features, is substantial. I could consider coming down to $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We've dropped the price by $300,000, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. This large decrease might make him more amenable to increasing his offer. 
* **Reiterating Value:** We're continuing to emphasize the product's intrinsic value to justify the high price point, even without going into specifics.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  We're still significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum, leaving space for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. Anything above that would be a stretch for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's offer, meeting your minimum acceptable price. There's no further gain to be had by continuing negotiations with Bob or waiting for a potentially better offer. Accepting now secures you the best possible outcome in this scenario."
