"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a good deal to encourage Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting high, I create space to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I'm trying to get the best price from Bob, I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob acknowledges the value of the product, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price than Bob's current offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage in the negotiation and demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a sale.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's current offer. I'll emphasize the unique value of the product and the limited availability to encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in my product. While $12,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering the product to you for $13,000.  This price reflects the value you'll receive, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a compromise:**  My counteroffer is a step towards Bob's price while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Framing it as a fair deal:**  I emphasize the value Bob will receive and position the counteroffer as a fair compromise.
* **Building rapport:**  I'm using positive language and expressing appreciation for Bob's interest to keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm still open to selling to John for $15,000, but I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $12,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price than Bob's current offer.  
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage in the negotiation and demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a sale.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'll emphasize the unique value of the product and the fact that I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $15,000.  This will put pressure on Bob to make a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. I'm close to my desired price, and I believe $13,500 is a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product.  Keep in mind that I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $15,000.  Let's make this deal happen â€“ what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** My counteroffer is only $1000 away from Bob's last offer, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value and alternative:** I remind Bob of the product's worth and subtly mention the other buyer to create pressure for him to accept a higher price.
* **Urgency and positive framing:**  I use language like ""make this deal happen"" to create a sense of urgency and emphasize the potential for a win-win situation. 

**Strategy for the next round:** I'm prepared to go down to $13,000, but I'll use the remaining rounds to gauge Bob's willingness to meet in the middle. If he doesn't budge, I'll confidently accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $12,500. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob acknowledges my position and the value of the product, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage in the negotiation. I'm not desperate for a sale and have another buyer willing to pay my desired price.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic and not rush into a deal that is unfavorable to me.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'll highlight the unique value of the product and the limited time remaining in the negotiation to encourage Bob to make a final concession.  I'll also make it clear that I'm ready to walk away if he doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your continued interest.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer the product for $13,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's the best I can do given our remaining time.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options, including selling to John for $15,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm making a final concession, lowering my offer to $13,000, which is only $500 away from Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the alternative:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have another buyer waiting, adding pressure to finalize the deal.
* **Urgency and decision time:** I'm emphasizing the limited time remaining and framing it as a decision point for Bob.
* **Direct and assertive:** I'm being clear about my position and my willingness to walk away if he doesn't meet my price. 

**Strategy for the next round:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll immediately accept John's offer for $15,000. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob is too high, and I'm confident John's offer will provide me with a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've carefully considered your offer and am still interested in purchasing the product. However, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $12,750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** With only two rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob is high, and I'm running out of time to negotiate further.
* **Slight increase, but still low:** While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer provides a guaranteed profit of $15,000, which is more than what I'm likely to get from Bob at this stage. 

**Strategy:** It's time to secure a guaranteed sale and avoid the potential risk of further negotiation with Bob. John's offer is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
