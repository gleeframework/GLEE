Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially capture a larger portion of the surplus value.
* **Value to Bob:** This price is still lower than the value Bob places on the product ($15,000), making it a potentially attractive offer for him.
* **Strategic positioning:** This offer establishes a starting point for negotiation. I can then adjust my price based on Bob's response, potentially securing a price closer to my desired value.

**Important Note:**  I'm using a simple strategy based on a single initial offer. However, in a real negotiation, I would consider other factors like:

* **Bob's perceived value:** How sure am I that Bob values the product at $15,000?
* **My risk tolerance:** Am I comfortable with the risk of Bob rejecting my offer?
* **John's availability:** How soon can I sell to John if Bob rejects my offer?

This initial offer is a starting point for a negotiation, and I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my ideal price:** While $10,000 is better than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, it's still significantly below what I hope to earn. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can likely push Bob closer to my desired price of $12,000, or at least get closer to $11,000.
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, but I'm not desperate for the sale. There's a chance I can secure a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $11,000 and $12,000.  I'll be prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's subsequent response."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and maintain leverage:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $11,000 from my initial $12,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness about the deal. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I can assess his negotiating tactics and adjust my next counteroffer accordingly.
* **Maintaining option to sell to John:** I still have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob continue to stall or go unfavorably. 

By offering $11,000, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while also keeping the pressure on Bob to close the deal."
