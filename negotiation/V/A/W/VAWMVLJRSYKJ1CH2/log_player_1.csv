Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin while leaving room for negotiation.  I'll be watching Bob's response carefully to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  I believe I can likely get a higher price if I counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $160. While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent profit and I'm not confident I can get much higher given Bob's recent counteroffers. I'd rather secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for less."
