"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $500,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $650,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness about buying.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $650,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This is a good price for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's get this done!",800000.0,Alice,5,
