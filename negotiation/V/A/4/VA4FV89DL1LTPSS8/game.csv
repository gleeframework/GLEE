"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,5,
