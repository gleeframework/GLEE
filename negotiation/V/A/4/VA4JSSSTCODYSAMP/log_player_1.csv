{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This allows you to potentially get a higher price through negotiation.
* **It shows your willingness to negotiate:**  By starting with a price slightly below your minimum, you signal to Bob that you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price.

**Important:** This is just a starting point. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $10,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $10,800 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,150? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meet in the middle:** This counteroffer proposes a price that's exactly halfway between your previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($10,800). This signals that you're willing to compromise and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Maintain your position:** While you're moving closer to Bob's price, you're still above your minimum. This demonstrates that you're not desperate to sell and that you value the product.
* **Maintain the conversational tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to continue discussing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to go down to $10900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,900 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low for me.  I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to make one final counteroffer before I decide whether to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,900 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 as a final offer. This is a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** This counteroffer explicitly states that it's your final offer, adding pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Slight compromise:**  While still above your minimum, you're making a small compromise to show your willingness to close the deal.
* **Positive language:**  ""Good deal for both of us"" emphasizes the mutually beneficial aspect of the offer. 
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""finalize the transaction"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.

At this point, you've made several concessions and made it clear that this is your last offer.  If Bob rejects, you can confidently move on to selling the product to John."
