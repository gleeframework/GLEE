"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to sweeten the deal, but I'm not willing to go below this price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000? I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  However, $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we try $700,000? ",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I hope you can understand my position.",900000.0,Alice,5,
