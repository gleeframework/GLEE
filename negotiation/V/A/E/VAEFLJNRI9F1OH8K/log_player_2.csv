"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to sweeten the deal, but I'm not willing to go below this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I hope you can understand my position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a low chance of getting the price down to an acceptable level."
