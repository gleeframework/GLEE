"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $1,300,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000",1350000.0,Alice,3,
