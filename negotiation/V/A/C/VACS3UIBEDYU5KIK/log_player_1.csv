Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to completely undervalue it. Offering it at $100 gives Bob a chance to potentially negotiate down while still leaving a profit margin for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer ensures Alice can sell the product for at least $80. This knowledge allows Alice to be more confident in her negotiation with Bob."
