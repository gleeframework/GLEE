"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a much tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This offer reflects the product's true value while still acknowledging your budget concerns.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $18,000 is still too far out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  While I appreciate your increased offer, the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, but that's my final offer. It represents a significant discount on the true value of this product.",15000.0,Alice,5,
