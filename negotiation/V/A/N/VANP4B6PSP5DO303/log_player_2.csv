Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount. I can do $97.50 for the product. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the price difference is getting small. It's better to accept the deal at $97.50 than risk losing the opportunity and having to pay $120 to John."
