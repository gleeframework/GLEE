"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1500000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1000000 more than what the product is worth to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1150000, which is still a significant discount from the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway again, but I think this is as low as I can go.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1080000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a significant discount from the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $1070000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1070000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $1090000, which is still a good deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
