"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $15000. I'm willing to come down to $16500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $16500, which would be $15750. Can you consider that?",15750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $15750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more. I can do $16200, and that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for a unique product like this.",16200.0,Alice,5,
