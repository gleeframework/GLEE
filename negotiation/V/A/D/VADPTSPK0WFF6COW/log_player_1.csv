Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John, who will pay $120, so I can always walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I'll counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135 as a counteroffer. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, giving him a small discount while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is too low for me.  It's below my minimum acceptable price and I'm not willing to risk a further round of negotiation. It's time to secure the guaranteed $120 from John."
