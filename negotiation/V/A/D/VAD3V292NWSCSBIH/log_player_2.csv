"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely do better.  It's below your maximum budget, but you have room to negotiate.  There's no reason to rush into buying from Alice right away.  You can try to get a lower price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, I'm looking to get a slightly better deal.  I'm happy to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price is too high.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a good price within your budget."
