"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value of this product is quite substantial, and $900,000 wouldn't accurately reflect that.  Could you consider something closer to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
