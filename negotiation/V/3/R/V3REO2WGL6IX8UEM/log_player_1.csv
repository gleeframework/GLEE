Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to propose a counter-offer."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, Alice provides a subtle justification for the high price without revealing her own minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly welcomes a counter-offer, indicating flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Note:**  While Alice has a guaranteed sale with John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome. This strategy balances risk and reward."
