"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $15,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. This is the absolute highest I can go. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
