{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gets him interested without immediately pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $105, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me in the middle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to make a profit, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
