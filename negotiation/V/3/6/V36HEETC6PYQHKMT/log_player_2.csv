# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Even though it's less than what you'd pay John, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($1,200,000).
* **Rejecting and buying from John:** This strategy saves you $250,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer. While it's not the ideal price, it's still the best option given the circumstances."
