Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}

Alice has moved a bit, but I still think I can get a better price. I'll reject her offer and see if I can squeeze out a lower number."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this time. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $700,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you at $725,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit more, and at $725,000 I'm getting a decent deal. While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk she'll walk away, and I'd have to pay John the full $1,000,000. It's better to secure a good price now than risk a worse outcome later."
