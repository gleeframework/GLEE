{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, we have a strong fallback position.  Starting the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to our minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to reframe the price in terms of Bob's potential gain rather than just the cost.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message is framed as a ""proposal"" rather than a final offer, indicating openness to discussion and potential adjustments to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* This offer aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject it. 
* If Bob counters, we can negotiate down, potentially settling around $1,100,000 - $1,200,000, still significantly higher than his initial valuation. 
* If Bob rejects this initial offer, we have the security of John's guaranteed purchase at our desired price."
