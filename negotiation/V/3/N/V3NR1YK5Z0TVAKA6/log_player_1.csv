{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,200,000 as my starting offer. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) but still a substantial profit for me. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.  It highlights the potential benefits for both of us, which may increase his willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to start the negotiation at a point that is both attractive to Bob and still allows me room to negotiate. I'm prepared to accept a lower price than my minimum if it means securing a sale and avoiding the risk of having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to take the quick sale, I believe I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* By rejecting his initial counter, I demonstrate that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fair price. This might encourage Bob to increase his offer.
* I'll closely monitor Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is far below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a substantial discount from my original offer, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counter-offering at $1,000,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a significant discount from my initial offer, making it a more appealing proposal for Bob.
* **Message:** The message is firm but respectful.  I acknowledge Bob's offer while emphasizing that it's unacceptable. I also highlight the discount from my previous offer to encourage Bob to consider my counter-proposal.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground. I'm aiming for a price that's significantly closer to my target but still leaves room for potential negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** Demonstrating flexibility increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** I'm not willing to accept a price far below my minimum. 
* **Encourage a counter-offer:**  By setting a price that's still higher than Bob's, I incentivize him to make a counter-offer, potentially bringing us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counter-offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While it's still below my target, it's a fair compromise, and accepting it allows me to avoid the risk of selling to John for a lower price.

**Strategy:**

* **Weighing the risk vs. reward:** The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Bob might walk away, leaving me with no buyer. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is my best outcome, but the risk of losing that option is significant.
* **Seeking a quick resolution:**  $900,000 is a substantial sum, and accepting it allows me to move on without further delay.

While my ideal outcome would be a higher price, I'm prioritizing securing a sale and ensuring I don't lose the opportunity to sell to John."
