Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) to be made.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for you, while a price too close to $1,200,000 might discourage Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps the tone positive and emphasizes ""mutual benefit."" 
* **The Price:**  $1,350,000 splits the potential profit, giving you a $150,000 gain over your minimum and offering Bob a $150,000 discount from his perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  This assumes Bob is somewhat negotiable. If you have reason to believe he's a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower your price.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a strong long-term relationship with Bob is paramount, a more generous offer might be preferable."
