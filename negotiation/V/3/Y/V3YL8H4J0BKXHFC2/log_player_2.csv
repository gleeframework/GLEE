"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd like to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, as it allows me to make a reasonable profit while also giving you a significant return. I'm open to further discussion if you have any concerns."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This price takes into account the value you place on the product and still allows me to earn a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still outside my budget. I need to continue negotiating and try to get closer to my target price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counteroffer again and potentially secure a more favorable deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while still allowing you to make a profit. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to be more flexible. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This price is closer to my original offer, but still takes into account the value you place on the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $1,050,000 is still over my budget. I need to continue negotiating to push for a lower price.  I'm also aware that I have the option of buying from John for $800,000, which gives me a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While I'm eager to acquire this product, $1,050,000 remains above my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both. I'd like to offer $975,000 for the product. This price represents a significant compromise for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,075,000. This price is still a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin any further. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still beyond my budget. With only a few rounds left, the likelihood of her coming down to my target price is low. I've been negotiating for several rounds and haven't managed to get the price significantly lower.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000.  This ensures I acquire the product while staying within my budget and minimizing risk."
