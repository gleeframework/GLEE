"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd like to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, as it allows me to make a reasonable profit while also giving you a significant return. I'm open to further discussion if you have any concerns.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This price takes into account the value you place on the product and still allows me to earn a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while still allowing you to make a profit. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to be more flexible. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This price is closer to my original offer, but still takes into account the value you place on the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While I'm eager to acquire this product, $1,050,000 remains above my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both. I'd like to offer $975,000 for the product. This price represents a significant compromise for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,075,000. This price is still a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin any further. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
