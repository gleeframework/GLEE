"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a lot of value out of it.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above $120, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $130. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",130.0,Alice,5,
