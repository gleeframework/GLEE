"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $11,500. While it's a better deal than John's $12,000, Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially save more money. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's value ($10,000) as possible.  Offering $10,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable price that might be appealing to Alice. It leaves room for further negotiation while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is only $100 lower than her initial offer, which isn't a significant enough change for Bob to consider accepting.  Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible and should continue to negotiate by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to come down in price. Bob is now offering a price that is more attractive to him but also still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a good compromise that might lead to a deal, but if Alice rejects it, Bob can still go to John for a slightly higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $300 lower than John's price.  The negotiations are not moving quickly enough to make it worth Bob's time to continue. At this point, it is more efficient for Bob to simply buy the product from John for $12,000. He'll save time and avoid further negotiation."
