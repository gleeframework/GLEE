I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good price for both of us. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still gives me a decent profit. It's also higher than the value Bob places on the product, so it's a good deal for him. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll sell it to John for $12,000, but I prefer to make a deal with Bob."
