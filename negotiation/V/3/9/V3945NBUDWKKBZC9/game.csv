"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $1200000 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $1350000? It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1300000? This would allow both of us to get a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
