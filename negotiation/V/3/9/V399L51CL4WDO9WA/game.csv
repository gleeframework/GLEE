"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $12500 to make it worth my while. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",12500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to look at other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise, though - I can meet you at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $10500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $11000, which is $10750. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,,
