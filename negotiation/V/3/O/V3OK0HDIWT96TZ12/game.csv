"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However,  $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a point where we both feel comfortable. How about $1,600,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while recognizing the inherent value of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
