"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know holds significant value for you. My asking price is $1,750,000.  This reflects the unique benefits and potential it offers. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting the value we both see in this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a higher price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership,  $1,400,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the unique value this product offers. I believe this price is still fair considering the potential benefits for you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hoping we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale, and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation or potentially selling to John at a lower price."
