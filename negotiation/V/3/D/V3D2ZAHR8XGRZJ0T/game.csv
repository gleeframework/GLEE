"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you and the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $800,000? That's a firm offer from my side.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $800,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
