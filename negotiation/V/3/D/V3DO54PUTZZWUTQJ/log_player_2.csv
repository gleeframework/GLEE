"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value is worth no less than $800000 to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. It's highly unlikely Alice would accept her stated ""true value"" of $800,000, and we can try to push for a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's true value to me is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a decent price considering John's offer. However, there is still some wiggle room.  Alice's statement about the true value being $800,000 implies she might be willing to go even lower.  It's worth trying to push for a slightly lower price in the next round."

Considering your statement about the product's true value, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which reflects a fair compromise and a significant savings for me compared to John's offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a fair price. However, I'm not willing to budge from my minimum price of $825000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $815000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's bottom line:** Alice has stated $825,000 as her minimum price and has already come down from her initial $900,000 offer. 
* **Your counteroffer:** Your last counteroffer of $800,000 was rejected.
* **Current offer:** Alice's current offer is $815,000, which is very close to your last counteroffer. 
* **John's price:**  The alternative is to buy from John for $1,500,000.

Considering the potential of further negotiations being fruitless, accepting Alice's offer of $815,000 saves you $685,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal for you and likely a fair compromise given Alice's stated minimum."
