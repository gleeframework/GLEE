"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It's clear she's starting high, knowing your potential value. You should counter with a much lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum price ($8,000) to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves plenty of space for Alice to counter, hopefully within a range closer to my budget. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:**  This first counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $5,000 is also quite low considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice came down, but $10,000 is still above your $8,000 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate means there's likely room to go lower.  
* **John's Price is Backup:** You can always fall back on John's $8,000 offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer is a significant jump from $5,000, showing Alice you're serious but also staying within a reasonable range of your $8,000 limit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Offering $7,000 helps gauge how much lower Alice is willing to go. 
* **Compromise Language:** The message emphasizes finding a ""fair compromise,"" encouraging Alice to meet you closer to your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Within Budget:** $9,000 is slightly above your ideal price, but it's within your $8,000 limit.
* **Good Deal:**  You're still saving $3,000 compared to Alice's initial offer and getting the product for $1,000 less than her value.
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  If you push further and Alice rejects it, you might end up having to buy from John at $8,000 anyway. This secures a reasonable deal."
