"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I've done some research and I believe the product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised by offering you $775,000, and now you're asking for another $35,000 off. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a living too. I'll meet you at $760,000.",760000.0,Alice,5,
