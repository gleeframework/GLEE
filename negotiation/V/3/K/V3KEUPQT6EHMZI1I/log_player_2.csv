"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so Alice's offer of $13,000 is too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
``` 
 
This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still a bit above Bob's maximum value. It's a good starting point for negotiation and sees if Alice is willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's maximum value.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 
 
This counteroffer is Bob's maximum value, so it's a fair offer to see if Alice is willing to meet in the middle. If Alice rejects, Bob can always buy from John for the same price."
