I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking further negotiation, as I might not get a better price."
