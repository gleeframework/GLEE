Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}

This counter-offer aims to significantly lower the price, while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

While $85 is better, we can still try to negotiate a bit further before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're moving towards a price that works for us while still acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $75 just yet. I can do $82, which is my best price. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her best price. Accepting at $82 gets us the product at a significant discount from John's $120 price."
