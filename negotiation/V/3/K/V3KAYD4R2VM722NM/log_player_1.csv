Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my asking price and still leaves you a good margin for profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000), giving him incentive to negotiate.**
* **It's lower than my minimum value ($15,000), ensuring I still make a profit.** 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while still setting a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a good deal while ensuring I can make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Is still above Bob's offer:**  I'm not giving in completely.
* **Provides a reasonable middle ground:** $10,500 is closer to Bob's offer than my previous one, but still above his perceived value.

This strategy aims to find a compromise that satisfies both parties while keeping me closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $10,250 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely by rejecting his offer."
