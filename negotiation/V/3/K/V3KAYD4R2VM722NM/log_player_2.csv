"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my asking price and still leaves you a good margin for profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, which gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Strategic Aim:** Our goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally closer to John's $10,000 price. A low starting point increases the chances of reaching a more favorable deal.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  We've left space for Alice to counter-offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also setting a firm lower boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a good deal while ensuring I can make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to John's price, but there's still a $500 difference. We're in a strong negotiating position since we have a backup option. We'll push a bit further to see if we can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?"", 
""product_price"": 10250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's latest offer ($10,500) and our previous offer ($10,000). This tactic often signals a willingness to compromise and reach a deal.
* **Staying Above John's Price:** We're still aiming to pay less than Alice's initial offer while staying slightly above John's price as a negotiating tactic.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will show us if Alice is willing to negotiate further or if she's firm on a price above $10,000."
