"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll find the product more than worth it. Let me know your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $9800? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",9800.0,Bob,4,
