"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $130. It's a fair compromise, considering its value to you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers - I'll offer $120. This is the most I can afford, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $125. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you.",125.0,Alice,5,
