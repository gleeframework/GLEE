"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $800,000. 
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate and can make a counteroffer. 
* It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  You want to start your counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price to establish your desired price range. $750,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Justifying Your Offer:**  You're providing a reason for your counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value to you. This shows you're not just throwing out a random number. 
* **Keeping It Professional:**  The message remains polite and professional, aiming for a collaborative negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is Still High:** While Alice has come down in price, $825,000 is still above your maximum of $800,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** You have 7 rounds left, and you've already established a price range. There's potential to push Alice down further. 
* **John's Price:** While John's price is attractive, you might be able to secure a better deal with Alice. Rejecting this offer gives you more leverage."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and my limited resources. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  State clearly that this is your final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  Remind Alice of the value of the product to you and the limitations of your budget. This subtly reinforces your position. 
* **Be Confident:**  Use confident language to suggest you are serious about closing the deal at this price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is Close, But Not There:**  While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to your budget, it's still outside your maximum price of $800,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 5 rounds left, the time to negotiate further is limited.  
* **John's Price is Guaranteed:** You know for sure that John will sell you the product for your maximum price. It's a safer bet to take the guaranteed deal than risk further negotiation.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Choosing John minimizes the risk of Alice rejecting your final offer in the remaining rounds."
