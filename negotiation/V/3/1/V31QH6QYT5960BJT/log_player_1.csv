"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a higher price.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's exactly my minimum value. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price by negotiating further. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have the option to sell to John for the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer, but still maintaining a margin above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and reach a deal within the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price and I'm willing to accept it.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and then having to sell to John at my minimum.  I'm also aware that I have 6 rounds left and there's a chance I might get a better offer if I keep negotiating."
