Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  This represents a significant value for both of us and allows us to quickly move towards a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably offer right now.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value and allows us to finalize the deal quickly.  Let's make this happen!
