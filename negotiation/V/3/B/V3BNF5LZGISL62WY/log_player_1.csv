Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I appreciate its value, I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

``` 

Bob is offering our minimum acceptable price, and it's unlikely he'll go much higher.  We have a guaranteed offer from John at our desired price, so it makes the most sense to sell to John now."
