Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value to you is significant, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This high price will help gauge Bob's eagerness and the potential for even higher profits.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  The initial offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the high price as a reflection of that value, not just your desire to maximize profit.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, aiming too high could make Bob walk away without countering.  This strategy balances risk and potential reward."
