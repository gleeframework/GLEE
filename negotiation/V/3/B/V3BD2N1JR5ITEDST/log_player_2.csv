"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value to you is significant, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While he values the product, he can get it from John for $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
