"I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $14000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go up to $14000. I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12000, which is my original offer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $13000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
