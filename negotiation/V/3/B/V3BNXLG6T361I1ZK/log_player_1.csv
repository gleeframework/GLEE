"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My asking price is $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but not too high to scare him away. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your recommendation. I would like to counter with an offer of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm going to stick to my initial strategy of trying to close the deal closer to my ideal price.  By coming down a bit from $95, I'm showing Bob I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with an offer of $87 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can squeeze out a few more dollars. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks again for the offer.  I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $88. Is that acceptable to you?"", ""product_price"": 88} 
```

I'm trying to find a compromise and  am coming down to $88.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate."
