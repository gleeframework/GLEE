Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as much from Bob as possible, knowing my minimum is $15,000 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting me closer to my ideal price.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price makes the offer seem more appealing to Bob.

This strategy balances getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring I don't lose the sale to John."
