"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you highlighting its uniqueness. However, $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $110 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
