Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to set a high starting point to maximize my potential earnings. It's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth more than $800,000, so I'm willing to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, I believe I can do better. I'm confident that the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I believe the product holds. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $920,000 is still a good deal.  I've already made a few concessions and don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by pushing for more.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a good profit."
