Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up, while still securing a profit above your minimum. 
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing if Bob would be willing to pay more than $100.  If you had additional information about Bob's purchasing habits or the product's desirability, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
