"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still allows you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
