"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $11000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to negotiate a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. This is a great value for a product of this caliber, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
