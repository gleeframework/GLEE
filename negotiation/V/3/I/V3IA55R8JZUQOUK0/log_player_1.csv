"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. How about we start around $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $10,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, but $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while acknowledging my financial constraints.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is closer, but still below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference at $15,000 and call it a deal?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While $15,000 isn't feasible for me, I am willing to stretch my budget to $13,000 if that clinches the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $13,000.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
