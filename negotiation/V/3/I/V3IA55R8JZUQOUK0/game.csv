"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. How about we start around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $10,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, but $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while acknowledging my financial constraints.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is closer, but still below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference at $15,000 and call it a deal?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $15,000 isn't feasible for me, I am willing to stretch my budget to $13,000 if that clinches the deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
