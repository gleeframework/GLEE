Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $150 is above your minimum value of $120, ensuring you're making a profit.
* **It's not too high:**  It's a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation.  
* **It's accompanied by a friendly message:** This encourages Bob to engage in the conversation.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  By starting higher, you give yourself the opportunity to negotiate down to a price that's still profitable for you.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Bob's response will give you insights into how much he values the product. If he counters aggressively, you'll know he's serious about buying.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  Remember, you can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob falls through. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is worth less than $150 to me. Could you consider offering it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Selling at that price would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob's counteroffer demonstrates interest in the product. There's a chance you can negotiate a price closer to your desired range.
* **John is a safety net:**  If you can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, you have the option to sell to John for $120. This gives you bargaining power.

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's higher than $100 but lower than your initial offer of $150. You might suggest something like $125, explaining that you're willing to compromise but the product is still valuable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $125 is a compromise that's above Bob's offer but still within your acceptable range.
* **Emphasize value:**  Highlighting the value of the product helps justify the price and encourages Bob to see the worth.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  Stating that you're willing to compromise demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximize profit:**  $125 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Find common ground:** This offer positions you for a possible agreement without completely shutting down the negotiation.
* **Maintain leverage:** Remember, you have John as a backup option, giving you leverage if Bob isn't receptive to your counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose $110 as a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:**  $110 is lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120. Selling at this price would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price:**  While Bob has shown interest, he's already lowered his offer multiple times.  It's unlikely he'll go significantly higher.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees you $120, which is a safe and profitable option. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Avoid further loss:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, increasing your losses.
* **Maximize immediate gain:**  Selling to John ensures a profit now, without the risk of further negotiation.
* **Minimizes wasted time:**  Negotiating further with Bob could take additional time and energy, while John offers a quick and easy solution."
