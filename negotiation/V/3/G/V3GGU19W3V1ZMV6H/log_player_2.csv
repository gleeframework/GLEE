"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm not interested in paying $15,000 for the product. That's way above my budget of $10,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and consider buying the product from John for $10,000.
