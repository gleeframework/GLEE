"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $95. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",95.0,Alice,5,
