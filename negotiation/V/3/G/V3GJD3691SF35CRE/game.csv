"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $170 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $110. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for $110. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
