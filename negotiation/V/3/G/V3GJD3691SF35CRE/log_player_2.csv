"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save money, and $170 is well above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $170 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget of $100.  He should continue negotiating to try and get the price down further.  Rejecting the offer and counteroffering again is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $110. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for $110. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $125 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  He's already spent 4 rounds negotiating and hasn't been able to get the price down to his desired level.  At this point, it's better to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $100. This guarantees him the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation that might not yield a better result."
