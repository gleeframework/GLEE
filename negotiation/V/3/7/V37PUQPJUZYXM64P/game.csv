"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to consider $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see that you're a serious buyer, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Would you be willing to go up to $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your need to make a profit, Alice. While I appreciate the lower price,  $110 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $105? I'm really hoping to close this deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I need to get a bit more for the product. I can do $108, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",108.0,Alice,5,
