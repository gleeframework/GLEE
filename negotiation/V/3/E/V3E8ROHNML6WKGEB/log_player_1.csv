Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I believe it's a great deal and will be very useful to you."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 
Here's why this offer is strategic: 
* **Maximizes Profit:**  It aims to get the highest price Bob might be willing to pay before opting for John's guaranteed offer.
* **Appeals to Value:**  The message doesn't just state the price but tries to subtly persuade Bob that the product is worth the slightly higher price than its value to him.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $119, there might be a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very keen on the product, allowing Alice to potentially earn even more."
