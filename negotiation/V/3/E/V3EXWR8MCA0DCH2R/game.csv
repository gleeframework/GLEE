"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, I think $900,000 is a little high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800,000.

I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me.  To be honest, I'm getting close to my limit on this. I'd be willing to pay $810,000, but that's as high as I can go.",810000.0,Bob,6,
