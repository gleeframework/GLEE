"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to ensure I get a good price for the product. My counteroffer is $11,800, which is the highest price I'm willing to consider below my minimum of $12,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11800.0,Alice,5,
