"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $15,000 to you, and to make it worthwhile for both of us, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is cutting it a little too close to my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $12,750? That's the best I can do for now.",12750.0,Bob,4,
