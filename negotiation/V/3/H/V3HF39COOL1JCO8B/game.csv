"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand the value of the product to you,  $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
