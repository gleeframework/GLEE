Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand the value of the product to you,  $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.
