Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, but I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. It's a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit while also being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $13,500, which is closer to my desired price.  While I would prefer a little more, I'm willing to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob. The potential for further negotiation is diminishing, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to settle for John's lower offer."
