{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is well above your minimum, leaving room for potential concessions. It also frames the offer as a valuable opportunity for Bob, encouraging him to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering my budget and the value I think it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still a significant amount below your minimum target of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale quickly, rejecting the offer allows for continued negotiation and potentially reaching a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Show Bob that you are serious about getting your desired price.**
* **Open the door for a counteroffer closer to your target.**
* **Maintain leverage in the negotiation.**

The next counteroffer should aim to bridge the gap between your current position and Bob's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000. That's the highest I can go without breaking my budget. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to your desired price and above your minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal for both of you. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of rejection and having to sell to John for a lower price is high. Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiations."
