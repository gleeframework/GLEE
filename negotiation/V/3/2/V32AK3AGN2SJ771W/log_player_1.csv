Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is a good offer, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can push for a better deal with a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe we can reach a more favorable price with further negotiation.  I'm committed to maximizing my profit and am willing to keep working with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. However, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my ideal, and I believe Bob may be more willing to meet me halfway as we're nearing the middle ground."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is lower than I hoped for,  it's still significantly above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and I need to make a decision.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit that's significantly higher than selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
