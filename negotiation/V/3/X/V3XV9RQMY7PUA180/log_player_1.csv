Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the special price, $800,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This price is a fair reflection of its value to me and still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
