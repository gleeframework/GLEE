"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
