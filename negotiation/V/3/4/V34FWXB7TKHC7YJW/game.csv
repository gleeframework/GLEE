"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. Can you meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit below what I need to consider.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1350000? This would give us both a good deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is still quite a bit below what I need to accept. How about we try $1300000 as a final compromise? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1220000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1280000, but this is my final offer.  It's a good price for both of us and we can move forward with the sale.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
