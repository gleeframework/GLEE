"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for me. Considering the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
