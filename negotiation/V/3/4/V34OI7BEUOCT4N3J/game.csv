"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. Is that something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. I can see you're willing to pay a bit more than $9000, so I'm willing to come down to $11000. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?",11000.0,Alice,5,,

"Hi Bob, I've already told you that I won't go below $12000, and I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my minimum price. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to sell it to someone else. The product is still available for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,7,,
