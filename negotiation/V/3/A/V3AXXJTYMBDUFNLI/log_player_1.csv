"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get close to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm countering with $145. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still slightly lower than I would have liked, it's getting close to my desired price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm also aware that I only have 10 rounds, and I don't want to run out of time."
