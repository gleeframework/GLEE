# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you at $9,700. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $9,700. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal or running out of rounds.  You can get the product for a sure $10,000 from John."
