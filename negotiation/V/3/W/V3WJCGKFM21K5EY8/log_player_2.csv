"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a better price than $12,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still a bit higher than you'd like to pay.  You can likely get it for lower by counteroffering again.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for further negotiation."
