"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value it holds for you while still exceeding my minimum asking price.  I understand you have other options, but I believe this is the most advantageous deal you'll find. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
