You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, it doesn't change the fact that she's offering the product at her own perceived value ($100), which is the maximum you're willing to pay.  

By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of:

* **Alice making a counter-offer:**  She might be willing to lower the price to secure the sale.
* **Sticking with John:** You haven't lost anything by rejecting Alice's offer, as you can still purchase the product from John at your maximum price."
