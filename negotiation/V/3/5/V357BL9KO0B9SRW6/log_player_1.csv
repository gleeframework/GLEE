Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is quite high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still quite far from what I had in mind.  To make this work, I'd need to see a price closer to $750,000. This would be a significant investment for me, but I believe it's fair considering my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering John is offering me the same product at this price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed that John is offering the same product for $800,000. This means Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, it makes no sense to accept Bob's final offer. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and move on to the guaranteed deal."
