"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8,200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,200 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a good price, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $7,800. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,400. This is a fair offer considering the market value and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",7400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $7,400. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,400 and $7,800, which is $7,600. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7600.0,Alice,7,
