"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm starting at $2,000,000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I need to get closer to $1,700,000 to make this deal work for me. Let's split the difference and see if we can find common ground.  What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,700,000. How about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm very close to accepting your offer, but I need to get just a little bit closer to my minimum price.  How about $1,475,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale.",1475000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, but $1,475,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,425,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",1425000.0,Bob,6,
