Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still significantly below what I could get elsewhere.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than what the product is truly worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal and make this a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $900,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer is fair, allowing you to make a worthwhile investment and ensuring I can make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
