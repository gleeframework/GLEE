"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me.  I'm interested in this product but I can't go over $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still significantly below what I could get elsewhere.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet at $950,000?  This would give me room to make this purchase and would still leave you with a good profit margin.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than what the product is truly worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal and make this a win-win situation.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,100,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make this purchase and giving you a respectable profit. Let's find a way to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $900,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer is fair, allowing you to make a worthwhile investment and ensuring I can make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm ready to offer you $925,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Bob,8,
