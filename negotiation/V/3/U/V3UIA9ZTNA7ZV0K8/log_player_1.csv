Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,500,000 (John's offer) as possible while still making the deal attractive to Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Offering it at that price might be too low and raise suspicion. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $1,400,000 gives Bob a perceived ""deal""  (saving $100,000 from John's offer) while still netting Alice a significant profit. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Bob might try to negotiate, and Alice can then decide if she wants to lower the price slightly or stick to her guns knowing she has John as a backup buyer."
