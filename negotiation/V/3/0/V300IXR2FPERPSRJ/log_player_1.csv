Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire your product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming to secure a price that reflects the value I'm bringing to this deal.
