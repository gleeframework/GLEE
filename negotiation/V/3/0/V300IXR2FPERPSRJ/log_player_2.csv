"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire your product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm not going to give it away. I'm proposing $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both live with. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming to secure a price that reflects the value I'm bringing to this deal. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise between our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,280,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's aim for a win-win outcome here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a strong incentive to accept this offer. It's lower than John's price, and further negotiation might lead to a higher price or deadlock.  Here's why it's a good strategy:

* **Potential for deadlock:**  Alice is already at a fairly low price, and further negotiation could stall the deal, leaving Bob with no product. 
* **Time constraint:** With only 5 rounds remaining, time is running out to secure the product at a good price.
* **Value difference:**  Even though there's still a gap between Alice's price and Bob's ideal, the difference is small enough that the risk of losing the product is too high. 

By accepting this offer, Bob gets the product for a decent price and avoids the risk of further negotiation going sour."
