"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that the product has a lot of value to you. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle on $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. Let's try $1,012,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but that's still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $993,750?",993750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. Let's try $1,007,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to give you a good deal.",1007500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we make this our final offer - $998,125. That's a fair deal for both of us.",998125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. Let's try $1,005,000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to give you a good deal. After this, I'll have to consider other options.",1005000.0,Alice,9,
