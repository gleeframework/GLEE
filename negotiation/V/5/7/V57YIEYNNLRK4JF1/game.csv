,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay as close to my target price as possible.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $113 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that respects both of our needs. What do you say?",113.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $111? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",111.0,Bob,6,
