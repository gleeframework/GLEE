{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product.  This creates room for bargaining and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay as close to my target price as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $112 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $113 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that respects both of our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 113}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $111? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is very close to my minimum,  it's still below my desired price point. I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement.  It's best to sell to John at this point and avoid further negotiations."
