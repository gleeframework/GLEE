"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $13,000, knowing the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Fairness:** While I want the best price, I'm not starting outrageously high.  This makes my initial offer seem reasonable and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This gives us both room to adjust the price throughout the 10 rounds without feeling like we're giving too much away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for More:** While $11,000 is better than my minimum of $10,000, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired $13,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going.  I want to see if I can push him further.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in Round 2, so I need to be cautious about accepting offers that are too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000. That's still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from $13,000 to $12,000, but not by too much.
* **Keeping Pressure:** I'm still pushing for a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Staying Positive:** My message remains friendly and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in Round 4.  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob increases.
* **Close to My Minimum:** While $10,500 is my minimum acceptable price, it's only $500 away.  I'm still gaining profit.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $10,000 is looming.  Accepting Bob's offer at $10,500 secures a better deal."
