"Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1900000. Let's try to find some common ground. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1900000 is still above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1700000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1700000 is still below what I can accept. Let's meet halfway - I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1800000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1600000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
