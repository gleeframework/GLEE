"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. Let's try to find some common ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While I'm starting to feel pressure, I'm still not willing to sell for that low of a price. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by counteroffering."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,700,000 is still below what I can accept. Let's meet halfway - I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1800000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1600000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob or potentially losing the deal altogether."
