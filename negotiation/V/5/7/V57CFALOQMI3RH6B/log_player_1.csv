Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. However, the message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to create a sense of scarcity and desirability. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates urgency, potentially leading Bob to accept a higher price than he initially intended.

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob rejects the offer, but the potential for a higher sale price justifies the attempt."
