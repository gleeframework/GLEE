"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider something closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000, but I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?"
"I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,,
