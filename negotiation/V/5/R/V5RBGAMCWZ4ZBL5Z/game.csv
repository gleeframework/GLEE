"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. How about $800,000?  That would be a significant savings for me and I believe a fair price for the value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
