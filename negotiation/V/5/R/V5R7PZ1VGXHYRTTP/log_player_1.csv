Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. How about $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is lower than Bob's perceived value but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation, but also shows that I am serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is worth more than that to me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll consider your latest offer of $9,000. However, I still believe that $8,000 would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at that amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob has repeatedly stated his firm price of $8,000. While this is my minimum, I'm not confident I can convince him to go higher.  John offers a guaranteed $8,000, so it's the safer and more predictable option to sell to him."
