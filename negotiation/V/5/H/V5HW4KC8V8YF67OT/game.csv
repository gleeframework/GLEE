"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $14,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product will bring to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $14,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a deal, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
