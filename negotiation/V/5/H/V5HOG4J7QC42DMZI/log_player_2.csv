"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product for $14,000. It's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to explore a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $11,500 right now.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** I'm starting with a fairly low counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to move closer to my target price.
* **Show Interest:** I emphasize my interest in the product to build goodwill and make Alice more likely to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (budget constraint) to make it seem less arbitrary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating, but I'll need to be careful not to go too much higher. I also have the option to buy from John for $12,000, so I have a fallback if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $12,500 is still a bit above where I can go right now. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This would allow us both to walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This strategy highlights that I'm willing to compromise and suggests a fair price.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** Emphasizing that both parties will be happy with the deal increases the chances of acceptance.
* **Final Offer?** This is a strong indication that I'm serious about buying at this price, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
