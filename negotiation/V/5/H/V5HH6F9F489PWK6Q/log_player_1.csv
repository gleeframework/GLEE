Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still lower than John's offer. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies flexibility, leaving the door open for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Selling to John immediately would guarantee me $150, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $115?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a significant move from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  $115 is closer to my minimum and still provides a good profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and open tone, encouraging Bob to continue the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $60 is a bit low.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:**  I believe I can still push for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While selling to John would guarantee $150, I want to explore if I can secure a better deal with Bob."
