"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $92.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",92.5,Bob,4,
