Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a unique item with a lot of potential. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:**  This price is a good starting point because it's higher than your minimum value but allows room for negotiation. 
* **The message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the product's potential. 
* **The ""product_price"":**  This is clear and easy for Bob to understand.

**Why this approach?**

* **Negotiation:**  A higher starting price gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Potential for more profit:** You're aiming for a higher sale price than John's offer. 
* **Positive attitude:** A friendly message can help build rapport with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. You may want to adjust your offer based on Bob's reaction and any information you gain about his potential valuation of the product."
