"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's below his maximum price of $10,000, he can likely get a better deal. By rejecting, he opens the opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy it now."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that you're ready to buy it now. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his maximum price of $10,000. He has the option to buy from John for $10,000, so it's not worth risking paying more to Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,500. I'm ready to buy the product at this price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
