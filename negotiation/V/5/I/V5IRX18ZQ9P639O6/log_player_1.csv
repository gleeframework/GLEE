{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, so he has incentive to negotiate and potentially agree to a price closer to your ideal price. 
* **It's a fair offer:** It demonstrates you're open to negotiation but also confident in the product's value."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a bit high, but I'm still interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While $1,100,000 is still a good profit, it's worth trying to negotiate further. Bob clearly values the product, and there's still room for him to go higher.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going."

Bob's offer:

While $1,080,000 is a decent offer, it's still below the price you were aiming for. You can still try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob. Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer will keep the negotiation open."

The negotiation has stalled, and Bob is unwilling to budge. At this point, it's best to cut your losses and sell to John for $800,000.  While it's not your ideal price, it's still a significant profit and avoids risking further negotiation with Bob."
