"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $7,000 is a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8,000.  That would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
