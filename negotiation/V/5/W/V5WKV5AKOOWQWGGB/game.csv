"Bob, I understand your position. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer of $13,000. How about we split the difference at $12,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,000, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
