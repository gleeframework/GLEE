Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already getting more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so there's potential for a counteroffer that might get you closer to $15,000.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes fairness and leaves the door open for dialogue. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings, so be prepared to negotiate and potentially counter Bob's offer. You also have the safety net of John's $10,000 offer if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $11,000 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly less than the product's value to Bob. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay more than $10,000, indicating there's room for a counteroffer that could get you closer to your target price.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  Selling to John at $10,000 is a safety net, but we'll try to maximize our earnings with Bob first.

**Next Step:** We'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to our initial offer of $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer of $13,000. How about we split the difference at $12,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Fairness:** Splitting the difference between your original offer and Bob's offer appears fair and could lead to a quicker agreement.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message reiterates that the product is still a great deal for Bob even at $12,000.

This counteroffer provides a reasonable middle ground and may be more appealing to Bob than your previous offer. It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,000, so how about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $11,500 is only $500 away from your initial offer and significantly closer to your target than John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While a higher price is always desirable, continuing the negotiation might not lead to a substantial increase.  There's a risk that Bob might walk away, forcing you to settle with John.
* **Time Factor:**  Each round of negotiation takes time. Accepting this offer allows you to finalize the deal quickly and move on.

While you might be tempted to continue negotiating, it's important to weigh the potential gain against the risk of losing the sale altogether.  Accepting $11,500 ensures you earn more than your minimum and secures the deal with a buyer who values the product highly."
