"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,100,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
