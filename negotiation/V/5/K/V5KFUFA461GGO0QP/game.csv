"While I appreciate the offer, $1,800,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However,  $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,550,000, and I think that's a fair compromise considering your desired price. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
