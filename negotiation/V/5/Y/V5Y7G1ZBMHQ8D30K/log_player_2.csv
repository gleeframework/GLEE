"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to my $80 limit.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit too pricey for me right now. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That way we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $82.50 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a bit further, but I need to be mindful that John's offer is only $2.50 less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that, Alice.  I could maybe go up to $70, but that's really my limit."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```"
