"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Reasoning:  Bob wants to pay as little as possible, and Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me. Would you consider $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Reasoning:  Bob is still trying to save money and Alice's offer is higher than his ideal price.  He can still try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While I understand your position, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to accept $10,850 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

``` 

Reasoning:  Alice's final offer is $10,850, which is still below Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's a better deal than buying from John, and it's likely Alice won't go any lower. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money and acquire the product."
