"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit off.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I have already lowered my price significantly. I'm willing to accept $825,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.",825000.0,Alice,5,
