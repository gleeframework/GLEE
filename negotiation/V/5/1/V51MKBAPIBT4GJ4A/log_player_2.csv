Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I have already lowered my price significantly. I'm willing to accept $825,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.

Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is the best option at this point."
