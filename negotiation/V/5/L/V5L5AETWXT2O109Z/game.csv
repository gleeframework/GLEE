"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I understand that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I can do $9,250, which is a bit closer to my original price, but still a good compromise. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",9250.0,Alice,5,
