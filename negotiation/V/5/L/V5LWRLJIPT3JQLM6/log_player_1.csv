"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still a good value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $850,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $950,000, which is still a great price for a product worth significantly more. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the potential for both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to sell at that price. I want to see if I can push for a higher offer before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm eager to finalize this deal, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $910,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $910,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still willing to hold out for a bit more. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob and still have John as a backup option. I'll counteroffer one last time to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $915,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 915000}
