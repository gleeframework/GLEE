"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still a good value for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $950,000, which is still a great price for a product worth significantly more. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the potential for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm eager to finalize this deal, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $910,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think?",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $915,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",915000.0,Alice,7,
