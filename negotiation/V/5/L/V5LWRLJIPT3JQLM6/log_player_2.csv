"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still a good value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $950,000, which is still a great price for a product worth significantly more. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He has a few reasons to reject the offer:

* **Save More:** Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $800,000.
* **Potential for Lower Price:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate further and potentially get a price closer to his desired range.
* **John as an Option:** Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, who's offering a lower price. This gives Bob leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the potential for both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget. He has a few reasons to reject the offer:

* **Save More:** Bob wants to try and secure a price closer to $800,000.
* **Negotiating Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer gives Bob more leverage to push for a lower price in the next round.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, offering a significantly lower price. This allows Bob to take more risks in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm eager to finalize this deal, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $910,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $915,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a critical point in the negotiation.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to his ideal price, it's still above his budget and only one round remains. Considering the following:

* **Limited Time:** Only one round left, making it unlikely he can secure a lower price.
* **Guaranteed Deal:**  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product for his maximum budget. 
* **Potential Risk:**  Rejecting and counter-offering again could lead to Alice accepting John's offer, leaving Bob with no product.

Therefore, buying from John is the safest and most rational decision to guarantee Bob gets the product within his budget."
