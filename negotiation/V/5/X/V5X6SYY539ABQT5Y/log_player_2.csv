"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a negotiation and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob can likely negotiate further and potentially get a better price.  He has 7 rounds remaining and can always buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $12,000.  I think this is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this price is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but $13,500 is still above his budget. Bob can likely negotiate further and potentially get a better price. He has 5 rounds remaining and can always buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further in price, but $13,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to you and my maximum budget.  Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $13,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering it to you for $13,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I hope this compromise works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down in price, but $13,250 is still above Bob's budget. With only 3 rounds left, the odds of reaching a deal at $12,000 or lower are diminishing. It's more efficient for Bob to buy from John at this point, ensuring he gets the product at his desired price."
