"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $800000. I'm willing to consider a counteroffer, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
