"Round 1
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting at a reasonable price but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if I can get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much wiggle room there is. This leaves me space to negotiate upwards if needed."

Round 3

Alice is coming down, which is good. I'll reject this offer but propose a price closer to her offer to signal I'm willing to compromise if she negotiates further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $95? That's a fair price."",

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
