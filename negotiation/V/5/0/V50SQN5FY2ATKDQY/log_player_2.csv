# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product, which is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is better than buying from John, but you can do better. You can try to negotiate with Alice or see if there are other sellers offering a lower price."
