Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still potentially exceeding your minimum price. 
* **Confidence and Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your $15,000 goal."
