Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now within a reasonable range.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's a significant improvement and likely the best I'll get from her. It's also only $50,000 more than John's price, and the negotiation process might take more time and effort.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
