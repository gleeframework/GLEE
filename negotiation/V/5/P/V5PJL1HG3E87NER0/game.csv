"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to do?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident you'll find this price fair and still a great value for the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $90. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $85, so I'll offer $87.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",87.5,Bob,6,
