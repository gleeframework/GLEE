"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

While $15,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above your budget. You can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to your goal of $10,000."
