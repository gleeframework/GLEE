"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price in that range?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000. If that doesn't work, I might have to look elsewhere for this product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
