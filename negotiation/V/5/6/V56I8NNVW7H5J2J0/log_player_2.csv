"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120.  You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  $125 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $132.50 is closer to your maximum budget, it's still above it. You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering again, especially since Alice seems willing to negotiate."
