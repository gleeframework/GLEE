Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly below my minimum value ($150) but leaves room for negotiation, and it's also above Bob's perceived value ($120), giving him an incentive to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  $125 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still below my minimum value of $150, it's getting close.  I'm willing to accept Bob's offer as it's a reasonable price considering the negotiation process and his budget constraints. It's better than selling to John for $150, and I can always try to get a better price next time."
