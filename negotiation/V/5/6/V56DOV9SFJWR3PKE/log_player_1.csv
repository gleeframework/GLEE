Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $150 is above your minimum of $120, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's not too high:** You don't want to scare Bob off with an unreasonable price right away. 
* **It includes a friendly message:** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

Let me know how Bob responds, and we'll adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to keep the price within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's tempting to accept Bob's offer since it's your minimum. However,  we're still early in the negotiation, and there's potential to get a higher price. 

We'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

Here's why we chose this counteroffer:

* **Compromise:**  We're showing Bob that we're willing to negotiate by meeting him halfway between our previous offer ($150) and his offer ($120).
* **Maintain Value:** $135 is still significantly higher than our minimum of $120, so we're not giving away too much.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message remains positive and encouraging, which helps keep the negotiation amicable. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
