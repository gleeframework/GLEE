"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, and I do think this product is valuable. However,  $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer you $700000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.
