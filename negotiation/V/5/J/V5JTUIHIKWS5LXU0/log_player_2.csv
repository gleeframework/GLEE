"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still possible to save more money.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, and I do think this product is valuable. However,  $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer you $700,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a good price considering the product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  There is a potential for further negotiation, but accepting the offer secures the product at a significant discount compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
