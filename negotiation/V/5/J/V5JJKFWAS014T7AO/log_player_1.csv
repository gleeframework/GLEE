Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's less than my minimum.  There's no point in further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price."
