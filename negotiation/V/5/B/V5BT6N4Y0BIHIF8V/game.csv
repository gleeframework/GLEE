"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a competitive price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I can offer you a compromise at $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $1050000 for it,  which is a good compromise between our positions.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I can offer you a slight concession at $1080000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
