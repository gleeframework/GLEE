"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise at $1100000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1100000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to meet you at $1050000. This is a fair price that would allow us both to make a reasonable deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm willing to compromise at $1080000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
