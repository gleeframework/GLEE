"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $12000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $15500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but I need to be closer to my minimum price.  I'm willing to drop to $14250. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product a valuable asset. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,7,
