"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the worth of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $15,500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $15500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $13750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $13,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not convinced it's a good deal for me.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, how about $13875?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,875

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although we're getting closer, I'm still not convinced $13,875 is a good deal for me. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to get a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but I need to be closer to my minimum price.  I'm willing to drop to $14,250. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product a valuable asset. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $14250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, how about $13750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  

We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and the remaining rounds are unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk getting less from Bob."
