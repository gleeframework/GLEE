"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This allows me to see if he's truly interested and to gauge where he's willing to start. It also sets the stage for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Even though I only have 6 rounds left, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still have a significant margin for negotiation.  It's important to keep Bob engaged and show that I'm not just holding out for my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I have only 4 rounds left, I'm still not going to accept Bob's offer. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,000,000.  With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to signal my willingness to make a deal.  However, I'm still holding firm on a price above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've only got two rounds left. Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his price, and I'm concerned I won't be able to get a better offer in the remaining time.  While I'd prefer to sell the product for more,  $1,200,000 from John guarantees me a fair price and a guaranteed sale."
