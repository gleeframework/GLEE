"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay, but I understand value can vary. Given its significance to me, I'm looking to receive at least $100 for it. Would you be interested in discussing this further? Considering its value to you, I'm open to negotiation. Let's aim for a fair deal that respects both our perspectives. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
