"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a great compromise, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  How about we settle on $14,000? That's a good compromise for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",15500.0,Alice,5,
