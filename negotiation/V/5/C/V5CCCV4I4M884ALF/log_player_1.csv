"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price than John's $8,000 offer.  I'm aiming for the highest possible profit, but I also need to be realistic and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800. This is a small compromise from my initial offer, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a price that's still higher than John's offer, so I'm not losing any money if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,300 is still a decent profit, and I'm running out of time.  There's a risk that his counteroffers will continue to go down, and I could end up with less than John's offer. It's better to secure a good profit now rather than risk getting a lower price or losing the sale altogether."
