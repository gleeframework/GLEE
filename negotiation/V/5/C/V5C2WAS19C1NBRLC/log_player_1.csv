```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a profit.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as it's higher than Bob's minimum value but leaves potential for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $950,000 is too far below my minimum value and leaves me with no profit. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still a good profit for me. I believe this price is fair considering Bob's offer and the fact that I could walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's very close to the price I could get from John. It's also likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will either lower his offer further or walk away."
