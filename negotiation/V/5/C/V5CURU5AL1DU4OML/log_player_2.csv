"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value to me. Given its importance, I believe it's worth more than just monetary exchange. However, for the sake of transaction, I propose a price of $9,500 for this product. This amount reflects not only its market value but also the emotional and personal significance it holds for me. I understand its worth to you is $8,000, but my offer aims to bridge the gap between our perceived values while ensuring a fair deal for both parties. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss alternative arrangements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, which is significantly less than Alice's $9,500 asking price."
