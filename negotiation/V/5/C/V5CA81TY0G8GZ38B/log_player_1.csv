Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $700,000 is too low for me. I believe I can get closer to my target price if I continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go any lower than $820,000. This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 820000}

While $760,000 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise that works for both of us."
