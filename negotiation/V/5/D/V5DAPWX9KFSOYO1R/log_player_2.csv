"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It's valued at no less than $12000 for me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'd like to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is a bit too low for me given the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget, but it's getting closer.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500?  This is the absolute highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 12500}
