"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I think the product's value is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I'll offer it to you for $11,750. It's a small step down from my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's quality.",11750.0,Alice,5,
