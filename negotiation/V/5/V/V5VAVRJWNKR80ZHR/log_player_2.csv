"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $180 is far above your $100 limit and even higher than her own value for the product. John offers you a much better deal at $100."
