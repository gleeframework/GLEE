{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if I can get a better price before resorting to John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  $1,300,000 is my best price right now.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, as you know the product is worth significantly more to you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target, and I still have some room to negotiate.  I'm going to try a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my ideal price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a great deal for you, and allows us to come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether or needing to pay John's higher price is too great.  It's time to accept and move on."
