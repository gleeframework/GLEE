"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your bottom line is $800,000.  Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $850,000. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000.
