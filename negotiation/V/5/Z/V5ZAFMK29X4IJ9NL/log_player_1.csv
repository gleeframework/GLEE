Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest in working with me. However, $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects the fair market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and the opportunity it presents.  I'm confident this is a price that's fair for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
