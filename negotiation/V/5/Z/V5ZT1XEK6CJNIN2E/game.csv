"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's the best I can do for now.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else.",8875.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to walking away, but I'm still willing to make one more offer. I can do $8,750, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",8750.0,Bob,6,
