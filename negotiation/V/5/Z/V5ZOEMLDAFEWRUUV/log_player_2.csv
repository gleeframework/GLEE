"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if I can get a better deal.  There are 9 rounds left, and I can always go with John's offer if things don't work out with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to close the gap quickly.  $7,000 is still a good deal for me, and it leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to compromise a bit to avoid losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and the chance of running out of rounds makes accepting her offer the best strategy.  I've saved $800 compared to buying from John."
