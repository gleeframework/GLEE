Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $120. It's a great deal you won't want to miss!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $80, it's best to start with a price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $120 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John provides leverage. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential willingness to pay more than his initial valuation."
