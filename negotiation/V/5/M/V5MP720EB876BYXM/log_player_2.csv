"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $100, but Alice is asking for $90. 
* **John's offer is your fallback.**  While you'd prefer to pay less, John's price of $100 is still within your budget. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate with John or see if another seller comes along with a better price."
