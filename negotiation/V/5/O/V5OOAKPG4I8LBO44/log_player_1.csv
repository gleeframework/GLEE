"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's find a middle ground,  I think we can both be happy with this price. "", ""product_price"": 135}
