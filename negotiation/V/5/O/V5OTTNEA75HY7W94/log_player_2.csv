# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds significant value to me, but I understand its potential worth to you might be even greater. After careful consideration, I propose to sell it to you for $1,350,000. This price reflects a strategic balance between maximizing my return and offering you a competitive advantage over other potential buyers. I believe this is a fair and attractive offer that allows both parties to benefit. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product for as much as possible, ideally closer to your maximum of $1,500,000. 
* **Your Maximum:** You're willing to pay $1,500,000, but you want to save money. 
* **John's Price:** John acts as your safety net, ensuring you can still get the product.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high.  This might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $1,200,000. If she doesn't budge significantly, you can always buy from John."
