{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, focusing on the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation process open.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware that Bob might reject the offer, so I'm ready to move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I can use this as an opportunity to push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price, I'm ready to sell to John and secure a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer.  However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason and fairness.
* **Maintain High Price:**  $9,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, maximizing my potential earnings. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm still leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied with this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,000 is closer, I can't quite meet that. How about $7,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $7,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Continued Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag the process on and there's no guarantee he'll come closer to my desired price.
* **Secure a Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me a sale at $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is the best option to maximize my profit and avoid potential further losses in negotiation."
