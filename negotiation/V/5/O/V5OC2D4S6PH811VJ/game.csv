,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm thinking of a price around $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer. I'm getting close to considering John's offer of $1,000,000.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
