Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,200. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that this shows Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'm also still hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's only $800 below my minimum price.  Given that we only have two rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the sale to John."
