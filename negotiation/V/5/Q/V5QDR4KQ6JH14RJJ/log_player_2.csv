"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he should aim for a price lower than $14,500. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm going to need to come in lower than that.  How about $13,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  
* **Focus on compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a price that works for both parties, suggesting flexibility.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $13,500 is still above Alice's minimum value of $12,000, giving her space to counter without losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a price we can both agree on. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:**  While $14,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, indicating there's likely more room to lower the price.
* **Avoiding John for now:**  Bob can still get a better deal than John's $15,000, so there's no immediate need to switch sellers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit high. Let's split the difference and go with $13,750.  I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:**  This counteroffer is another step closer to Bob's target price.
* **Appealing to a middle ground:**  The message emphasizes finding a compromise by suggesting a price halfway between the previous offers.
