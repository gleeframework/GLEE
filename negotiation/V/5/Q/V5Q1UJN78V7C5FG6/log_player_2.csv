"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $9,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation as Alice is likely willing to lower the price to get a sale.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiation fails, Bob can always purchase the product from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** The counteroffer is $1,500 less than Alice's offer, which is a significant amount, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Focuses on a specific price:** Providing a concrete price makes the counteroffer more serious and shows Bob is ready to deal.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and acknowledges Alice's offer, making it more likely she'll be receptive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While closer to Bob's target, $8,250 is still more than the product is worth to Bob.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** Alice is already showing flexibility, suggesting that a lower price is possible.
* **John's offer remains a strong alternative:** If negotiations don't get Bob a better price, he has a guaranteed way to buy the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,250 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  Bob is now offering his maximum price, making it clear that this is his final offer. 
* **Emphasizes fairness:**  The message focuses on a fair price for both parties, aiming to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning being ready to close the deal adds a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to accept."
