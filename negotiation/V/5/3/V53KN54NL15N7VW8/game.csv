"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's still a great price for this product, and I think it's fair for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that!  However, $8,250 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $8,375. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still being a great deal for you. What do you say?",8375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to offer $8,125.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",8125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I can't quite go down to $8,125, but how about $8,200?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",8200.0,Alice,7,
