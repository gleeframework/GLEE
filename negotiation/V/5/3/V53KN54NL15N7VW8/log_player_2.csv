Round 2

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's still a great price for this product, and I think it's fair for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that!  However, $8,250 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $8,375. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still being a great deal for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,375 is getting closer to your ideal price, you're still within your negotiation window and have room to push for a better deal. You know John will sell you the product for $8,000, so there's no need to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to offer $8,125.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 8125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're continuing with the negotiation strategy of meeting in the middle. By counter-offering with $8,125, we're showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but holding firm to getting a price closer to our ideal $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer!  I can't quite go down to $8,125, but how about $8,200?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,200 is a reasonable compromise. While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, or you might waste valuable time in further negotiations. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product for a price that's within your budget and avoids the risk of missing out entirely."
