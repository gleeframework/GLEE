"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm looking for a price of $10,000 to make this a worthwhile deal for me. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is too low for me to consider. This product is worth a significant amount to the right buyer. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $9,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,250, which is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further back-and-forth.",8250.0,Bob,4,
