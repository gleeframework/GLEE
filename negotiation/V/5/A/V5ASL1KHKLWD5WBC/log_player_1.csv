Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

Here's why I chose this price:

* **Maximizing Profit:** This price allows me to earn $150,000 more than selling to John, which is a significant gain. 
* **Appealing to Bob:**  The price is still significantly less than the value Bob places on the product ($1,200,000), giving him a good deal and incentive to accept.

This offer balances the desire for a high profit with the need to ensure Bob finds it attractive enough to accept."
