"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
