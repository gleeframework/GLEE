Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking. This product holds value for me, but not at that price point. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,000,000 walk-away point. You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price.  

At this point, the risk of Bob not meeting your valuation outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer in the next two rounds."
