Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm afraid $1,280,000 is still above my budget. I've been willing to compromise throughout our negotiation, but I've reached my limit. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,220,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He's made it clear that $1,220,000 is his ""final offer.""  Accepting this would mean a loss of $280,000 compared to John's offer. 

While continuing negotiations is possible, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. It's a better business decision to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
