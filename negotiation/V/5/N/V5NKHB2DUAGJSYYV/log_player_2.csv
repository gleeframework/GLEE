"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I know it's worth a lot to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation with a significant price reduction, showing Bob's serious intent to get a good deal.
* **Within Budget:**  $7,500 is still within Bob's maximum budget, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:** Bob provides a reason for the counteroffer (budget), making it more than just a random number."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his desired price.  There's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price and potentially close the deal within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm ready to pay $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is now stating his absolute maximum price, showing his seriousness.
* **Strong Justification:** He reiterates the importance of closing the deal.
* **Pressure:** This puts the ball back in Alice's court, forcing her to decide whether to accept or risk losing the deal."
