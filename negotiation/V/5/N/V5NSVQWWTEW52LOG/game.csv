"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $10,000, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. This price is reasonable for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. ",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,200. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11200.0,Alice,5,
