"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I've assessed it at and the potential benefits it will bring to my business.  Let's start with this and see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 undervalues the product significantly. It's a unique offering with the potential to transform your operations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair balance between the product's potential and the cost I'm willing to invest.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
