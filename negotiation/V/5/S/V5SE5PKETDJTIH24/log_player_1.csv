{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least that much to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product is worth $12,000 to you, so I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,500. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my absolute minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm confident that I can do better by continuing to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This still leaves room for you to get a great deal, and it's a price I can live with. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $12,000, which is the maximum I am willing to pay for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation, which could potentially lead to no sale or a lower price."
