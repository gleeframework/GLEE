"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, a price that's fair to both of us. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,050,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 still undervalues the product. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,100,000. This price is reasonable and fair, allowing us both to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
