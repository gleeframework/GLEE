Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, a price that's fair to both of us. Let's find common ground and close this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your need for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 still undervalues the product. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,100,000. This price is reasonable and fair, allowing us both to walk away satisfied.

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Negotiation:** We've successfully brought the price down by $200,000 from her initial offer.
* **Beating the Alternative:** This price is significantly lower than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of Overplaying:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks Alice walking away or hardening her position. It's better to secure a good deal now."
