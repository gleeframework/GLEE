"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,000,000,  I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, a price that's fair to both of us. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,050,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still close a deal with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your need for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 still undervalues the product. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,100,000. This price is reasonable and fair, allowing us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
