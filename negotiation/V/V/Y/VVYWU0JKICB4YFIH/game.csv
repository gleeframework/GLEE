"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset worth significantly more to you than to anyone else. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing you to acquire it at a substantial discount while still ensuring I receive a generous return.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to pay $800,000 if you decline.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
