"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference at $8,250?  That would give you a good price while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Would you consider $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
