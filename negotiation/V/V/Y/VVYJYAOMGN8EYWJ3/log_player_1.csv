"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value. I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference at $8,250?  That would give you a good price while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can do better with further negotiation.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Would you consider $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
