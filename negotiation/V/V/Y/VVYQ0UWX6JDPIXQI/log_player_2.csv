"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something that's really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $120 is still too high for him, as he values the product at $150. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit high.  He has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there are still rounds left. By rejecting, Bob can continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm getting closer to where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise! However, I'm still a bit short on the profit margin I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $107.50. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been pushing for a lower price, and Alice has also shown willingness to compromise. $107.50 is a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $150 and it is a significant discount from the original price. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but it's also risky - Alice might become less willing to negotiate further, or Bob might run out of rounds and have to buy from John.  Accepting the offer at this point is the safest and most likely way for Bob to secure the product at a good price."
