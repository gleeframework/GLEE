"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? I believe that's a fair price that considers the value I place on it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think takes into account your valuation of the product while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $950,000? I'm trying to find a middle ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, this product is valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we split the difference and land at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.
