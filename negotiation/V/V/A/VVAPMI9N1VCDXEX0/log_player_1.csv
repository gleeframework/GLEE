"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $100 right now. Would you consider lowering the price to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept. There's no room for negotiation left to make a profit. I can get the same price from John without wasting time on further negotiation."
