Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, and this offer is a great opportunity to acquire it."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Attractive to Bob:** Offering the product at $14,000 is still a significant profit margin for you while being below Bob's perceived value of $12,000.  This makes it more likely for Bob to accept.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, there's some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a slightly lower price. You can always go down a bit, but don't go below your $15,000 minimum."
