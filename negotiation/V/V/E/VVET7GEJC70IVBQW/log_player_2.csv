"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000). There's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further.  Bob should try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $1400000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1300000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your willingness to pay a premium for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant savings:** Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still $200,000 below Bob's maximum value. This represents a considerable saving.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice will become firm and refuse to budge, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time consideration:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time, which could be valuable to Bob.

Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity entirely."
