Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 to match what John offers.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product for $140 leaves room for Bob to accept and still get a good deal (saving $10), while you maximize your potential profit (earning $20 more than selling to John)."
