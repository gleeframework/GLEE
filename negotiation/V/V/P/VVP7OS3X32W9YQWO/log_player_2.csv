"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's price of $12,000, but it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,250 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.
* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so he should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and see if he can reach a more agreeable price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price but lower than John's price of $12,000. 
* Bob wants to save money, but also needs to acquire the product. 
* Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product at a price that is within his budget and saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John.
*  It's likely that Alice will not go lower, so continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate and force Bob to buy from John, which would be a worse outcome."
