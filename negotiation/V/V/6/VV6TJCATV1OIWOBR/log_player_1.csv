**Reasoning:** 

Bob has not budged from his $1,080,000 offer in two rounds. This suggests he might be firm on this price. Accepting now secures a profit of $80,000, which is a good outcome. Continuing to negotiate has the potential for a higher price, but also risks Bob walking away, leaving you to accept John's lower offer."
