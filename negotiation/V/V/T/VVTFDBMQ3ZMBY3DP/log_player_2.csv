"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above the product's worth to her ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still a profit for Alice.  It's a good compromise, and accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
