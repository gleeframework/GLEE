"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start by offering his maximum price. This establishes his boundary and puts pressure on Alice to negotiate.  Since John is offering the product for $800,000, this is the best possible price Bob can hope for."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob. While it's a slight improvement, it's still above his budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a lower price. He can also consider the fact that he has a guaranteed alternative with John, making him less pressured to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible. He's increased his offer slightly from $800,000 to $850,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's still trying to get the best possible price.  He's also keeping in mind that John is his backup option, providing him with leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and with only five rounds left, the risk of not getting a better deal is increasing.  Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at a price that fits his budget.  It's time to secure the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
