{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product.  I think you'll find it's well worth the price of $14,500."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he wouldn't pay more than that.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $15,000 from the sale. 
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale of $15,000 to John if Bob declines.

**Strategy:**

We need to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough for him to accept, while still maximizing your profit.  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale with John encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially get a ""deal.""

**Why this offer?**

* **$14,500:** This price gives you a profit of $1,500 over Bob's valuation and is just slightly below your guaranteed price from John. 
* **""Great Deal"" Messaging:** By framing it as a ""great deal,"" you aim to make Bob feel like he's getting a bargain, even though the price is still very favorable to you. 
 
**Important:** There's always a chance Bob might decline. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
