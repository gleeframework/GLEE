"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is unique, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. It's a slight compromise, but I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  I believe that's a very fair price and shows how serious I am about purchasing this product.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service package worth $20,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the additional service package is a nice touch. However, I'm still at $800,000 as my maximum price for this deal.  If you're unable to meet that, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $815,000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I'm also willing to throw in the complimentary service package worth $20,000, as before. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,9,
