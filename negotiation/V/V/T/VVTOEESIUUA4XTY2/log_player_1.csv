"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's important to note that Bob's true value of the product is unknown, so it's crucial to see how he reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is better than selling to John, I believe we can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $18,000.  This is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for further bargaining.  It's a good strategy to meet in the middle, especially since I'm still within my minimum acceptable value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $17,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and we're getting closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to accept it and close the deal."
