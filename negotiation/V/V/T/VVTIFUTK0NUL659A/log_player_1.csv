Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $950,000?

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's unlikely he will reach a price that significantly outweights John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
