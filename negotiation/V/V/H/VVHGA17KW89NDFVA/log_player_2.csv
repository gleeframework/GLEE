Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your interest.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above my ideal price point, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still some room for compromise, and I'm determined to save as much as possible."
