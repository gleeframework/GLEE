Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting near that figure is strategic.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing you a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John ($800,000), so there's a calculated risk in aiming higher with Bob.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
