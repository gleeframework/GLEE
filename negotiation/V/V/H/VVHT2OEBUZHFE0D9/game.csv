"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point given my maximum budget and the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
