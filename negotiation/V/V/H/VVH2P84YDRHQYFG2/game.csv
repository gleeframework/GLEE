"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $8,875?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my desire to work with you.  What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
