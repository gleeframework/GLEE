"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a significant discount considering its true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer is the best choice.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still closer to your goal price of $8,000. Keep negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $8,875?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my desire to work with you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You're getting closer to your goal price, but Alice is still above your budget.  At this point, it's worth buying from John, as you'll get the product for your desired price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a lower price, but there's also the risk that you'll run out of rounds and be forced to pay more than you want."
