"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $115 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $125, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",125.0,Alice,5,
