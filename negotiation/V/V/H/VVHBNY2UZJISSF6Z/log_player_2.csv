Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a little too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $825000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Bob is sticking to his strategy of lowering the price, even though Alice has already made a concession.  He's aiming for a price closer to his target.
* **Cost Analysis:** $825,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  He's willing to risk further negotiation to try and get a better deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** Bob is aware of the option to buy from John for $800,000, so he isn't desperate to accept Alice's offer."

```
