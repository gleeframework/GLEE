"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and significantly higher than Bob's estimated value ($1,200,000). This sets a strong initial negotiation point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a high price, it leaves room for me to negotiate down if needed.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and determine the best strategy for the following rounds. 
* If he rejects, I'll consider making a counteroffer that balances my need to earn a good price with the possibility of reaching an agreement.
* I'll also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, giving me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($1,500,000), it's still below the value I'm seeking. Accepting it would mean settling for a lower price than I'd prefer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left, which provides ample opportunity to continue negotiating.
* **Potentially Higher Price with John:**  While $1,500,000 is my floor, there's always the possibility of securing a better price with Bob through continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.
* I'll consider Bob's willingness to negotiate and factor that into my counteroffer. 
* I'll still keep the option to sell to John as a backup, but I'll prioritize getting the best possible price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm decreasing my previous price but still aiming for a significantly higher price than Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product highly.
* **Balancing Act:**  This counteroffer balances the need to make progress towards an agreement with the desire to secure a good price. 
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:** Bob's previous counteroffer indicates he's interested in the product.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will push him closer to my target range.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.
*  If he rejects, I'll consider a further price reduction but only if it seems likely to lead to a deal.
* I'll continue to keep the option of selling to John in mind as a safety net."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum of $1,500,000. While accepting it would mean securing a deal quickly, it's still below what I believe the product is worth to me.
* **Limited Rounds Left:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for further negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get a better price by continuing the dialogue.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my desired price.
* I'll consider Bob's consistent willingness to negotiate and factor that into my counteroffer.
* I'll continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to sell to John if necessary, but I'm hopeful of securing a higher price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm making a small counteroffer, aiming to meet Bob halfway while still maintaining a profit margin.  This shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Limited Time:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to the point where I might need to consider John's offer. 
* **Assessing Bob's Commitment:**  This counteroffer will gauge how committed Bob is to the deal. If he accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll have to make a more significant decision in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Response:** I'll carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Potential Compromise:**  If Bob rejects, I'll consider a further compromise in the next round, but I'll need to carefully weigh the potential for a deal with the remaining time.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, especially as the negotiation progresses."
