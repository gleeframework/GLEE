"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7,500 is just too low for me. How about $8,500? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $8,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer of $8,000 is the same as what John is offering.  While I would prefer a higher price, I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid any further negotiation."
