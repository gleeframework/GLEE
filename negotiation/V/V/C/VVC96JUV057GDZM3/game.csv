"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",12000.0,Bob,4,
