"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your interests. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a little steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? I think that's a fair offer.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $725,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $800,000? That's my final offer. I think it's a fair price considering the potential returns you'll see.",800000.0,Alice,5,
