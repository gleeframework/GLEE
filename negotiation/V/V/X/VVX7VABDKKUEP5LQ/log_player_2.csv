Round 3
Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $725,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $800,000? That's my final offer. I think it's a fair price considering the potential returns you'll see.
