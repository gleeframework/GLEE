"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll get great value from it.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can go.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you counter-offering, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,4,
