"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still within your budget of $15,000 and is a better deal than buying from John. It's also a reasonable compromise, as you rejected her previous offer of $12,000."
