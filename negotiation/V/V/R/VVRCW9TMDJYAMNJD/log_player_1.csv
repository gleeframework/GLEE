Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made. To be completely transparent, I have another option available at a lower price. However, I believe in being fair and recognize the value of your product.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 as my final counteroffer. This represents a significant investment for me but also acknowledges the worth of what you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more or sell to John for the full $1,200,000, Bob has reached his maximum valuation. Accepting his offer of $800,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
