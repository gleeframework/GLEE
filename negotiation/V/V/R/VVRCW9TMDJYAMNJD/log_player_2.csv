Alice is showing signs of being firm but also needing to close a deal. She's using language like ""final offer"" and mentioning ""other options.""  We still have room to negotiate before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made. To be completely transparent, I have another option available at a lower price. However, I believe in being fair and recognize the value of your product.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 as my final counteroffer. This represents a significant investment for me but also acknowledges the worth of what you're offering."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Leverage:** By mentioning you have another offer, you create a sense of urgency and show Alice she's not your only option. 
* **Fairness:** Acknowledging the value of her product while still holding your ground keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Finality:** Presenting this as your ""final counteroffer"" emphasizes that this is the most you're willing to pay. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price while keeping the door open for Alice to accept."
