While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum in a timeframe that makes further negotiation worthwhile. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a significant amount more than Bob is currently offering. It makes the most financial sense to move forward with John."
