Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. It's a unique item, and I'm confident it will meet your needs."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By initially offering the product at $15,000, I create room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and uniqueness might make Bob more amenable to the higher price, even if it's above his initial valuation. 
* **Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation and having a backup plan in place."
