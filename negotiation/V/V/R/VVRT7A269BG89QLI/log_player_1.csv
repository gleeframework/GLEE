"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way more than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $140 is still more than I can do.  Would you consider $100?  That's a pretty significant increase from my last offer.

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but I can't go as low as $100.  Perhaps we could settle on $125? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting very close! I can do $120, but that's really the absolute most I can spend. It's a great product, and I'd love to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go above his stated maximum of $120.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price of $150, maximizing your profit and avoiding further negotiation rounds."
