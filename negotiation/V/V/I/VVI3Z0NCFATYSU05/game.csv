"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,300,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I understand your perspective on the value. However, I believe the product's true value is closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This price reflects the significant benefits the product offers and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you, while also being mindful of my own budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
