Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,300,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can still negotiate a better deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you, while also being mindful of my own budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,050,000 is a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
