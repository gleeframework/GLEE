Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price but leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find this offer attractive, as it's still below the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is above my minimum price, I'm not satisfied with it. I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $110. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair, given the value of the product to both of us."
