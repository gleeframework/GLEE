However, to make this deal attractive for both of us, I propose a special offer of $140. This price not only reflects the product's true worth but also allows you to enjoy a significant savings compared to the market rate. I trust this proposal will meet your expectations and help us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to your positive response!
