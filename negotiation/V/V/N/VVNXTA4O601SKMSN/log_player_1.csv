"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:** My message is friendly and highlights the benefit for both of us. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that the price is lower than what the product is worth to me, implying a willingness to compromise. 

**Next steps:**

*  I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll need to assess if I should counter-offer or go with John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. I am willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and acknowledges the product's value. This indicates that there's room for further bargaining.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain control and signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.

**Next steps:**

* I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, perhaps $1,600,000, and reiterate the benefits of the product.  
* If Bob continues to be stubborn, I'll need to weigh the risk of losing the deal versus potentially getting a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer, it's still a bit low.  Considering the true value of this product, I'm prepared to come down to $1,600,000.  This price is still fair to both of us, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer. This shows good faith and signals my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reiterating the product's true value to justify the price. This helps Bob understand the value proposition.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to continue negotiating. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great!  If he rejects, I'll need to evaluate whether to further compromise or explore the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is running out:**  We're only on round 4, and I need to consider the remaining rounds.  
* **Potential for better offer:** While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll have to settle for John's $1,500,000 offer.

**Next steps:**

* I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it's a good deal considering the time remaining and the possibility of a better deal not materializing."
