Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming high initially makes sense. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Time Sensitivity:** The ""one-time offer"" phrasing adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision.

By setting the price at $925,000, Alice has a good chance of securing a significant profit above her minimum acceptable price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
