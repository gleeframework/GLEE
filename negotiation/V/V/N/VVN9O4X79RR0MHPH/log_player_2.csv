"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $12,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, you can still do better. You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000. This indicates there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to push for a lower price or explore other options."
