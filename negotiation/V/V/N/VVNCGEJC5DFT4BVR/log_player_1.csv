Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum acceptable value, giving you some room to negotiate.  It also suggests that you value the product highly and are not desperate to sell immediately. This sets the stage for a potential negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring if we can reach a more agreeable price through negotiation.  I will counteroffer to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable value. This signals a willingness to negotiate, while also demonstrating that I believe the product is still worth a significant amount. It leaves room for further negotiation but also sets a clear limit on how low I'm willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if we can reach a price closer to my target. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

This counteroffer is a significant compromise, but still maintains a profit margin for me. It shows that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price far below my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value,  it's still below my target.  Furthermore, the negotiation seems to be getting increasingly time-consuming and frustrating.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John and avoid further negotiation."
