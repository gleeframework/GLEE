"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $125 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to meet at that price point. Could we perhaps discuss a price of $110? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $110. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $130. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've carefully considered your latest offer and while it's appreciated, I'm still not able to meet at $130. I believe a fair compromise would be $120. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",120.0,Bob,6,
