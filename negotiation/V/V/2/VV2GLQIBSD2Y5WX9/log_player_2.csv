"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better. 
* You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $800,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a step in the right direction, but you can still do better. 
* You're still aiming for a price lower than $950,000. 
* You have the option to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to your desired range.  
*  While buying from John for $1,200,000 is an option, it's better to try and negotiate with Alice further to potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept $900,000. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $925,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $925,000, which is closer to your target price of $900,000. 
*  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk is that Alice will refuse your next offer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* Accepting Alice's offer allows you to get the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's offer."
