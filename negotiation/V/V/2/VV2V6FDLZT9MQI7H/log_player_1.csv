{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob but still above my minimum value. This should encourage him to consider the offer while giving me some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm not willing to sell for $12,500 yet, so I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $13,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
