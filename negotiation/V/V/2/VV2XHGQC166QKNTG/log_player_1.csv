Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering it at $100 allows for a $20 profit for you, which is a significant margin.
* **Avoiding Extremes:**  While you could aim higher, going too close to $120 might make Bob hesitate. This offer strikes a balance between profit and the likelihood of acceptance."
