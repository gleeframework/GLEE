Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Target:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without explicitly revealing Bob's valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  It's unclear how open Bob is to negotiation or how quickly he needs the product. A very high offer might deter him entirely. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Having John as a guaranteed buyer provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell the product at its base value."
