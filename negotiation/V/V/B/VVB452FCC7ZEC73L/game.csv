"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $180 is a bit steep for me. How about $140?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $155.  That seems like a fair compromise.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $158? I think that's the best we can do without going below my minimum price.",158.0,Alice,5,
