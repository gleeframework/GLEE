"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product. Considering its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's worth without being aggressive.
* **Open to Discussion:**  By stating it's a ""starting point,"" you signal a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's considerably lower than both your minimum and his own stated value for the product. Rejecting this offer signals that you know the product's worth and are willing to negotiate strategically. You're still in a strong position, especially with John's guaranteed offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's true value and potential warrant a price closer to my initial proposal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal while acknowledging the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Not Too Much:**  You are making a concession from your initial price, but not a drastic one. This shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** You are reiterating the product's value to justify the relatively high price.
* **Open for Further Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for Bob to make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price. This is often seen as a fair outcome in negotiations.
* **Time Value:** While you could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could drag on. Accepting now secures a good deal. 
* **John's Offer:** While John offers the same amount, securing a deal with Bob now avoids any potential complications or delays that could arise from switching buyers."
