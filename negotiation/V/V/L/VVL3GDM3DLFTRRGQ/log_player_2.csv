Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the product's value. To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,200,000 from another interested buyer.  To make this work for us, I'd need a final offer of $1,175,000.  This is my best and final offer.

Alice is unlikely to go below her 'final offer' and it's still more expensive than John's offer.  Cut your losses and buy from John."
