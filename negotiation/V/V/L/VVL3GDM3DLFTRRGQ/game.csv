"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said, $1,350,000 is still a bit too steep for me. To make this work, I could go up to $950,000.  That's a significant investment on my part and reflects the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. Considering the value this product brings, I could come down to $1,250,000. This offer reflects the significant worth of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the product's value. To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,200,000 from another interested buyer.  To make this work for us, I'd need a final offer of $1,175,000.  This is my best and final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
