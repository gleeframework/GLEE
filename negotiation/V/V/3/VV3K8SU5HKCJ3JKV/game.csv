"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to come down a bit more and sell it to you for $10,800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",10800.0,Alice,5,
