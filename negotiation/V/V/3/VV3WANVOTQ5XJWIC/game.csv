"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $14,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my part. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
