"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and quality, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $14,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my part. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price point in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
