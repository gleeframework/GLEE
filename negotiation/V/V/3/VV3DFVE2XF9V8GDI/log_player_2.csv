Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a bold move, but it forces Alice to either come down significantly or risk losing the deal.  It's important to leave room for negotiation, but also to be assertive in demonstrating that you're serious about getting a good price."
