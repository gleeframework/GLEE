Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, the price is now within his budget and getting closer to his desired price. There's a risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers, and he could end up paying more or not getting the product at all.  Accepting this offer ensures he gets the product for a price that's reasonable."
