``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is selling for $1,300,000, while John is selling for $1,500,000. This means buying from Alice saves Bob $200,000.
* **The product is within Bob's budget:**  Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is below that."
