"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While $120 is more than Alice's value of $100, it's still less than the $150 you'd pay John.
* **You save money.** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $30 compared to buying from John."
