"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $10,000 for it.  Would you be open to considering that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,000?  It's a fair price that's closer to my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you closer to your budget. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
