Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your decision soon, as there are other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While I know I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, aiming higher initially maximizes potential profit.  
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though we haven't specified what the product *is*.
* **Urgency and Competition:** By mentioning ""other interested parties,""  I create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** We don't know how risk-averse Bob is. If he's highly risk-averse, a lower initial offer might be more successful. 
* **Negotiation:** This first offer assumes there's room for negotiation. Bob could counter-offer, giving me a chance to lower the price and still exceed John's offer."
