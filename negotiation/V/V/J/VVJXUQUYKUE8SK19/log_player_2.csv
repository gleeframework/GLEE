# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a unique opportunity for you, as you know it's worth significantly more to you.  Let me know if you're interested, but I'm confident another buyer will be happy to take it off my hands at $1,000,000 if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You can get the product for $1,100,000 from Alice, which is $100,000 less than buying from John. 
* **Even though Alice says she has other buyers, it's likely she's trying to pressure you.**  You know the product is worth more to you, so it's in your best interest to accept her offer."
