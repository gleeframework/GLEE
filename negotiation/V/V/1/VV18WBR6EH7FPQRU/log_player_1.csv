Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, not just focusing on the price. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $1,250,000, there's enough space for Bob to make a counteroffer without me immediately going to John. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and consider whether it's worth further negotiation. 
* **If John is a better option:**  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  While it's closer to my desired price than his initial perceived value, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. 
* **I have the option of selling to John for a much higher price.**  This gives me leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open.**  By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer that hopefully brings us closer to a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.** I'll aim for a price closer to my target of $1,500,000, but still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. 
* **If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll evaluate whether it's worth further negotiation or if selling to John is the better choice.**"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great price for the value this product offers. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product, reminding him of its worth.
* **Making a Compromise:**  I'm presenting the $1,300,000 counteroffer as a compromise on my part.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Open:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, but it still gives me room to potentially sell to John if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating or if selling to John is the best option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budgetary limitations, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am still not able to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the highest amount I can realistically allocate towards this purchase. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's getting closer to my target, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000.
* **I'm comfortable selling to John for a much higher price.**  This provides me with a strong alternative to accepting Bob's offer.
* **Rejecting keeps the negotiation open.** This allows me to make a final counteroffer that hopefully persuades Bob to reach my desired price or at least get closer.

**Next Steps:**

* **I'll make one final counteroffer to Bob.**  I'll aim for a price closer to my target, but acknowledge Bob's limitations.
* **If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll move forward with selling to John.** I'm confident that selling to John is the best decision for maximizing my profit."
