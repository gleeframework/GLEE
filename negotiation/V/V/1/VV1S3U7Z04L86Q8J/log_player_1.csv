Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145.  I think it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed price gives you room to potentially negotiate down a bit if Bob tries to haggle but still stay above your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $145 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($120), but it might be tempting enough for him to consider, especially if the product offers him unique value that he hasn't factored into his valuation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible approach.  Gauging Bob's interest level and potential willingness to negotiate would be helpful in a real-world scenario."
