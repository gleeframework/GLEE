"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```reason: Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's room for negotiation. ```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While it looks great, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"", ""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Beginning negotiations significantly lower than your target price ($100) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a better deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses interest in the product while clearly stating the offered price is too high. This encourages Alice to continue the conversation. 
* **Strategic Goal:** By starting low, we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and move towards a price closer to our target without immediately revealing our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

```reason: While Alice's offer of $110 is closer to your budget, it's still slightly above what John is offering. There's still room for negotiation to try and get a better price from Alice. ```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. That said, $110 is still a little more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer proposes a price directly between Alice's last offer ($110) and our previous offer ($70). This common negotiation tactic suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise.
* **Targeting Below Target:**  While our goal is to spend no more than $100, aiming slightly below keeps the negotiation moving in our favor and allows for potential concessions.
* **Maintaining Interest:** The message remains positive and continues to express interest in finding a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 was still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $90, which would be $100. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.
