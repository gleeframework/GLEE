"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of this product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price, hoping Alice will see it's close to her own valuation and be willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial counteroffer, showing willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still below my maximum budget, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to meet in the middle."
