"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of this product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
