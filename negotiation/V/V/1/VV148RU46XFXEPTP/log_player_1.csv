"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his perceived value and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is still too low for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer, but I'll need to gauge how serious Bob is about the product.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid wasting more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I'm concerned that further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
