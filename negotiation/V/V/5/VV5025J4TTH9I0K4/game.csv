"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000 at most.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This would still be a significant profit for you, and a fair price considering the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer. How about $950,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000? This would give you a good deal while ensuring I get a fair price for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go above $975,000. I think that's the maximum I can afford for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
