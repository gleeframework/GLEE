"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value to you.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $920,000 still doesn't quite work for me. Would you be willing to go up to $940,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
