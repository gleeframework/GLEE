"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, as it's the maximum I can afford.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $11,750. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you place on the product as well.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,750 is still a little higher than I can comfortably go. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $11,250 for the product.  This would allow us both to walk away with a fair deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept $11,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value I place on the product. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",11500.0,Alice,7,
