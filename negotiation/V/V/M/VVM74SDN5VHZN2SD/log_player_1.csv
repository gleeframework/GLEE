Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but slightly below John's offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency (Implied):**  By not mentioning John directly, the high price subtly implies the product is in demand, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:** While this is a strong opening strategy, Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer."
