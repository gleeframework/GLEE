"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will really benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $7,500?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $6,800? I'm ready to close the deal if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to a number that works for you. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $7,200. This is my best and final offer for now.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget for this purchase. I can do $6,900, and I'm willing to finalize the deal immediately at that price. Let me know if that works for you â€“ otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",6900.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $7,500. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",7500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still beyond what I've budgeted. I can offer $7,000 as my absolute final offer. This purchase is time-sensitive for me, so I need a decision today. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately have to go with John.",7000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand the urgency and appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $7,500. I'm willing to give you a small concession, so I'll meet you at $7,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",7200.0,Alice,9,
