We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can nudge Bob a little closer to our desired price point."

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're still above John's offer:**  $1,775,000 is a significant amount above John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is moving in smaller increments now. It's unlikely we'll get much higher than his current offer without risking him walking away entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A deal in hand is worth more than the potential for a slightly better deal later. Closing the deal now allows us to use the funds sooner."
