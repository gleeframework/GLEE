"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's below my minimum:**  I'm willing to sell for at least $120, so I have room to lower the price if necessary. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to consider it.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

I'll counter with a price closer to $100, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us. This can help Bob feel more inclined to accept.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  While I'm willing to come down, there's still room to adjust the price slightly if necessary. 

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than $92, hoping to find a middle ground.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  If Bob rejects again, I'll be ready to consider selling to John in the next round if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $93.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 93}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer, putting some pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Slightly higher than Bob's offer:** I'm still offering more than Bob's last offer of $92, but it's getting closer to my minimum.
* **Firm, but not overly aggressive:**  I'm not going too low, but I'm also not being unreasonable.

At this point, I'm nearing my minimum price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but $93 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $88 is significantly below my minimum price of $120.  I've already made several concessions and am nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's clear that we're too far apart in our valuations. 

At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $120, which guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation."
