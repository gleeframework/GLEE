"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $12,000? That way, we both get a fair price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
