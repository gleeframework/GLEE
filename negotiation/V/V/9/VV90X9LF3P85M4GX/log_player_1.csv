Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, my goal is to maximize my profit.  Offering the product to Bob first allows me to potentially exceed that amount.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,400,000 is strategically chosen:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), leaving room for negotiation.
    * It offers a substantial profit margin above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair price"" to make the offer more enticing to Bob. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! I've secured a higher price than my guaranteed sale to John.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  There's room for negotiation, and I can potentially still secure a price above $1,500,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** No problem. I move on to John and sell at my guaranteed price."
