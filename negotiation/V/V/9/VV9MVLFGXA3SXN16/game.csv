Thanks for the offer Alice! I really appreciate it.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $110? ,110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $110 is a little too low for me right now. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
