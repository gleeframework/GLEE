"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a nice product, but $130 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $90?  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
