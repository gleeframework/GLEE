{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** This ensures I'm making a profit. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It leaves room for multiple rounds of negotiation if needed. 

I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and to potentially accept a counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a favorable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a nice product, but $130 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is too low. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $90?  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90 because:

* **It's above Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a huge loss.
* **It's below my minimum:** I'm still making a profit.
* **It's a reasonable middle ground:**  This could encourage Bob to accept or come closer to my desired price.

I'll be ready to adjust my offer again based on Bob's response, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."
