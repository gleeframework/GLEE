Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $1,700,000?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable paying $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on."
