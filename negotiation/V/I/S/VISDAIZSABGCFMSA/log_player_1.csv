Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product you might be interested in for $120. It's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good idea to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While I know Bob values the product at $100, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the product as valuable.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so there's no risk of losing money."
