Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but not exorbitantly high. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm showing flexibility while still trying to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While $125 is still lower than my initial goal, it's a significant improvement from selling to John.  The risk of further negotiations is that Bob might become less interested, and I'd end up with a lower price or even losing the sale. This offer ensures a decent profit and avoids those risks."
