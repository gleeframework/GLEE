"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  How about $140? That's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit far from my budget at $140. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?,130.0,Bob,6,
