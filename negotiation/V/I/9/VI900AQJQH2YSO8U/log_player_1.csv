Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start significantly higher to explore Bob's potential upper limit. 
* **50% Markup:** The offered price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from Bob's perceived value. This provides substantial room for negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher profit. 
* **Confident Language:** The message uses positive and confident language to frame the offer favorably and potentially influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. How we proceed depends on Bob's response to this initial offer. We may need to negotiate down, but always aiming to secure the highest possible price above our minimum of $1,500,000."
