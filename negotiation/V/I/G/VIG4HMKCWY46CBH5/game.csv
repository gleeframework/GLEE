"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. How about $10,000? That's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
