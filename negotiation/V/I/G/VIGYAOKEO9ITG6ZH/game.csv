"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from where I'd need to be. How about $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,200,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident it's worth that to you as well.  Let's try $1,225,000 as a compromise.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I have a firm budget in mind. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,187,500? This feels like a fair solution to me.",1187500.0,Bob,6,
