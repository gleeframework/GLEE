"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, as you know the product is worth even more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is way too low for me, even though I'm aware of his value for the product. I need to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from where I'd need to be. How about $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price and I'm not comfortable selling for that amount. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,200,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident it's worth that to you as well.  Let's try $1,225,000 as a compromise.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I have a firm budget in mind. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,187,500? This feels like a fair solution to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,187,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Even though Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is above my minimum threshold."
