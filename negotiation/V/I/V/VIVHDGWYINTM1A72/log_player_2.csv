"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $120 is too high for Bob, who values the product at $150. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob time to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to get the price down as much as possible, so he starts with a significant counteroffer. 
* $100 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and open to negotiation, keeping the conversation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, as you mentioned the product is worth $150 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $110 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than the $100 he initially offered.  
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating. 
* With 7 rounds remaining, there's still time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still stuck at $105. Let's split the difference and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer but staying firm on getting a good price. 
* $105 is a reasonable compromise, as it's halfway between his last offer and Alice's. 
* The message is still friendly, maintaining a positive tone during negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $108? It's a fair compromise that's still very beneficial for you given the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $108 is a good deal for Bob. It's only $3 more than his last offer, and he's already met Alice halfway in the negotiation. 
* Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product without having to pay John's higher price.
* There are still 5 rounds remaining, but continuing to negotiate might not yield a significant price difference."
