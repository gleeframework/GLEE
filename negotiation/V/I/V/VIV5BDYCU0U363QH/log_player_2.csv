"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm asking for $1,350,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to need to counter with $1,200,000. I've done my research and believe this price is fair, considering the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't let it go for that price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  While Bob might be able to squeeze out a little more in negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and potentially losing the deal entirely is high.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision, as it secures the product at a price that is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's."
