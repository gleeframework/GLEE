"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. How about we split the difference at $105 and call it a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to negotiate, she's unlikely to go much lower than $105.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed option at $100 from John."
