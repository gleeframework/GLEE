"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
