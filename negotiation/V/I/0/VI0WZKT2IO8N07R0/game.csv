"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,200. This is a fair price that still gives me a good profit margin.",13200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $13,200 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $12,200?",12200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,200 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $12,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",12800.0,Alice,5,
