Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable.  I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** I know Bob values the product at $150, giving me room to negotiate above my minimum price ($100).
* **Starting high but reasonable:** Offering it at $130 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. It's unlikely Bob will immediately accept, but it sets a strong starting point.
* **Alternative buyer as leverage (implied):** While I don't explicitly mention John, knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $100 gives me confidence in my pricing strategy."
