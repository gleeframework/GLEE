{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $100 but below your minimum acceptable value of $120. This leaves room for negotiation, potentially reaching a price that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, as it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. I'm willing to go up to $108, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $108 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can close the gap further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and $108 is a good offer. However, I'm only willing to go down to $112. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to reach a fair price for my product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112}
