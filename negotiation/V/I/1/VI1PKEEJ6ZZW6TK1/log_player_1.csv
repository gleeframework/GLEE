Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $90, you leave some room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. This gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit before resorting to selling to John for $80."
