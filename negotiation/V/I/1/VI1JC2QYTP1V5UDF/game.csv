"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's a unique product with a lot of value, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I think that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $980000. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $970000, but I think that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",970000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not convinced that $970000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980000 and $970000, which is $975000. That's my final offer. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
