"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! I've determined its fair market value to be around $900,000.  I'm willing to start with a price of $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the product's unique value and gives you a good price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're not quite aligned on the price yet.  While I value your interest, $775,000 is still too far below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to go a bit lower, to $800,000,  but this is my final offer.  It's a fair price that recognizes the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.",800000.0,Alice,5,
