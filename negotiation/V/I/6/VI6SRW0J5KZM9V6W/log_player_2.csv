Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $900,000. This still leaves plenty of room for you to profit, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.
