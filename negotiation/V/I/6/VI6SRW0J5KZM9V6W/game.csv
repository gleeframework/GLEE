"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $900,000. This still leaves plenty of room for you to profit, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $875,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
