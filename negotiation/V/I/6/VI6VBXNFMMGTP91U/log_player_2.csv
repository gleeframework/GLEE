"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer ($9,500) since it's worth $8,000 to Alice. It's worth $10,000 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's value ($8,000). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer if she wishes."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a lower price by making another counteroffer.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and hopefully get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price that's within my budget and closer to what you're looking for. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again offering a price that is closer to the middle ground between his initial counteroffer and Alice's last offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate without immediately going to his maximum. The counteroffer is still reasonable for both parties and could potentially lead to a quick deal."
