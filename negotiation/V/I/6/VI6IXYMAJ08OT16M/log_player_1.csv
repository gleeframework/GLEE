Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  $900,000 is still significantly below what I value the product at, and I have several rounds to try and get a better deal."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $925,000 is still just not enough for me. How about $940,000?  That's a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal, I know you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 940000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're really close, but I still need to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not going any higher than that. Can we finalize the deal at this price?

We're down to the wire and Bob's offer of $925,000 is still too far below my desired price. I'm not willing to risk another round and possibly end up with a worse deal. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000."
