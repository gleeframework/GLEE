Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic [product name] that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm interested in selling, $120 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm open to negotiation, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $160?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $140 is still above my minimum of $150 and it seems like Bob is firm on that price.  It's better to close the deal than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
