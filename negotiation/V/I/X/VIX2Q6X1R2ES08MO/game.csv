"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm open to negotiation, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $160?  Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
