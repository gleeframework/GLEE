"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but leaving some room for negotiation. This shows I'm confident in the product's worth while also acknowledging that a deal is possible.  I'm hoping to get a good starting point and see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but I still believe the product is worth more than $950,000.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This is a firm but reasonable offer that acknowledges Bob's desire for a lower price while still reflecting the product's significant value.  With only 5 rounds left, I'm aiming to reach a final agreement that's fair for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to keep pushing for a higher price. There are only 4 rounds left, so I need to be strategic. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer but still above Bob's latest counteroffer. I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway and close the deal in the next few rounds. With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to be realistic but firm in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to John's, I'm still hoping to get a better price. There are only two rounds left, so I need to be strategic. I'm going to make one final counteroffer to Bob.  I'm hoping that he'll come up a bit more in order to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. With only one round left, I need to be realistic but firm in my negotiations.  I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finally close the deal."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only one round left, I'm running out of time. While Bob's offer is slightly higher than John's, it's still not enough to reach my desired price. It's a risk, but I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's important to secure the sale, and John's offer is the most secure option at this point."
