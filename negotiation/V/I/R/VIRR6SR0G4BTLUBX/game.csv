"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1000000 to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm a savvy buyer, and I've done my research. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1000000. What do you think, Alice?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're a savvy buyer, and I appreciate your research. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I'm getting a bit tired of negotiating, but I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1000000. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1030000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1030000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, and I'm still not willing to pay $1030000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go up to $1015000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1015000.0,Bob,6,
