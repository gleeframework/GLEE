"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a fair starting point, it doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to finalize this deal.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I think this price is a fair compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
