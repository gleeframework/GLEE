"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its worth to you. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $875,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I still believe we can find a more suitable price. Could we perhaps aim for $825,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
