"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, a price of $1,050,000 wouldn't allow for a sufficient return on my investment.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product at $1,100,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while respecting your budgetary concerns. I'm confident that this offer will be mutually beneficial.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
