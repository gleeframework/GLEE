"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of your product, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than our initial ask, but we're willing to meet you halfway. We're willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a competitive price that still reflects the product's value, and we believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
