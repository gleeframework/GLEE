"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is the lowest I can go. If you're interested, this is my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
