"Hello Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $135 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about $75? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $115 for the product. Let's try to find a sweet spot between $110 and $120, how about $118?",118.0,Alice,5,
