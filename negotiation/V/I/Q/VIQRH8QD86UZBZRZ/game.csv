"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a bit more value for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",107.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $106.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",106.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. How about we try $108? It's a small step closer to my initial offer, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,
