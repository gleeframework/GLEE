Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item with significant potential, and I believe it's well worth the investment. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and potential justifies the high asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message aims to open a dialogue. If Bob counters, there's space to negotiate down towards his valuation while still staying above the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. If Bob is put off by the high initial price and refuses to negotiate, Alice loses the opportunity for a higher profit. However, with the guaranteed sale to John, Alice is not at risk of losing the $1,000,000 value."
