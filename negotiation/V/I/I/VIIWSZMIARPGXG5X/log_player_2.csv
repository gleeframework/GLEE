{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's definitely worth trying to negotiate with her before resorting to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  I'm offering half of her initial price, which is a significant discount. If she rejects this, I'll gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm significantly increasing my offer this time, showing Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway. This offer is close to my maximum budget, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the potential for further negotiation.  If Alice rejects this, I'll be forced to consider buying from John, but I'm hoping we can reach a deal before that."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm determined to try and secure a better price. With only a few rounds left, I'm going to make a strong counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final push. I'm going to offer Alice a price that is very close to my maximum budget, but still leaves some room for potential negotiation. I believe this offer is fair and reflects the value I place on the product. 

If Alice rejects this, I will have no choice but to buy from John, but I'm hoping that she recognizes the value in closing a deal with me."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we are down to the final round.  I've made several counteroffers and showed a willingness to negotiate, but she hasn't budged enough.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer to avoid overspending. I'm happy to secure the product for a reasonable price, even if it's not the absolute lowest."
