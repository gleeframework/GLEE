Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000.

``` 

Bob should accept the offer. Alice has lowered her price from $6,500 to $6,000, which is closer to Bob's target of $5,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject the counteroffer and he'll have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures a good deal and avoids potential delays."
