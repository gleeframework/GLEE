"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $7,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $7,250 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",7250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $7,100 is my final offer.",7100.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any higher than $7,200. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me at $7,200, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other offers.",7200.0,Alice,7,
