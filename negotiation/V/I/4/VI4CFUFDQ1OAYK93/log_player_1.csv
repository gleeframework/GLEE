Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $13,500 is cutting it pretty close to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference and call it $14,250?"", ""product_price"": 14250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.

It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my desired price point. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
