"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $13,500 is cutting it pretty close to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference and call it $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,5,
