"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.  Would you be willing to consider $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand your position, but I need to see a price that better reflects the value this product brings.  How about we land at $1,550,000? I'm confident that at this price, you'll see a significant return on your investment.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
