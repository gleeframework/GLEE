"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me.  I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000. This represents a significant potential upside for you.  Let me know if you're interested in exploring this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. While she claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, that doesn't necessarily reflect its true market value.  

You have a guaranteed alternative with John, who is willing to sell you the product for $800,000.  This is the most sensible option, as it saves you $1,200,000 compared to Alice's offer."
