"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum. Let's start our negotiation journey! ",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000.  That's still a significant profit for you, and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This shows my willingness to meet you halfway, while still securing a good deal for myself.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000.  Let's try $890,000. It's a smaller jump, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution. I'm confident that this price will be beneficial for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
