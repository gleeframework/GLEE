"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer. How about $11,000? Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Can we consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $10,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would be a great price for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $10,250? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10250.0,Bob,6,
