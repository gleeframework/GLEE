{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $500,000 is a great price, but there's room for negotiation. 
* I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further. 
* I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to take a few rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 30% discount from Alice's initial price.
* This demonstrates my serious interest in buying the product while also setting a clear expectation for a lower price.
*  I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $450,000 is still a good deal, I'm not ready to accept just yet. 
* Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can still get a lower price.
* I'm prepared to continue negotiating and see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $400,000, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* This middle ground approach can potentially encourage Alice to accept the offer or propose a counteroffer closer to mine in the next round.
* I'm confident that I can still get a good deal without risking losing the opportunity to Alice by offering too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $425,000 is getting closer to my target price.
* I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's likely that further counteroffers might result in a stalemate.
* While I could potentially get a slightly lower price, I'm confident that $425,000 is a good deal and I'm willing to accept it.
* There's also the risk of losing the deal completely if I continue to reject offers. 
* It's important to consider that I have 10 rounds, and I want to ensure I secure the product within the given timeframe."
