"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer is $9,500, which is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* Bob can get the product from John for $8,000, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible, but also wants to keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for compromise. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can always choose to buy from John for $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* Bob can get the product from John for $8,000, which is the best price available to him.
* It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice since there's no guarantee she'll come down further.
* Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his target price and avoids further negotiation."
