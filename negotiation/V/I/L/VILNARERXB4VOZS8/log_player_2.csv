"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the outcome. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, it's still higher than John's offer. 
* You can get the product for $100,000 less by going with John. 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most beneficial strategy."
