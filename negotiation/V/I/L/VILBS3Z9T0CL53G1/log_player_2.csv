Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go down to $7,600 just yet. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount to $8,000, which is the price I was originally willing to sell it to John for. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're getting a good deal:** $8,000 is a $2,000 savings compared to John's offer and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Alice is signaling firmness:** By mentioning her original price and calling it her ""final offer,"" Alice is indicating she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Further negotiation risks losing the deal:**  You've made good progress, but there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk Alice walking away or you running out of rounds."
