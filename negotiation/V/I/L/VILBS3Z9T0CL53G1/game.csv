"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, your initial price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest though, $8,200 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle somewhere in the middle?  Would you be willing to go down to $7,600?",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go down to $7,600 just yet. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount to $8,000, which is the price I was originally willing to sell it to John for. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,5,
