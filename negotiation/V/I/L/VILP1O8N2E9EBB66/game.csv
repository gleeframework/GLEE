"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and allows us both to have a successful transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $750,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident you'll see its benefits. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, though. How about $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not ready to give up on the value I believe the product holds. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident you'll see its benefits. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference. How about $812,500? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement that allows us to finalize this deal.",812500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to give up on the value I believe the product holds. I'll meet you halfway again. I'll offer the product to you for $815,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident you'll see its benefits.
