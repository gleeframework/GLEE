Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150 starting price:** This is a good starting point, higher than my minimum but not too high to scare Bob away. 
* **Friendly message:** I aim to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  I mention the product's value to make Bob think about its worth to him. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing my potential profit and keeping Bob interested in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $120.  This still allows me to make a profit while staying within a fair range for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not going all the way down to Bob's offer.
* **Reasoning:** I explain the counteroffer with a reason, emphasizing a ""fair range"" for both of us.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I keep the message friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation going. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $110 as my offer for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's likely that we won't be able to agree on a higher price. Accepting his offer will allow me to sell the product and make a profit, and it's a better outcome than selling to John for $100."
