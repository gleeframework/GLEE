"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. Would you be interested in buying it from me for $15000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000 and John is already willing to sell the product for that price, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  Bob can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
