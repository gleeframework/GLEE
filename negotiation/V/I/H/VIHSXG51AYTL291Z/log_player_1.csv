"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product, but your initial price is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting a lower offer now risks leaving a substantial amount of money on the table."
