"Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product, but your initial price is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but the product's value is considerably higher than that to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
