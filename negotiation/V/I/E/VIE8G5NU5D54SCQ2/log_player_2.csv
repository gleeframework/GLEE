"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. While I can't disclose all the details at this point, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000, giving you a significant advantage. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. This means you'll save $100,000 compared to buying from John. Even though you don't know all the details about the product, it's still a good deal."
