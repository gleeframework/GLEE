Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth in the market.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer sets a strong anchor point. This might make Bob perceive anything below $1,300,000 as a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for potential counteroffers from Bob. This allows for a negotiation process that could still land within a range profitable for Alice.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly influencing Bob's perception without being overly aggressive. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance, different approaches could be more effective."
