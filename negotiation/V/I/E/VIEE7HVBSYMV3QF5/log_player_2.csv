# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is way above your budget.  You should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum price point of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute minimum price. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation.  You've already made a significant attempt to negotiate with Alice, and it's unlikely she'll come down further."
