Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer.

I'm accepting Alice's offer. While I would like to pay even less, this offer is still a good deal for me as it's below my maximum budget of $15,000 and a better deal than buying from John."
