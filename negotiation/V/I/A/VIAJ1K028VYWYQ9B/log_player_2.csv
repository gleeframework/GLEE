"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, but I believe it would be of great value to you as well. I'm offering it to you for $900000. It's a price that reflects the product's worth, but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Consider this a chance to acquire a product you value at $800000 for a slight premium. Let me know your thoughts.
