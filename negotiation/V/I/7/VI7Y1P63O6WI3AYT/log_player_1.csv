Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so don't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit by capturing as much of that surplus as possible.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to start high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.  Here's an option:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense:**

* **Strong Opening:**  It anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Room to Negotiate:** You leave some space for Bob to counter-offer, making him feel more in control of the process.
* **Profitable:** Even if Bob negotiates you down slightly, you're still well above your minimum sale price to John.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price based on Bob's response.  Good luck!"
