Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") suggesting a willingness to discuss the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to accept a price that might be appealing to him."
