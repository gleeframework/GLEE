Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 130}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a decent offer. Since I'm not eager to sell at a loss, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new offer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial price. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

{""product_price"": 115}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be prepared to negotiate further or sell to John if the price is right!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer of $130, and I rejected his offer of $105, I'll make a new offer that's in between those two prices. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 115}

I'm hoping Bob will find this offer more appealing and be willing to meet me in the middle."
