"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm getting closer to my minimum but I still believe I can get a higher price. I'm not willing to settle yet.  I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob and I'm not ready to sell to John for a lower price than my minimum."
