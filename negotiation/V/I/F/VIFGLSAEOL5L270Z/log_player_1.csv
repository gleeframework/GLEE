Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $120, you are setting an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he doesn't accept this price, it might make a lower counteroffer seem more reasonable to him.
* **Knowing Your Worth:** You know John will buy the product for $80, so you have a guaranteed minimum. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, since you have a backup buyer, you are not at risk of losing out completely."
