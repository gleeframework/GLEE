Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable value. However, I'm running out of time and I'm not sure if I'll be able to secure a better deal in the remaining rounds. To avoid risking losing the deal entirely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
