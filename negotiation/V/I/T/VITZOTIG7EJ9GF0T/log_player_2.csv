"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can do better than $11,500.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I can still negotiate further, $11,000 is a good price and closer to my desired price point. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
