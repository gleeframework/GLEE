Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a reasonable range, considering Bob's value.
* **Positive and Friendly:** The message is upbeat and inviting, hoping to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm aware that Bob's value is lower, so I'm leaving room for a counteroffer and negotiation. 
* **Ready to Walk Away:** I'm also aware that John is a potential buyer, which provides me with leverage."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150).  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize the value:** I highlight the ""great deal"" for Bob, hoping to motivate him.
* **Positive and persuasive:** The message is enthusiastic and aims to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. This is the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to significantly undervalue my product.  John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is more than Bob's final offer. It's time to move on and sell to John."
