It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal than $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, and it shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal."

Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get the price down further by making another counteroffer."

I'm going to try to meet Alice halfway by offering $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it shows that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, and it's likely that we're nearing a point where further negotiation would be unproductive. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product, rather than risking further rejection and potentially ending up buying from John at a higher price."
