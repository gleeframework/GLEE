I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a good profit."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's a good compromise and a significant profit compared to selling to John.  It's also getting close to the end of our rounds, so I'm not taking any more risks."
