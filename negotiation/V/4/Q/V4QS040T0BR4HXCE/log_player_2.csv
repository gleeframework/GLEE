"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's also quite a bit higher than the product's value to her ($1,200,000). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. Considering the value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This would allow us both to benefit from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,280,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value to you is $1,200,000, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm proposing $1,260,000.  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1260000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,290,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's true value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering it to you for $1,285,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,285,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,290,000. Considering the value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,275,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above your preferred price, it's getting close to your target and is a significant improvement from the previous rounds.  There are only a few rounds left, and if you reject this offer, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a calculated risk, but accepting this offer seems like the best option to save money while still getting the product."
