"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. Considering the value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This would allow us both to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,280,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,280,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value to you is $1,200,000, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm proposing $1,260,000.  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal.",1260000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,290,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's true value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering it to you for $1,285,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1285000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,285,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm offering $1,270,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1270000.0,Bob,6,
