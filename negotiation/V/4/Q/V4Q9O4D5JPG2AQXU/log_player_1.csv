Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you get significantly more than your minimum if Bob accepts. 

**Why this strategy:**

This approach aims to strike a balance between:

* **Greed:**  Demanding the full $150 might make Bob balk, even though it's a good deal for him.
* **Losing Out:** Offering too low (close to $100) means you leave potential profit on the table. 

By starting at $140, you give Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a slight discount while you still secure a very favorable price."
