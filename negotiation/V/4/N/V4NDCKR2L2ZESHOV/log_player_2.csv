# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant discount from your maximum budget, it's still higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. Your goal is to save money, and buying from John directly achieves that. 

**Important Note:**  Alice's message is full of sales tactics.  Don't be swayed by phrases like ""immense value"" or ""exceptional investment."" Focus on the actual numbers and your bottom line."
