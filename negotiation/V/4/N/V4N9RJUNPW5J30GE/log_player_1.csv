Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  I'm starting at $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $9,500 is a good deal.  I'm getting closer to my goal, and it's likely Bob won't come up much higher."
