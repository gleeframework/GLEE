Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant benefit to you considering its potential value of $1,200,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards if Bob counters.
* **Secure the Sale:** The offer is still significantly more attractive than John's $1,000,000 offer, making it likely Bob will accept."
