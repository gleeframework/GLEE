{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've stated that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, so this offer gives you a $200,000 profit.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  The price is still below the value Bob places on the product, making it a potentially good deal for him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You've left some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. 

Remember, this is just the first step. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and the ongoing negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than your initial asking price, it's still below your minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  Accepting his offer would mean losing money.  

Rejecting his offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price.  You can still potentially make a profit by selling to Bob, and you have the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and a good deal for you since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting your minimum:** This offer meets your minimum threshold of $1,000,000, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **Reasoning with Bob:** The message emphasizes the value Bob places on the product, making it more appealing.
* **Showing flexibility:** You've shown flexibility by lowering your initial price, which could encourage Bob to compromise.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and move the negotiation closer to a deal. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response, but this is a good starting point to secure a good price."
