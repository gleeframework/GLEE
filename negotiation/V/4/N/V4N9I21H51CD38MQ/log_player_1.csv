Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I open the offer to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 gives Bob a significant discount compared to its value to me ($1,500,000) and is still a substantial profit over John's offer. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to make a decision quickly without revealing I have a guaranteed buyer.

This approach balances maximizing potential profit from Bob with the security of John's offer."
