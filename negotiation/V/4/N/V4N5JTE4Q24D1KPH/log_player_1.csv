"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I'm not giving away too much.
* **Focusing on value:** My message highlights the value the product holds for Bob, emphasizing that it's a good deal for him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end the message by welcoming Bob's thoughts, making it clear I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John.
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:** I believe I can push for a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Strategic negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer shows I'm serious about my value and encourages Bob to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price is fair considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm making a counteroffer, but I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in easily.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price that is in the middle of my minimum and Bob's offer, creating a sense of compromise.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product, justifying the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** We're nearing the middle ground, but I can still try to push for a higher price. 
* **John as a safety net:** Having the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me a strong negotiating position. I can risk rejecting this offer, knowing I have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to reach my target and giving you a product that's worth more than what you're paying. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Almost there:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's not quite there yet. I'm still confident I can push for a better price.
* **John as a safety net:** Having the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'm not in a desperate situation to accept this price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $980,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,020,000.

We're almost there, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:**  I'm increasing the price slightly from my previous offer, but staying within a reasonable range. This shows I'm willing to meet halfway but I'm not giving in too much.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  I'm reiterating that this price is a good deal for both of us, highlighting the value and the win-win scenario.
* **Urgency and closure:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""We're almost there, let's close this deal."" This might encourage Bob to accept, as it suggests the negotiation is nearing its end."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in round 8, leaving only two rounds left before I have to decide. 
* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While there's still potential to negotiate further with Bob, I'm not confident that I'll be able to reach my desired price within the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed alternative:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a significantly higher profit than what I'm likely to get from Bob. 

Given the limited time and the potential for a better outcome with John, it's strategically wiser to sell to John and secure the guaranteed higher price."
