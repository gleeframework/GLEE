Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $890,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 890000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) leaves space for potential negotiation downwards.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price and potentially persuade Bob even if it's slightly above his initial valuation.
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John at your desired minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by testing Bob's willingness to pay while securing your minimum acceptable price with John."
