Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I can offer it to you for $102.50. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $102.50 is closer to your desired price, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $100.  At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and you're better off securing the product at the best possible price from John."
