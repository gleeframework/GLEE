"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to make at least $125 for this to work.  How about we split the difference and go with $127.50? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to make the sale.",127.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $127.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $127.50. How about we go with $118.75? That would be a great deal for me and I'd be happy to make the purchase.",118.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $118.75 is still below what I need to make on this sale.  How about we meet halfway between your last offer and my minimum of $120, at $119.37? It's just a small step closer to your budget and would allow us to make this deal work.",119.37,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $119.37 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. How about we go with $117.50? It's the best I can do, but I really want to make this purchase work.",117.5,Bob,6,
