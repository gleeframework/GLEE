"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your holdings.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to purchase now.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. While I value your business, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I'm seeking. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still reflects the value of the product. This is a fair price that I believe offers you a good deal while also ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a compromise.  This offer reflects the value of the product to me while giving you a reasonable return. Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
