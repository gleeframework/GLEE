"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your top end is $800,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
