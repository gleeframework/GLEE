``` 

This offer is slightly below my minimum of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept. 

I'm keeping the door open to sell to John for $10,000 if Bob doesn't accept my offer. This gives me a safety net and allows me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I'll try to meet him halfway and see if we can come to an agreement.  If not, I can still sell to John for $10,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  What do you think?

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I'll try to meet him halfway again and see if we can reach a deal.  If not, I can still sell to John for $10,000."
