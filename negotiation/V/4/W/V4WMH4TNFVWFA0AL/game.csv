"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price allows you to acquire the product within your budget range while I receive a fair return.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? This is the highest I can go, and I really think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,350,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while you still secure the product for a competitive price.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still looking for a profit, Alice, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider my final offer.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
