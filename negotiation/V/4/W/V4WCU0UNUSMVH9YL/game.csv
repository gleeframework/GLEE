"Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential of the product, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
