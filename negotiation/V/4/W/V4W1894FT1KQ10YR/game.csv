"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $15,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to pay $13,500. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
