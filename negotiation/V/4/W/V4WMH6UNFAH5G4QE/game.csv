"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. How about we try $12,800? It's still a good price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise.",12800.0,Bob,4,
