Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling below your value of $12,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** It leaves room for negotiation, but is still a good deal for him considering its worth to him.
* **It allows for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price.

Keep in mind that this is just the first offer. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below your initial offer. It's worth pushing for a higher price, especially since you have the option of selling to John for $12,000 as a safety net.  By rejecting the offer, you can counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to reach a compromise closer to your desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. How about we try $12,800? It's still a good price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is only slightly above what you could get from John, it's important to consider the following:

* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or even a lower final price. 
* **Time is money:**  Closing the deal quickly allows you to move on to other opportunities.
* **Slight profit margin:**  $12,800 is still a decent profit compared to selling to John, especially considering the product's worth to Bob.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale with a reasonable profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
