"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most financial sense to go with John's offer."
