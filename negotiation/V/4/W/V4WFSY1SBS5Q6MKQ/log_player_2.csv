"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would still give you a significant savings and leave me with a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.
