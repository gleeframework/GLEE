"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would still give you a significant savings and leave me with a fair price.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000, but I need to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $882,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.",882500.0,Bob,4,
