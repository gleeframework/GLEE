"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above his ideal of $1,000,000. He should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price from Alice or from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  $1,050,000 is still a good price for Bob, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise. It's a bit higher than Bob's ideal price from John, but it's still within his budget and saves him some time and effort compared to continuing to negotiate.  There's a chance that Bob could continue negotiating and get an even better price, but it's not a guarantee.  This offer represents a reasonable balance between getting a good deal and minimizing risk."
