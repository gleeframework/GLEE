{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This offer allows for some room for negotiation but still gives me a profit. I'm willing to go down a bit if needed, but I won't sell for less than $1,200,000, as that's my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't go below my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell for. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for some room for compromise. Let me know if you're open to this figure."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and it's getting close to the point where I might be better off selling to John.  I'm willing to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
