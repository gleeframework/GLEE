"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this reflects a fair compromise given its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,050,000 is significantly below what I consider fair given the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves a substantial margin for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm unable to meet you at $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this reflects a reasonable compromise considering its value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still quite a bit below what I consider fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's aim for a quick resolution.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to agree to $1,087,500. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,070,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product to me.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
