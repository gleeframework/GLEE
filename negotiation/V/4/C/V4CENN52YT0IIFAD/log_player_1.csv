Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he negotiates you down a bit.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below Your Minimum:** $130 is more than what Bob values the product at, but less than your guaranteed sale to John. This creates a potential win-win situation.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message aims to be friendly and entice Bob by highlighting a ""special price"" and potential value.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a $30 profit, which is better than the $0 profit if you went directly to John.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly and still make a profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
