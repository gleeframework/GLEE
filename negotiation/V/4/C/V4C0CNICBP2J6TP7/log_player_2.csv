"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $90 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the opportunity, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to offer you $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $80, but he doesn't want to go too low in the first counteroffer. Offering $85 gives Alice some room to negotiate while still offering a good discount for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $87.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $87.50, which is significantly closer to Bob's target price of $80. While he could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or him running out of rounds is increasing. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without risking losing it."
