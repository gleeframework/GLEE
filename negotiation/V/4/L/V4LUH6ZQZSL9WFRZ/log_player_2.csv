"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $10,000, while John is selling for $12,000.
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice:** Bob values the product at $12,000, while Alice values it at $8,000. This means there's room for negotiation, and Alice's offer is still a good deal for Bob. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John."
