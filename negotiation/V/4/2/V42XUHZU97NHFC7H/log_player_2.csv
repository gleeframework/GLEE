"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have an amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You're aiming to save as much money as possible and have 9 more rounds to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you consider $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to your ideal price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You have 7 rounds left, so there's still room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice.  $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $105?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not sure I can go any lower. How about we meet at $115? I think that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, and with only 5 rounds remaining, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers. $115 is a good price for the product, considering your $150 budget. It's a good deal and saves you $35 compared to buying from John."
