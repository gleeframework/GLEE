"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I think it's a fair deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a good deal compared to the product's true value, it's not within your financial constraints. You can get the product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the better choice."
