"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I could be flexible to make this work. How about we settle at $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $1,950,000?",1950000.0,Bob,4,
