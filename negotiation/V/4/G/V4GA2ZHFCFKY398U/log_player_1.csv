Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a higher offer ($1,000,000) allows you to potentially get a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A high initial offer implies the possibility of coming down in price, which can be a good negotiation tactic.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes your belief in the product's value while also positioning the offer as a special opportunity for Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. You can always adjust your price downwards during the negotiation, but you can't go higher than your initial offer."
