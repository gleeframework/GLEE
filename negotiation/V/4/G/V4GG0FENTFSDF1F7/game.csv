"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $9500? I believe this would still be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is still at least $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
