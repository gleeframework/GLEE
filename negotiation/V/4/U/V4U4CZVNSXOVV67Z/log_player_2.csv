"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth $1000000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $800,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $800,000.  I'm willing to pay $700,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it reflects the market value as well.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's value to you and the market value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good price for Bob.  He's already saved $250,000 from the original offer, and going another round might not yield a significantly lower price.  It's a good compromise, and accepting the offer ensures he gets the product while saving a substantial amount."
