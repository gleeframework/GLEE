Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $800000.  I'm willing to pay $700000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it reflects the market value as well.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
