"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth $1000000 to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $800000.  I'm willing to pay $700000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it reflects the market value as well.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's value to you and the market value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Alice,3,
