"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $120 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $115? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a great idea. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $107. How about we meet in the middle at $112? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price!",112.0,Alice,5,
