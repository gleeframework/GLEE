{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) and higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel more inclined to negotiate.

**Next Steps:** 

* I'll wait to see Bob's response. 
* If he rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it. 
* I'll be mindful of John's offer of $100 and will be willing to stop the negotiation and sell to John if I feel I won't be able to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $110 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** There's still room for negotiation. While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** John's offer of $100 provides a fallback option if I can't reach a satisfactory price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll need to balance being firm with remaining open to negotiation to potentially close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a good price for you and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm moving my price down from $110 to $90, showing a willingness to negotiate but not caving in to Bob's initial low offer. 
* **Balance between Firmness and Flexibility:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's a compromise that might be appealing to Bob.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll wait to see Bob's response to my counteroffer. 
* If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and whether to accept or reject it.
* I'll keep John's offer of $100 in mind as a safety net if I can't reach a satisfactory price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** Bob's offer is closer to his initial offer of $65 than to my last counteroffer of $90.  It indicates he might not be willing to budge much more.
* **John's Offer is More Lucrative:**  John's offer of $100 is still a safer option than accepting Bob's current offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make one more counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100). I'll need to be firm but also willing to compromise slightly to see if we can reach a deal. If Bob rejects again, I'll sell to John."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Last Chance:**  I'm making it clear that this is my last offer, indicating I'm serious about getting the negotiation settled.
