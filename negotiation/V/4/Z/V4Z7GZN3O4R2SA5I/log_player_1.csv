Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for some potential haggling if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  It's crucial that our offer to Bob is significantly higher than John's $100 offer. This ensures we prioritize the more profitable sale. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
