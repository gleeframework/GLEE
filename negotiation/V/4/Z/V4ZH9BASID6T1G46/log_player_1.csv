"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I need to make. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,200. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,200 is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round or potentially sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $8,200 is still too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. It's a good opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $8,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is the price I was initially willing to pay for the product from John. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I was hoping to get a slightly higher price from Bob, the negotiations have been dragging on, and John is offering a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement. It's not ideal to have to walk away from Bob, but ultimately it's the best decision for me financially."
