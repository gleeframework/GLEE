"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $170. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $120 from John, so there's no reason to pay $170."
