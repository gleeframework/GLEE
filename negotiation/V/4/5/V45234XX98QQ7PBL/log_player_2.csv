"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to immediately accept the offer. By rejecting, Bob can see if Alice is willing to negotiate and potentially lower the price.  There's still a lot of room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. Offering $10,000 immediately establishes that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if Alice isn't willing to compromise.  This initial offer gives Bob a strong starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still room for further negotiation.  Bob is willing to pay a little more than his initial offer, but $11,500 is still above his ideal price. Rejecting again keeps the negotiation moving and allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by making a counteroffer closer to Alice's latest offer.  Offering $11,000 shows that Bob is willing to meet halfway, while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential deal without giving up too much ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is now within a reasonable range for Bob.  He's already saved $800 from his initial budget and is only $200 away from his most recent counteroffer.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, avoiding further negotiation and the risk of Alice walking away.  While he could try for a lower price, there's a higher chance that Alice might reject it, leading to further negotiations and potentially a worse outcome or even losing the deal.  At this point, it's strategically better to secure a good deal than risk losing it for a few hundred dollars."
