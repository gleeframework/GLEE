"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $15000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference at $16500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal of $16500, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $17000. I'm getting a bit anxious to sell the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $17000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. Let's meet in the middle at $16750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",16750.0,Bob,6,
