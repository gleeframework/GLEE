"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I recognize the product's value, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit higher than your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to sell it for, considering its value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $650,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.",650000.0,Alice,5,
