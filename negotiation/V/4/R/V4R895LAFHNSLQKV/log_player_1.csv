Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down in price later.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and potential, Alice is providing a rationale for the high price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, Alice keeps the conversation open and invites a counter-offer.

**Strategy:**

Alice's strategy is to aim high with Bob while knowing she has a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000. This gives her leverage in the negotiation:

* **Ideal Scenario:** Bob accepts the $1,500,000 price, maximizing Alice's profit.
* **Negotiation:**  If Bob counters, Alice can gradually reduce the price, aiming to stay above $1,200,000.
* **Backup Plan:** If negotiations fail, Alice can always sell to John at her minimum acceptable price."
