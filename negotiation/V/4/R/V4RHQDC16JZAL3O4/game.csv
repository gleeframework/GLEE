"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find valuable. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the feedback, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,250 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
