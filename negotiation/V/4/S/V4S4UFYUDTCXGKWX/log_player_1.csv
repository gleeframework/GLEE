{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is more than fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum selling price. This allows you to start high, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a price that's highly profitable for you.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""potential value"" and Bob's ""expertise,"" you subtly appeal to his perception of the product's worth, making the high price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob to share his thoughts, suggesting a willingness to negotiate. This is crucial because a flat ""take it or leave it"" approach might scare Bob away.

**The goal:** This offer aims to strike a balance: maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept, avoiding the need to sell to your backup buyer, John."
