"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about 155?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 140. How about we meet at 147? I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",147.0,Alice,5,
