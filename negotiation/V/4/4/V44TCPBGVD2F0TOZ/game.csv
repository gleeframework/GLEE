"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8500?  This is still a great price for you, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to agree on a price. While I'm open to negotiation, $7000 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $8000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a good deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
