"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. My initial offer is $900,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I respect that. However, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering your potential gains. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000, which would be $775,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your position, $775,000 still undervalues the product's potential for you. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's make this deal happen. ",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $800,000, which would be $787,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",787500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close. I'm going to make one final concession and offer $812,500.  This reflects the value of the product for you and represents a significant compromise from my initial position. Let's make this deal happen now.",812500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,8,
