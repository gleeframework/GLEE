"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the potential of this product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential this product holds. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price is a testament to my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a significant distance from my budget. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a substantial increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the continued discussion. I recognize you're making an effort to find common ground. To be transparent, reaching my minimum acceptable price requires a significant step from your current offer.  I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. This keeps us moving forward, but reflects the product's true worth.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product,  $1,700,000 is still beyond my reach. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to raise my offer to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine commitment to acquiring this product.  Let's keep working towards a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I can see we're making progress.  To find a solution we both can agree on, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept for this product.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
