"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $150. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both your budget ($100) and what John is offering ($100).  It makes the most sense to go directly to John."
