Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think we can do better than that. Would you be willing to consider $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Bob's offer:
