"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $115, but I'm still a bit over budget. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'll offer you a compromise: $112.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",112.5,Alice,5,
