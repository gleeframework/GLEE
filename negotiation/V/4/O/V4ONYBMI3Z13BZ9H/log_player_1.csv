Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, giving me a potential profit. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so there's a risk he might reject the offer. However, if he does, I can still sell it to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
