"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value it brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit away from that price point. How about $12,000? That's a fair offer, considering it's your value for the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $12,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $13,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings to you.",13200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. While $13,200 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $12,500.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and reflects my strong interest in the product.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll offer you the product for $13,400. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings to you.",13400.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're so close on this. I understand you're firm on your price, but I can't quite meet it. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,950? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",12950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,950. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll offer you the product for $13,300. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings to you.",13300.0,Alice,9,
