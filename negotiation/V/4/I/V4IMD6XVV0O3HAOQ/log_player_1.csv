Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer aims to maximize your profit while still leaving room for negotiation. Here's the reasoning:

* **$1,000,000 is your minimum:** You're guaranteed this amount from John, so it's your baseline.
* **$1,500,000 is a significant markup:** It's a 50% increase over your minimum, making it a potentially attractive deal for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Bob may counteroffer, giving you the chance to negotiate a price closer to your ideal value. 

Ultimately, the best price depends on your understanding of the market and Bob's potential need for your product. However, this offer is a starting point that balances risk and potential reward."
