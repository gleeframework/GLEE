Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit margin for you (well above your $1,200,000 minimum). 
* **Create Urgency:**  By stating it's an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you subtly imply that if Bob doesn't take the deal, you have other options (John).

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a deal and avoid resorting to selling to John at your minimum acceptable price."
