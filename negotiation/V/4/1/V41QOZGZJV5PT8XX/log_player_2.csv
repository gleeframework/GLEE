# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice is trying to convince you that the product is worth more to you than it actually is. While her offer is below her own valuation, you have a better option with John who will sell it to you for your maximum price."
