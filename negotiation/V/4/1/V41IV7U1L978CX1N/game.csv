"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however, the product is worth significantly more to me than that. Could you consider $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $107.5? This feels like a fair compromise.",107.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $107.5 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
