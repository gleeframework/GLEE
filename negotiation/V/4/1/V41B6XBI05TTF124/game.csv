"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, your price is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a significant amount and reflects my serious interest. I'm confident this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial asking price reflects the true potential and scarcity of this product.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive opportunity for you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still out of my reach.  To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This represents a considerable investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
