{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. He should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so he's trying to get a significant discount.  He's offering $10,000, which is still within his budget but leaves room for negotiation. This aggressive stance might force Alice to compromise quicker."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice has moved closer to his initial offer, he's still willing to negotiate further.  He's likely hoping that Alice is eager to close the deal and will be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of slowly closing in on a price that's closer to his ideal but still allows for further negotiation. He's raising his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  He's hoping that Alice, eager to close the deal, will be more willing to accept a price closer to his offer this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now close to Bob's ideal price point.  While he could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer and ultimately buying the product from John for $15,000 is high. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $1,800 compared to buying from John, making it a good strategic decision."
