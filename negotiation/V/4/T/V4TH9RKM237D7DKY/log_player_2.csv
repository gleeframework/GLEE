It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get a better price than $750,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $700,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for her to make a profit."

$725,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my ideal price. It's not worth risking a further negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up paying more from John."
