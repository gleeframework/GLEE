Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still open to negotiating. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make sure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer.

Alice seems firm on her price, and while I could try to negotiate further,  $11,250 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It avoids the risk of losing the deal and having to pay more through John."
