"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial value of $1,000,000, you can potentially get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  We're aiming for a price close to your maximum budget of $800,000. Offering $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and shows you're serious about buying.
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves some room for Alice to counter if she's willing to compromise.  

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Alice's offer of $875,000 is very close to your maximum budget of $800,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, and you'll be forced to buy from John at $800,000.  
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, it's wise to take this offer and secure the product."
