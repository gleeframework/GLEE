It's always worth exploring options before committing to a price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,000,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still staying within my budget."

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my goal, it's still above my ideal price.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While this is a tempting price, I'm not ready to commit yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1110000}

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $1,110,000.  This is a small increment, signaling that I'm close to my limit but still hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $1,120,000, which is just slightly above my last counteroffer and within my budget.  With only a few rounds left, it's a good time to accept and secure the product. There's a chance I could get a slightly lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will reject my next offer and I'll end up buying from John at a higher price."
