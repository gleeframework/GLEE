Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000 to Bob, so hopefully he'll be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm willing to risk losing the sale to John in hopes of getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price, but I'm also trying to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can push him up to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is only slightly higher than John's offer. If Bob doesn't accept this, I'll move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating. It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer."
