"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal for something worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a profit. It also acknowledges the value Bob places on the product, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to Bob and what you initially offered.  It's worth pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is my final offer. Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum price, and it's a fair compromise given the negotiation so far.  There's no need to risk further haggling and potentially losing a deal."
