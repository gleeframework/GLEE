{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. There's a large gap between her offer and your budget, and there's a chance she'll come down in price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, close to my budget.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but won't overpay. Hopefully, this prompts her to start moving towards a compromise."

Alice has moved closer to my price, but it's still higher than what I want to pay.  I'll continue to try and negotiate a lower price."

I'm raising my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. This should hopefully put us closer to a deal, while still staying within my budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still a bit above my desired price, but we're getting closer. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Alice to make a deal. If she rejects it, I'll go with John's offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is not budging much, and we're getting close to the end of the rounds. It's better to secure the product at John's price, even though it's not the best possible deal, rather than risk losing out entirely."
