{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that is higher than my minimum but still appealing to Bob. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, as I know he values the product at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me, would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $115.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  It's still a great price for a product worth $120 to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good deal, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is very close to my minimum price of $100. I'm happy to accept this deal, as it's more profitable than selling to John."
