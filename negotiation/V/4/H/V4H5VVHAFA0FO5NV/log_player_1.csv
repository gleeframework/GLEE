"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to maximize my profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm starting with a 50% markup on my minimum acceptable price. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I have 10 rounds to work with.  I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price by $250,000 to show some flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further. This is still a significant profit for me, and I think it might be appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and his offer is now above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale for a good profit."
