Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit for Alice.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and engage in a discussion about the product's value.
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John.  This eliminates the risk of a lowball offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while still offering Bob the first chance to purchase the valuable product."
