Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the potential value to Bob, making him more likely to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates I'm open to discussing the price, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer.

This approach balances the desire to maximize profit with the need to keep the negotiation open and potentially secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's interest is encouraging, I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and maintain control over the negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this work.  This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that is lower than my initial price but still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my asking price. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and open to negotiation.

This approach aims to find a compromise that's more favorable than Bob's offer while still demonstrating flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price. There's a chance he could counteroffer again, pushing the price below my minimum.
* **Secure alternative:**  John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is a safer and more profitable option than risking a further decline in Bob's offer. 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the certainty and minimal loss associated with selling to John outweigh the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob."
