"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,162,500? That would allow us both to get a good deal.",1162500.0,Bob,4,
