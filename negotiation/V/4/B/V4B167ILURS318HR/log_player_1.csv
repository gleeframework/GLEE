Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 180
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $30 markup (from $150 to $180) is a significant increase but not outrageous. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **""Special Price"" Psychology:**  Framing the offer as a ""special price"" implies that Bob is getting a unique opportunity. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's value to Bob, he might not be as aware or willing to pay a premium. There's always a risk he'll reject the offer.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer. Having a minimum acceptable price in mind (perhaps $165-$170) will help you in a potential back-and-forth."
