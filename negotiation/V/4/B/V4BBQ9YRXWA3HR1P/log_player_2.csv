"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. $12,000 is above your limit, so rejecting the offer makes sense in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a lower price than I'm willing to pay to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still above my limit, but she's getting closer.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and might lead to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying below my limit.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm willing to walk away if we don't reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and it's only $250 more than what I'm willing to pay from John. It's unlikely that I'll get a better price in the remaining rounds, so accepting this offer makes sense."
