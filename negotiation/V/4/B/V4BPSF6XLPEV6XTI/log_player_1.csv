Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, but he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives its value to be even higher. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $10,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. This way, I can still potentially secure a price higher than my minimum. 
* **Polite and Open Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob's perspective. This can encourage a positive response and open the door for negotiation."
