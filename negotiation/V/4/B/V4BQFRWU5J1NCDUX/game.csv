"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,400,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a profitable deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to strike a deal, I need to be realistic about the product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This is my final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
