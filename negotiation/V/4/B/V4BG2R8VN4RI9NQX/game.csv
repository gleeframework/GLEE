"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000.  It's a unique piece and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is just too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $16,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Would you consider $13,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still too low for me.  How about $15,500? This is a fair price that's closer to both of our desired values. Let's see if we can agree on this.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting closer. I can appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $14,500 and we have a deal?",14500.0,Bob,6,
