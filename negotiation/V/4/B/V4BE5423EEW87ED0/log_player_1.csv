Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a great deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John provides a safety net at $1,200,000, Alice can confidently price higher with Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for Alice."
