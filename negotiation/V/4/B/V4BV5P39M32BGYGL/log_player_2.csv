"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, Bob can still try to get a better deal. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget, and I believe it still allows you a good return on your investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit high. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. However, to show you I'm serious about making this deal, I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a good price for both of us, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, Bob has already made several counteroffers, and it seems Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that's acceptable for him. Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option to avoid further negotiations and get the product for a price that fits his budget."
