"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its true value for me, and still gives you a solid profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for Bob.  

Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value you placed on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it is still above his maximum limit of $1,200,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  He can always choose to buy from John for $1,200,000 if he can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a reasonable profit while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,300,000 is still slightly below my target. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,325,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's a step closer to his budget, the negotiations are not progressing quickly enough.  

Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative option with John, it makes sense for Bob to cut his losses and purchase the product from John for $1,200,000.  This ensures he gets the product at the best possible price for him and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
