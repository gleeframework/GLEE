Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his perceived value is higher than John's.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a significant margin for profit while still being significantly below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Respectful Negotiation:** The tone is respectful and acknowledges Bob's potential gain (""its potential value to someone like you""). 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
