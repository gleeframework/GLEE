{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000.  It's a steal at that price, considering its true value to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. It's better to continue negotiating and aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product brings to you. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,350,000? This would still be a significant win for you, and we can close the deal quickly.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price. It's a good deal for both of us, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
