Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would greatly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so aiming slightly below that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still landing you above your minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" can nudge Bob towards quicker acceptance.

**Important:** Offering $15,000 directly might seem too obvious to Bob that you know his maximum. This could lead to him lowballing a counter-offer."
