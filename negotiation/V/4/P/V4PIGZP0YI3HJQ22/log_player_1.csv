Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I do have other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation and increases the chances of securing a price higher than your minimum ($10,000).
* **Strong Opening Stance:** Presenting a confident initial offer can signal the product's value to Bob.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Risk Management:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have the security of selling to John at your minimum desired price."
