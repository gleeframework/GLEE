Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer,  $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a price significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'll be prepared to counter if Bob rejects, but I want to see what his initial response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $800,000, which is less than my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but lower to show I'm willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,500,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer and above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's an increase from his previous offer. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000, which is my minimum value. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm starting to feel like John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still above my minimum value and closer to my ideal price than Bob's latest offer. I'm trying to see if there's any wiggle room in Bob's position. If he rejects again, I'm going to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a difficult decision, but I think it's time to sell to John. Bob's offers are still below my minimum value, and while I could continue negotiating, it's clear he's not willing to meet my price.  John is a guaranteed $1,200,000, and at this point, that's a better option than the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
