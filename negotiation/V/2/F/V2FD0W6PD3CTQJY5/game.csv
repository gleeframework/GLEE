"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
