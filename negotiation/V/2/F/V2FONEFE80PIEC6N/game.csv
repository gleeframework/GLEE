"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to get a better return on investment. I'm willing to consider other options if this isn't feasible for you, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1000000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This price reflects the unique potential I believe this product holds for you.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1100000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value and my budget constraints. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I'm willing to work with you, $950000 unfortunately doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm prepared to drop my price further, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for the potential you'll gain from this. Let's meet in the middle at $1050000. This price would be a win-win, allowing you to secure this valuable asset while also ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my financial constraints. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
