"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 represents the high end of this product's value, I understand your budget constraints.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair offer considering the value this product will bring to your business.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,500,000, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to accept a bit less to seal the deal today.  How about $1,350,000? This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,350,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close today.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
