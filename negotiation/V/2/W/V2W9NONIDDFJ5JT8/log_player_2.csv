"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's something you're interested in and it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $1,100,000 given its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's price of $1,200,000, Bob can still do better.  He should reject Alice's offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price with her."
