Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's something you're interested in and it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $1,100,000 given its value.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down. Even if he counter-offers, it's likely to be higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** $1,100,000 ensures a significant profit margin while still seeming reasonable to Bob given his valuation. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but it's worth aiming high to maximize potential earnings."
