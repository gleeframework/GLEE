,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in buying it for $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be interested in buying the product for $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I think that's a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $105. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $115? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",115.0,Alice,7,
