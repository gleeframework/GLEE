"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth discussing. Let's aim for a fair price that reflects its true worth to you. Would you like to start with a price, or shall I propose an initial offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm aiming to buy the product for significantly less than $9,500. I'll counteroffer and see how much she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer ($7,000 vs. $9,500). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite and Positive:** I want to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice, so my message is courteous and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  My goal is to buy for under $8,000 (Alice's value).  By starting low, I'm aiming to shift the negotiation closer to my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in our product. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $8,200 for the product. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this offer works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice is coming down, but $8,200 is still above her perceived value of the product ($8,000). There's room for further negotiation.
* **Limited Rounds:** I have a limited number of rounds, so I'll continue to push for a lower price.  Getting closer to Alice's value increases the chances of a deal. 
* **John's Price as Leverage:** While I want a better deal than $8,200, John's offer of $10,000 provides a fallback.  Alice doesn't know this, but I have an alternative if the negotiation fails."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $8,200 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm raising my offer slightly from $7,000 to $7,500. This shows Alice I'm willing to move, but I'm not going to meet her halfway just yet. 
* **Staying Below Value:**  My offer is still below Alice's perceived value of $8,000.  The goal is to reach a price that's a win for both of us.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I continue to use positive language to foster a good negotiating environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your feedback and our ongoing dialogue, I propose a price of $7,800 for the product. It's a step closer to your preferred budget while still reflecting its value. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Quite:** Alice is getting closer to her perceived value, but $7,800 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I believe I can get it lower.
* **Time Remaining:** We're halfway through the rounds. I'll push a bit more aggressively, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** My next counteroffer will be crucial in determining if we can close a deal below $7,800."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're right, Alice, we're getting closer!  I'd be willing to agree to $7,600.  I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and works for my budget."",
""product_price"": 7600
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's directly in the middle of our last two offers ($7,500 and $7,800).  This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to compromise and reach a deal quickly.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:** My message emphasizes that this price is fair for both of us. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds left, a slightly more aggressive approach is warranted to try to close the deal."
