"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go below $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher. Bob is determined to save as much as possible and can likely negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I'm getting closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's meet in the middle at $862,500.  This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $880000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $880000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $880,000 is tempting, Bob is still within his 10 rounds.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. It's a gamble, but it could lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm still a little above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $870,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can agree on this price.  If we can't, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $885000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $885000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a stubborn streak. She's consistently meeting Bob halfway but not budging further.  While there's a possibility that with continued negotiation, Bob could get a lower price, the risk of not closing the deal is high. 

With only 3 rounds left, the potential savings are minimal, and Bob is already close to his desired price from John. Buying from John provides certainty and avoids the risk of losing out entirely to Alice."
