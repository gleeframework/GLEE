,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1250000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000 to meet you halfway.  This price still gives me a decent profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's try to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1300000, which is closer to my maximum and represents a significant step towards your desired price.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1300000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more, at $1325000. This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. Let's make it happen!",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal, but $1325000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1300000 one last time. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. ",1300000.0,Bob,6,
