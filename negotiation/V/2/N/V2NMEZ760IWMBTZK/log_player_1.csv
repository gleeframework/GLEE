{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit, and the offer is attractive enough that Bob might be interested.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It sets a strong starting point:** This makes it less likely Bob will make a ridiculously low counteroffer.

The key here is to be flexible but also confident in the value of your product. You'll have to see how Bob responds and adjust your strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than your minimum, it's still below your initial offer, which implies there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $120.  You can then gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a little room to compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise. You've moved closer to Bob's offer, but it's still above your minimum. This shows you're willing to negotiate, but you're also firm in the value of your product.  You're hoping Bob will either accept this offer or come up just a little bit."
