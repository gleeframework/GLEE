I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,450,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is attractive to Bob, given its value to him is $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than what I was initially hoping for, but it's still a good deal. However, I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
