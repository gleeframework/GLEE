"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $140? This way, we both get a fair price.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $140. I'm willing to meet you at $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $130 is still below my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle again at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're sticking to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $135. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",125.0,Bob,6,
