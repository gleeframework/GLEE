# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by you. Considering its quality and the value it brings, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. This allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($120 < $150).** 
* **You save money compared to buying from John ($150).** 

Even though the product is only worth $100 to Alice, it's still a better deal for you than buying from John."
