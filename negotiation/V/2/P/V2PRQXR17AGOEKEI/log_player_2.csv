# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be a valuable asset to you. Considering its quality and benefits, I would like to propose a price of $150 for this product. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget, and we can discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Since Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no incentive to negotiate further. You can get the same product from John for the same price, eliminating the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
