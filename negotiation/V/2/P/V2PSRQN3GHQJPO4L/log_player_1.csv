Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing Alice to still potentially get a higher price than her backup offer from John ($8,000).
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price exactly in the middle of their valuations ($8,000 and $12,000) makes Alice appear fair and might encourage Bob to accept without further negotiation."
