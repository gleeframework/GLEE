Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $80 for the product. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $90?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $85 is within my minimum acceptable range.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing him completely and having to settle for the lower offer from John."
