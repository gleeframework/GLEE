{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting closer to my target price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can convince Alice to accept a price closer to $1,050,000.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 is still a worse deal than accepting Alice's offer, but I have enough rounds left to keep trying."
