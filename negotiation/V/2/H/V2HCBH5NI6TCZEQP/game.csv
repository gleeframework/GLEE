"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. This is my maximum price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the potential value of the product for you, while still allowing me to earn a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1200000. However, this is still a bit higher than my maximum.  I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
