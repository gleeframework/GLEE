``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, hoping to get a better deal.  I know Bob values the product at $80, so this is a significant markup, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than what Bob initially offered, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to sell to John if he doesn't."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with John, so I'll sell to him."
