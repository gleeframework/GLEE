"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about $875,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $862,500? It's a fair compromise that I think we can both live with.",862500.0,Bob,4,
