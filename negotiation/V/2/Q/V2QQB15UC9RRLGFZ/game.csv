"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your product has value, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $115?  That's closer to my budget and leaves some room for us both to be happy.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm ready to close the deal at $120.  Let's make it happen!",120.0,Bob,6,
