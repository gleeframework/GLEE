Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $2,000 discount compared to your fallback offer, and you earn an extra $1,000 compared to selling directly to John.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and highlights the value proposition for Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still maintaining a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
