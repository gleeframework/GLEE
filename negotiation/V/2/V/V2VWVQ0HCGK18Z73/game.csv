"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is the price I've been told by John, the other seller. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. While I appreciate your offer, I believe the product's value is closer to my initial proposal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,350,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to sell, I do need to  stay above $1,400,000 for this. How about we split the difference again and land at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,375,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,325,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
