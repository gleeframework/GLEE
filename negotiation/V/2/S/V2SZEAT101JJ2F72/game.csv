"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm very interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $11,200. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",11200.0,Alice,5,
