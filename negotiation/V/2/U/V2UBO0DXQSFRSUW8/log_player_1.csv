Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value, but leaving space for counteroffers and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is a better price than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. I believe I can achieve a higher price through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, but still remaining above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly higher than selling to John. It's a good compromise that allows me to achieve a reasonable profit."
