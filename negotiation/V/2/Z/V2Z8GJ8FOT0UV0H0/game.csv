,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. Would that be something you'd be willing to consider?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for $160, but I'm still only able to offer $130. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $130, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $145. Would that work for you?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $145, but I'm still capped at $135.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",135.0,Bob,6,
