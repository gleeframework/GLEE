"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to the product's true value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his $800,000 limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still slightly higher than my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference -  I'm prepared to pay $862,500 for the product. This is a fair price that represents a significant savings for you and is within my financial limitations."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. After re-evaluating the market and considering your latest offer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $880,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000.  It's clear that further negotiation with Alice may not result in a price that Bob is willing to pay.  Given that John is offering the same product for $800,000, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
