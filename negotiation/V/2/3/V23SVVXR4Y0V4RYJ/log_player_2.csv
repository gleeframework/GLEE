{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price.  While John is a fallback option, Bob should explore getting a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $900,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also making a strong initial bid."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's target price, and it's still significantly lower than buying from John.  Accepting this offer is the most logical choice for Bob, maximizing his savings while still securing the product."
