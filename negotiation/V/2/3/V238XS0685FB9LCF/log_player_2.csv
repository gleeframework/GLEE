"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a very competitive price. Would you be interested in paying $90 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while buying the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $90, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $100.
* **Strategic reasoning:** Bob should reject the offer and counteroffer a lower price. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's strategy:**  Offer a price that's closer to Alice's value ($80) but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer justification:**  Bob expresses interest and provides a reason for his counteroffer, making it seem more reasonable. 
* **Remaining rounds:** Bob has 9 rounds left, so he can afford to be a little firm."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to make a bit more on this. How about we settle on $87? It's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while buying the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $87, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but getting closer.
* **Strategic reasoning:** Bob has 8 rounds remaining, so he can continue to push for a lower price. He knows that Alice is willing to sell for at least $80, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer but $87 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $86. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at that price."", ""product_price"": 86}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's strategy:**  Continue to inch closer to Alice's value while maintaining a clear goal of saving money. 
* **Counteroffer justification:**  Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer (splitting the difference) and expresses confidence in reaching an agreement, indicating he's serious about buying the product.
* **Remaining rounds:** Bob has 7 rounds left, which allows him to be more assertive in his negotiation."
