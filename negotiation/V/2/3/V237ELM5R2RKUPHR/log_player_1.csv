Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves $100,000 of profit for Bob. 
* This offer is strategically chosen to:
    * Maximize my potential profit. If Bob accepts, I make a $400,000 profit.
    * Maintain a good chance of Bob accepting. He still gets a significant value from the deal.
    * Provide a strong alternative if Bob rejects. I can still sell to John for $1,000,000.

By offering a price that is attractive to Bob while still being advantageous to me, I increase the likelihood of securing a better deal than selling to John."
