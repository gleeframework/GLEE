"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11500. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored just for you, considering its immense value to you at $10000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price.  

There's always the option to buy from John, but negotiation with Alice could lead to a lower price than $10,000."
