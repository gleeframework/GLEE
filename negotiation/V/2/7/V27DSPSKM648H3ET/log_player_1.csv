**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting his current offer would mean losing $50,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's strategically better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk a lower final offer from Bob."
