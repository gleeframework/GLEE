"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1200000 is a bit high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1150000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in this product. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in it, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1125000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to the table.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
