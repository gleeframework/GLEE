"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. $85 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you do $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
