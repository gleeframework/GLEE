Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $100 as possible since we have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $99 leaves a slight possibility for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting us closer to $100.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While it's above Bob's perceived value of $80, it's close enough that he might be tempted if he sees value in the product that wasn't immediately apparent. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
