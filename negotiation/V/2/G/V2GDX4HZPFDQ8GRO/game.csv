"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $1,200,000? I'm serious about this purchase and I believe this offer is a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
