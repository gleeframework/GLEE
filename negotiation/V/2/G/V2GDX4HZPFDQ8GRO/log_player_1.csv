Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $1,200,000? I'm serious about this purchase and I believe this offer is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer is $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a good deal for me and it seems like Bob is serious about purchasing the product."
