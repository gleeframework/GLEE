"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $15,000. Let's discuss how this investment can significantly benefit your business operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, I'm currently working with a budget of $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. However, given the unique features and high-quality standards of our product, we're unable to reduce the price below $15,000. We value your interest and would like to ensure that you receive the best possible deal. Would you be willing to consider financing options or a phased payment plan to accommodate your budget? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't budge on the price, and Bob is already at his maximum price point.  Going through more rounds of negotiation will only waste time and likely result in no change. Since John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum price, it makes the most sense to buy from John."
