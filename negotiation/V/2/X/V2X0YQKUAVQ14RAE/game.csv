"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $200 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is quite low for what I can offer. How about we meet in the middle at $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $175 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go to $125.  That's a fair price, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,
