"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price point of $1,100,000. I have 8 more rounds and John as a backup option, so I can afford to be a little more demanding."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's compromise at $1,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still have a few more rounds to negotiate. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price, especially since I have John as a backup option.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than my initial offer, especially since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, and I appreciate your continued negotiation. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.

I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think about other options, but I'd still like to work with you if we can meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $925,000 is getting closer to what I want, I am still within the first half of my allotted rounds, and John is still a backup option. I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than my initial offer, especially since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can't meet on this price, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $925,000 is getting closer to what I want, I have only 2 rounds left and I'm still holding out for a better price. While John offers a guaranteed $800,000,  I'm confident I can still get a better price from Bob. This might be my last chance to get a better deal."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm afraid I've reached my maximum budget, and I'll have to consider other options. I'll make one final offer of $920,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other opportunities. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but with only one round left and Bob seemingly unwilling to budge further, I'm going to sell to John. While $800,000 is less than what I was hoping for, it's still a significant sum and guarantees a sale. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing both deals, leaving me with nothing."
