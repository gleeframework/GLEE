"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,100,000.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's compromise at $1,000,000.  This price still provides you with substantial value, and it gives me a fair return on my investment.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, and I appreciate your continued negotiation. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle once again at $975,000. This price offers a significant benefit to you while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think about other options, but I'd still like to work with you if we can meet on this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear your concerns about the price. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I believe this will allow us to finalize this deal.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can't meet on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",925000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is getting down to the wire. I'm willing to compromise once more and offer the product for $940,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal. This is my final offer.",940000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm afraid I've reached my maximum budget, and I'll have to consider other options. I'll make one final offer of $920,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",920000.0,Bob,10,
