"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to work with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product at a price of $1400000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum. He should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to work with you,  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates that he is serious about negotiating and willing to walk away.  The offer of $1,250,000 is still below his maximum, but leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price we're willing to accept, considering the product's value to us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum.  He has two better options:

1. **Reject and counteroffer:**  Bob can continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his desired $1,200,000.
2. **Buy from John:**  Bob can secure the product for his maximum price by buying from John. This guarantees a successful purchase within his budget. 

Rejecting and counteroffering keeps the negotiation going, while still leaving the option to buy from John if the negotiations don't produce a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer.  I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be at $1,300,000.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stay within budget:** Bob is still below his maximum price of $1,200,000, leaving room for some potential compromise.
* **Show progress:** The counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet Alice halfway, moving closer to her position but not fully conceding.
* **Maintain pressure:**  By not accepting Alice's offer, Bob keeps the pressure on her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to compromise. After re-evaluating our options, we're willing to meet you at $1290000. This is the lowest price we're willing to accept, considering the product's value to us. We believe this price is fair and reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  At this point, Bob has several factors to consider:

* **Limited rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, the time to negotiate is shrinking. 
* **John's offer:** John is offering the product at Bob's desired price, guaranteeing a successful purchase within his budget. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her raising the price again or not agreeing to a lower price.

Given the risk of further negotiation and the certainty of a successful purchase from John, Bob should choose to buy from John."
