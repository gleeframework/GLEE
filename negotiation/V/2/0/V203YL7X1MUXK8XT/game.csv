"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth significantly more to me than $10,000. I could come down to $12,500, which is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
