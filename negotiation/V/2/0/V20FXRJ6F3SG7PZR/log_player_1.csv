"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive and friendly message helps build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the product's ""amazing"" qualities subtly hints at its value, without revealing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Profit:** While $80 is my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  There's no point in selling at my absolute bottom line when I have 8 rounds left.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can gauge his true interest level and see if he's willing to go higher. 
* **Setting the Pace:**  This rejection shows Bob I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and while $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? This is still a great value for the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still proposing a price higher than my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price and avoid appearing too eager to sell.
* **Realistic Counter:** $90 is a reasonable compromise that shows flexibility while still leaving room for potential further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and his offer is a fair midpoint between our previous positions.
* **Time Consideration:** We are now in Round 4, and while I could try to push for a higher price, it's likely Bob might become less interested, and I risk having to sell to John for $80.  It's better to secure a reasonable profit now."
