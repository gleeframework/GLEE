"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the returns you'll see. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet halfway. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
