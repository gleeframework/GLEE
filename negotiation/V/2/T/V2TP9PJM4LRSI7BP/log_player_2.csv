The product is worth more than $800,000 to you, but Alice's offer is too high. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than your ideal price. You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's room for Alice to come down further. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer is still above your desired price, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor concessions. At this point, buying from John for $800,000 is the more sensible choice, as it guarantees you the product within your budget."
