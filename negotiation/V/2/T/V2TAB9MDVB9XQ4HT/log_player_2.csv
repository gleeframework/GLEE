"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,500,000 to me. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but I'm not quite ready to meet your asking price.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** My goal is to buy for the lowest possible price.  A significantly lower counter-offer puts the pressure on Alice and gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I don't want to offer too close to my maximum ($800,000) right away.  This way I can increase my offer in subsequent rounds if needed.
* **Polite but Firm:** I want to maintain a positive tone but be clear that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While that's a move in the right direction, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** Alice is willing to move on price, so continued negotiation seems promising.
* **Significant Increase:**  I increased my offer by $100,000 to show I'm serious about finding a compromise.
* **Targeting Below My Maximum:** My offer is still comfortably below my $800,000 maximum, leaving me room to negotiate further if needed. 
* **Seeking a Fair Deal:**  I want to emphasize that I'm looking for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'll counteroffer at $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has come down in price, but her concessions are getting smaller. It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $900,000.
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:**  I know for sure I can get the product for $800,000 from John. 
* **Saving Money:**  Why risk further negotiation with Alice when I can save $100,000 right now by going with John?

It's time to cut my losses with Alice and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
