"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,500,000 to me. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but I'm not quite ready to meet your asking price.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While that's a move in the right direction, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'll counteroffer at $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
