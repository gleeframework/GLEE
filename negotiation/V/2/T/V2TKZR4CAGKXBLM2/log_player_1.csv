Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting at $140 aims to get the highest price Bob might be willing to pay before resorting to John's guaranteed $150. 
* **Slight Negotiation Buffer:** The offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive, while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By not revealing you have another buyer, the message hints at the offer being time-sensitive, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
