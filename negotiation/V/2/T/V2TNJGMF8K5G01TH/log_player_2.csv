"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $110, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer of $110 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80, he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I can only go up to $80 for this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80.  While it's getting closer, Bob should keep trying to negotiate a lower price, as he has time and the option to buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. $100 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and meet at $90? I'm serious about buying this, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $90 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I need to make a bit more on this.  How about $95? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer of $95 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Given that Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $80, it's the most logical choice at this point. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks running out of rounds before a mutually acceptable price is reached."
