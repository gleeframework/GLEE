"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll sell it to you for $10,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Alice,5,
