Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This is still a significant price for me, but it's within my budget and a fair price considering my needs.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
