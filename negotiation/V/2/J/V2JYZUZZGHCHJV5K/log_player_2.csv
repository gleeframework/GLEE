"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can do better than $12,000.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price of $12,000. It's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation.  The goal is to find a price point where both parties are satisfied.  This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than his alternative price of $15,000 from John.  While further negotiation is always possible,  the risk of Alice walking away or Bob exceeding his budget with John means accepting this offer is the most strategic decision."
