"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for it.  This is my maximum offer, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1600000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get this deal done. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my maximum offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your maximum offer of $1200000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for continuing to work with me on this.  $1400000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $1200000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  While $1300000 is getting closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us if you come down to my maximum offer of $1200000.  Let's close this deal and make this happen!",1200000.0,Bob,8,
