{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,250,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  With only one round left, it's unlikely I'll be able to convince Alice to lower her price further.  Therefore, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John at $1,200,000, as it guarantees I'll get the product within my budget."
