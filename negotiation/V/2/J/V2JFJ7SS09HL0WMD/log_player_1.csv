"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is above my minimum threshold, I believe I can secure a higher price.  Bob has shown interest, and I'm confident we can reach a more favorable deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and we are getting closer to a deal. Accepting his offer of $9,500 would be a good outcome, as it's significantly higher than selling to John.  While I could potentially get a higher price, it's important to consider the remaining rounds and the risk of not reaching a deal at all."
