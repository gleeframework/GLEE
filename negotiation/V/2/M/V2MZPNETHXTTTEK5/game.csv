"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $90 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
