"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer who is ready to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and inflate the product's value to you. While she claims it's worth $1,000,000 to you, you have no independent verification of that.  

More importantly, she reveals she has another buyer willing to pay $800,000. This suggests:

* **Her walk-away price is likely lower than $900,000.** She's using the other offer as leverage.
* **You might be able to get the product for a better price** if you reject her initial offer and negotiate.

Since your alternative is buying from John for $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate with Alice without exceeding your budget."
