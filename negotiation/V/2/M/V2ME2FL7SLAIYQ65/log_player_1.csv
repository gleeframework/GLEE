Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but not so high that it seems unreasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** My message highlights the value of the product to Bob, hoping to sway him towards accepting.
* **The ""John"" Factor:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob tries to lowball me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth to me. How about we discuss a price of $950,000? I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I want to get for the product.
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially since I have John as a backup buyer.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to our target, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my initial offer.
* **Reasonable Price:** It's a price that's still significantly higher than Bob's initial valuation but allows for a potential deal.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price higher than my minimum acceptable value.
* **Focus on Fairness:** Highlighting the ""fair compromise"" aspect may sway Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. However, I still believe we can find a solution that better aligns with my budget. Considering the value of the product to me, how about we aim for $1,025,000? I hope this proposal will be more suitable for us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is just $25,000 below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Potential Deal:**  While I would ideally prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids further negotiation.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will become unwilling to budge, potentially leading to a stalemate.  
* **Backup Buyer:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, having John as a backup buyer gives me a safety net if the deal with Bob falls through."
