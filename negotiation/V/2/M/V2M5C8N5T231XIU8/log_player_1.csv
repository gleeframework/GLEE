"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $115 for this product.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering my offer. This should make it more appealing for Bob to close the deal, especially since we're still early in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to offer $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm glad we're getting closer.  $110 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $112.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise and could encourage Bob to accept."
