"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its value and potential impact on your endeavors, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $14,000. This represents a substantial saving compared to its market value of $15,000, and I am confident it will provide you with a competitive edge. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information to make your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is a good one, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her, potentially saving even more money.  If Alice doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John."
