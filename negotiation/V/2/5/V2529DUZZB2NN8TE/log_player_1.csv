Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $75.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $80.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get a bit more, $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob is offering that.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations or having to sell to John at the same price."
