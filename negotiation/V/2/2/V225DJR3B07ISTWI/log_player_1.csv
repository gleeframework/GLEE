{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product at a price that I believe is fair for both of us. Considering its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. $900,000 is still far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give away the product for less than it's worth to me.  I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I receive a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm offering $1,000,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and shows my commitment to making this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is getting closer to what I'd like, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer one more time, but if Bob doesn't come up, I'm going to sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us, but I'm not willing to drop below $1,000,000. This is my final offer.
