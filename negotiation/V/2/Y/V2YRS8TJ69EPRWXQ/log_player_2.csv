**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting the product for an even lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the information you've shared about the product.  $14,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12000 is your target price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is a good price considering my target was $12,000. It's still below my maximum budget of $15,000, and I'm confident that this product is valuable enough to warrant accepting the offer."
