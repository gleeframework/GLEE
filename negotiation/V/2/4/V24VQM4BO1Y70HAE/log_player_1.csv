Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm also hoping to gauge Bob's interest in the product at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get a bit more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a fair price that still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my initial counteroffer of $135.  It's also more than what John is offering.  I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
