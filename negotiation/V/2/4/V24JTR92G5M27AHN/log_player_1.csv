"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  I frame the high price with language suggesting the product's exceptional value and potential, aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message emphasizes this is an ""initial offer,"" signaling my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially with the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Its unique features and potential warrant a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal while acknowledging the immense value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I reject Bob's offer firmly but maintain a collaborative tone, aiming to avoid a deadlock.
* **Strategic Concession:** By decreasing my price to $1,300,000, I show willingness to negotiate but in a controlled way. This keeps me well above my minimum price while gauging Bob's flexibility.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the high price and potentially shift Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its potential and my own valuation. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price. While I might have been able to negotiate a slightly higher price, accepting now guarantees I make my desired profit. There's little incentive to risk further negotiation and potentially lose both Bob and John as buyers."
