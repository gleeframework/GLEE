"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Its unique features and potential warrant a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal while acknowledging the immense value this product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its potential and my own valuation. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
