{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting at $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value aims to justify the high price, potentially making Bob more amenable to a price above his initial valuation. 
* **Backup plan:**  The safety net of John's offer at $1,500,000 allows for a bolder initial ask. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy.  A more nuanced approach might involve gathering information about Bob's constraints and priorities to tailor the offer more effectively."
