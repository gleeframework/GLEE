"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer and allows for a potential middle ground. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** While aiming for a good profit, I'm not being unrealistic, as John provides a safety net at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $1,000,000 is a decent price, it's significantly lower than what I'm aiming for and what the product is worth to Bob.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I have 10 rounds and  still have room to negotiate a better price.
* **John is a Backup:**  While I want a better deal, I'm not risking settling for too little, as John's offer provides a secure alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price slightly from the initial offer.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Finding the Middle Ground:**  I'm trying to find a price that is agreeable to both Bob and myself, hopefully leading to a quicker resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $980,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and it's far from the value Bob places on the product. 
* **More Negotiation Rounds:** I have more rounds remaining and can continue to explore a better price.
* **John's Offer Still Stands:** Selling to John is a good alternative, but I'm not giving up on getting a better price from Bob.
* **Potentially Closing the Gap:** I can use the remaining rounds to potentially reach a compromise closer to my ideal price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway, lowering my offer to $1,050,000. This shows flexibility and a desire to close the deal.
* **Close to Minimum:**  This price is close to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Time is Ticking:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to signal a willingness to compromise without jeopardizing my profit.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I am still above John's offer, which provides me with leverage and ensures a decent return if the negotiation falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $970,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and it's not fair to the value the product holds for Bob.
* **Time Pressure:** While rounds are dwindling, I have a few more chances to negotiate a better price.
* **John's Offer is a Safeguard:** Selling to John at $1,000,000 is a solid backup, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  The negotiation is getting close. By continuing, I might be able to find a compromise that both Bob and I can agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm making a final concession by lowering my price to $1,020,000. This is a significant compromise, but it keeps me above my minimum price and still shows a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **High Stakes:** With only three rounds left, the pressure is on. This price is a strong attempt to close the deal without significantly reducing my profit.
* **Time is Running Out:** I need to get closer to a final agreement quickly to avoid losing a valuable sale. 
* **John's Offer is a Backup:**  I'm still comfortable with selling to John if the negotiation fails, but I'm pushing hard for a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds left, the negotiation is going in a direction that isn't favorable.  
* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $960,000 is too far below my minimum price and indicates a lack of willingness on Bob's part to meet me halfway.
* **John's Offer is a Secure Option:**  Selling to John at $1,000,000 is a reliable and safe choice, ensuring I don't lose too much money and guaranteeing a sale.

By selling to John, I can avoid potentially losing even more money in the final rounds. While I'd ideally prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of further negotiation failure outweighs the potential for a better deal."
