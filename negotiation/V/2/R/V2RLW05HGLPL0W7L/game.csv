I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get this valuable item for a price that's significantly lower than its true worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
