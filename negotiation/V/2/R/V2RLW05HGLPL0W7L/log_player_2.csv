"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get this valuable item for a price that's significantly lower than its true worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better deal than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a good deal for Bob. This price is still within Bob's budget of $15,000 and is significantly lower than John's price.  It's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate further and get a better deal than this."
