"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $800,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, but I'm willing to give you a better deal than my initial offer. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $750,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. After re-evaluating the product's value again, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, but I'm willing to give you a better deal than my previous offer. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
