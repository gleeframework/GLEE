,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $80.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",80.0,Bob,4,
