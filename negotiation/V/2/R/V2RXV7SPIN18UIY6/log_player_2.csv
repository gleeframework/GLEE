"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm selling. I'm looking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it's wise to reject Alice's initial offer of $100.  You can always buy from John for $100 if negotiations with Alice fail, so there's no risk in trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts by acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing interest in the product. By offering $75, you're making a significant counterproposal while leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially secure a deal that's beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than Alice's initial offer of $100, it's still above your desired price point of $100.  Since you have John as a backup, there's no need to rush into accepting Alice's offer. You can continue negotiating with Alice, aiming to get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $80.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows continued interest in the product while demonstrating a willingness to compromise. By offering $80, you're getting closer to Alice's price while still leaving some room for negotiation. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
