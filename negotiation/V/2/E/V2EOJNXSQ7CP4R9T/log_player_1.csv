# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While the product is attractive, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
