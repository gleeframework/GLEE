# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,075,000:** This is a significant drop from her initial offer of $1,100,000 and is within Bob's budget. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away or that Bob will be forced to buy from John for a higher price.
* **Time and Effort:**  Each round of negotiation takes time and effort, and it's not guaranteed that further negotiation will lead to a significantly better outcome.

Considering all these factors, accepting Alice's offer of $1,075,000 seems like the most logical decision for Bob. It allows him to purchase the product for a lower price than John's offer while minimizing the risk and effort involved in further negotiation."
