"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset to you.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,500? That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,500:** This is lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject and he'd have to pay John's price.
* **Saving money:**  Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John. 

It's a reasonable compromise to secure the product without taking an unnecessary risk."
