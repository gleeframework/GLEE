{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset to you.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's attractive to Bob:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate a price that benefits both of us. 
* **It sets a clear starting point:** By making the first offer, I establish the framework for the negotiation.

I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'll also be prepared to sell to John if the negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,500? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
