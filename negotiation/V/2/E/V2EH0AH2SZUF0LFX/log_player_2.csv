"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is still a significant amount above your target of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting the offer and trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your target:**  While Alice has come down in price, $1,150,000 is still higher than your desired $1,000,000.
* **Potential for further savings:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and you might be able to secure a lower price with another counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John for now:** Buying from John is a fallback option, but you still have several rounds left to potentially get a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,150,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000.  Let's split the difference and reach an agreement.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. Considering the value of the product to you and the time we've invested in negotiations, I'm willing to offer $1,175,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further discussions if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:**  $1,175,000 is still higher than your desired $1,000,000, and you're only in round 5.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Alice has stated that she is open to further discussions, indicating there is still room to negotiate.
* **Avoid buying from John:**  Buying from John is a fallback option, and you still have several rounds left to potentially get a better deal with Alice.

**Strategy:**  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  Alice has shown a willingness to come down, and you might be able to get closer to your target price with another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,150,000.  We've both moved closer to a compromise, and I believe this price reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,165,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,165,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,165,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $1,165,000 is very close to your desired $1,000,000.  You've already saved a significant amount from the initial $1,200,000.
* **Limited time:**  You only have 3 rounds left.  If you reject this offer, there's a risk Alice might not budge further, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Potential for compromise:** While you'd prefer a lower price, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and has already made significant concessions. It's likely you won't get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:** It's time to close the deal.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price within the remaining time."
