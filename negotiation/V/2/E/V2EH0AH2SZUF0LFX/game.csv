"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,150,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000.  Let's split the difference and reach an agreement.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. Considering the value of the product to you and the time we've invested in negotiations, I'm willing to offer $1,175,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further discussions if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,150,000.  We've both moved closer to a compromise, and I believe this price reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,165,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1165000.0,Alice,7,
