"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $13,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
