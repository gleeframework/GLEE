"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe you'll find it a great addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you can buy the product for $8,000 from John, there's no reason to pay $8,500 to Alice. You should reject her offer and go with the better deal."
