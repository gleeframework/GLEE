Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 from John, we want to find a price that Bob might accept while exceeding our minimum.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also anchors the price closer to our desired outcome. 
* **Value Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" without revealing specifics that might weaken our negotiating position. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is a single-round negotiation. We don't know if Bob will have a chance to counter-offer. 
* Bob's acceptance depends on many factors beyond our knowledge (his budget, urgency, perceived value, etc.)."
