"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should incentivize Bob to accept but also allows me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
