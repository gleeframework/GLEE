"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Let's negotiate to see if we can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for us to potentially meet in the middle and get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, we can still try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $7,750?  That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to move upward, but still aims for a price significantly below her last offer and John's alternative price."
