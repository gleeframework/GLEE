"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. This leaves ample room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but well above my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message frames the offer as a starting point, emphasizing a collaborative approach to finding a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  While I haven't mentioned John explicitly, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both my minimum ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $1,075,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:**  While I'm moving closer to the middle ground, I'm making it clear that $900,000 is far too low.
* **Compromise:**  By coming down to $1,075,000, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate but also holding firm on a price that's still very profitable.
* **Time Constraint:**  With several rounds left, I'm comfortable setting a firm price for now, knowing I can always adjust slightly if needed in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,000,000.  If you're willing to meet that, I'll buy the product right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my absolute minimum price of $1,000,000. While I might have been able to push for a slightly higher amount in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee. Accepting this offer secures the sale at my desired minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further prolonging the negotiation."
