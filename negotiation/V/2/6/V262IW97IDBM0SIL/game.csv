"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. I hope this works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
