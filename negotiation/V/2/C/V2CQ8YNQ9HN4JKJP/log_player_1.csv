Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it's a fantastic deal and would be very valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $10,000 (my minimum), there's a chance Bob would accept a slightly lower price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down a bit. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The offer is still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, increasing the likelihood he'll see it as a good deal if he needs the product.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a higher price and ensuring I don't miss out on the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
