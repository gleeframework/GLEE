"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1600000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1500000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet in the middle at $1550000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1300000 and $1550000, which would be $1425000. Can you consider this offer?",1425000.0,Bob,6,
