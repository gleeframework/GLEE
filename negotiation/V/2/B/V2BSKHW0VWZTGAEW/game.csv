"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,250 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort you're putting into the negotiation. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8250.0,Bob,4,
