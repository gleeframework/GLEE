"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.",95.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not sure $95 is a good fit for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.,92.5,Bob,4,
