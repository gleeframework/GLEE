{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $1,300,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at least at this price to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $1280000.
