"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this unique product.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe the product's value is higher than $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $1300000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is enough. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I understand your target price, $1250000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1225000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the final price I can afford.  Let's close this deal!",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at least at this price to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $1280000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
