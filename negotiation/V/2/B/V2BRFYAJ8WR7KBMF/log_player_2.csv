While I'm not at liberty to disclose the exact nature of the product, I can assure you it holds significant potential.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,750,000.  This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it represents a strong investment opportunity for you.  Consider this offer carefully, as I have other potential buyers eager to make a purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.
