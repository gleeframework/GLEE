"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $10,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go down to $10,500. I'm willing to make another compromise.
