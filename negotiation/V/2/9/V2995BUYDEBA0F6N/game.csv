"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000 to show my commitment to this deal.  It's a fair price considering the product's unique value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
