Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the product's worth to both of us. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While $800,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? It's a good compromise, and it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000. Would you consider $825,000? That seems like a reasonable final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $825,000 is a decent compromise and reflects the value Bob places on the product. It's also a significant improvement over his initial offer. It's time to close the deal."
