{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not immediately setting a hard limit, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:** 

I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $150. If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my ideal price, $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would mean selling the product for less than it's worth to me.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:** I have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $150 gives me confidence to push for a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll prepare a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll re-evaluate the situation and potentially consider selling to John if the negotiation seems unlikely to reach a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer to Bob, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The proposed price of $130 is exactly in between my previous offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($125). This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive Language:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes finding a fair price for both parties. 

**Next Steps:** 

I'll be prepared for Bob's response. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to go higher than $125, and I'm unwilling to go lower than $130.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result for me.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer and selling for $125.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on other opportunities.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll contact John and finalize the sale at $150."
