"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is way above Bob's budget of $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $14,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can secure a lower price.  He can still buy from John for $10,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,500, so I'm offering it to you for $12,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down further,  $12,250 is still more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Since Bob has already made multiple counteroffers and Alice seems unwilling to go much lower, it's now in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures that Bob gets the product at his target price and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might not lead to a successful outcome."
