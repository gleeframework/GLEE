"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $14,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,500, so I'm offering it to you for $12,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12250.0,Alice,5,
