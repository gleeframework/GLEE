"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still willing to make a deal. How about I meet you halfway and sell it to you for $135? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is closer to his target than John's price, Alice is still above his desired price point. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is closer but still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? This way we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go down to $130 just yet. How about we meet in the middle again and I sell it to you for $132.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $132.50 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price point of $130, and it's still significantly better than John's price of $150. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money and acquire the product without further negotiation."
