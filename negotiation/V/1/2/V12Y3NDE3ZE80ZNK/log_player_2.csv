"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice at $1,200,000 would not save you any money. 
* Buying from John at $1,200,000 would also not save you any money. 
* The best option is to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John. This gives you the flexibility to negotiate with Alice or find other sellers.  The goal is to save money, and neither offer provides any savings."
