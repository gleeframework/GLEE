Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he's truly interested, he may counter with a lower offer, giving me a chance to meet somewhere in the middle. However, if he rejects outright, I can quickly switch to John and secure my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get more from him.  It's more efficient to sell to John and secure my desired amount immediately."
