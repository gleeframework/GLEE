Bob's offer is too low. There's a lot of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

While it's not the absolute highest we could get, $850,000 is a substantial profit over John's offer.  It's a good balance point between maximizing profit and closing the deal."
