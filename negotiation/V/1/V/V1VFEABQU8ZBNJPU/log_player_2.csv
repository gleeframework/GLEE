``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000). I should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's room for both of us to find a price that works better."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad to hear that you're interested in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?
