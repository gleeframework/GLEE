"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad to hear that you're interested in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of the product.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000.  Would you consider a price of $1,000,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get a price that reflects the product's true value to you. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
