"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,400,000 is certainly a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ would you consider $1,600,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price point. We are still in a position to negotiate further, and accepting his offer now would mean leaving money on the table.  We are aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,450,000? This recognizes the value of the product while being fair to both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm getting close to my maximum budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000? I'm trying to find a sweet spot for both of us.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has repeated his previous offer, indicating he may be getting more firm in his pricing. However, we still have room to negotiate and can try to push him slightly higher. We are getting close to the point where accepting John's offer might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position and your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but this is my final offer. Would you consider $1,375,000?"",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're making a smaller concession this round to signal that we're reaching our limit. This offer is a final attempt to secure a price significantly higher than John's offer. If Bob rejects this, we should strongly consider taking John's offer in the next round to avoid the risk of Bob walking away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to accept this price, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached his absolute limit, matching John's offer.  There is no longer any potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum acceptable price without further risk or delay."
