"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm excited to see if we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and am interested, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford without exceeding my budget.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $12,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the last time I'm willing to budge, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final price of $12,300 for the product.",12300.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $12,300, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,300 and my minimum price of $12,000. Let's try $12,150. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12150.0,Alice,9,
