"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $90?  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $105.  What do you say?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $105. I'm willing to meet you at $107.50, but that's as low as I can go.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my limit is $102.50.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I want to make a deal happen. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum. How about $105.25?",105.25,Alice,7,
