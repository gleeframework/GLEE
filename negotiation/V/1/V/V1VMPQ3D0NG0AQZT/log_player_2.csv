"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

The offer is significantly higher than both my budget and John's offer. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit too steep for me, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm on a tighter budget. How about $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's low enough to give room for negotiation while still signaling a serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price for a unique item like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, the price is still above John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer inches closer to Alice's price while still staying below John's offer. It keeps the negotiation moving and signals my willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a fair price for a unique item like this, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is now small enough that it's more sensible to buy from John at the guaranteed price of $8,000."
