"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
