Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $825,000, a saving of $175,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Alice's Final Offer:** She's indicated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away, leaving you with John's less favorable offer."
