$20,000 is far above my budget. I'll try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start low and see if Alice is willing to come down. $10,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

$17,000 is still too high, but closer to my budget. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

Alice seems to be flexible, so I'll offer $13,000. It's still a significant discount from her latest offer, but it's closer to my budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$15,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay, but I see a possibility of getting it closer to my budget. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'll offer $14,000. It's a compromise between Alice's latest offer and my maximum budget. If she's still too far from my desired price, I'll consider going with John in the next round."
