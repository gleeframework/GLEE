# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of its worth. However, considering my budget and the current market situation, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,000,000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower offer? I am willing to pay up to $1,800,000 for the product.
