"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice. I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  How about $700,000? That's a significant move on my part.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $700,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
