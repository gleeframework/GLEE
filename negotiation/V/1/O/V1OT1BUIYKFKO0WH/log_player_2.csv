"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $700,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  It's better to secure the product at John's price of $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
