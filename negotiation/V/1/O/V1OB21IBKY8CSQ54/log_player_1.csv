Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it's worth more than what Bob might perceive.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, there's no need to reveal this information to Bob.  Keeping your options open strengthens your position.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and suggests you're open to discussing the price further if Bob counters."
