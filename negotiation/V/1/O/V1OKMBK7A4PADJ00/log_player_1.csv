Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford $20,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $14,000?  This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is still higher than I can comfortably afford, I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $12,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still at my limit with $10,000. This is a significant commitment for me, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal.  Would you be willing to consider my offer?

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly from his $10,000 offer. It's clear that this is his ceiling, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a potential $5,000.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
