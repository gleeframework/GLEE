"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you'll get it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll still make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
