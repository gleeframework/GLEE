"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He has rounds left and can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay under $90, so how about $90?  It's a fair price that should work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay under $90, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $100. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $100 is getting closer, it's still more than he wants to pay. He can try to counteroffer one more time before deciding to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go to $95, which is a fair compromise.  It's my final offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $97.50. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of rounds and is still above his target price.  While he could continue negotiating, it's likely the price will not drop below $90.  It's more efficient to buy from John and save the time and energy."
