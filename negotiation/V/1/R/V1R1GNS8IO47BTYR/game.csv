,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay under $90, so how about $90?  It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay under $90, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $100. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go to $95, which is a fair compromise.  It's my final offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $97.50. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",97.5,Alice,7,
