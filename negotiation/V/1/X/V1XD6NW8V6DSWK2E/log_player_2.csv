"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm offering it at $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high.  It's important to bring the price down significantly. Buying from John right now would be accepting defeat too early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. Considering the value this product offers, I can come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer, reflecting the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but very slowly. Her price is still far too high. We need to encourage her to move towards a more reasonable price point. We're not yet at a point where giving up and going to John is the right move."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $2,000,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be reasonable. What do you say we meet in the middle somewhere?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

This counter-offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Signals a limit:** By stating that $1,000,000 is ""reasonable,"" we're subtly hinting at our upper limit (John's price). 
* **Encourages larger movement:**  Suggesting a middle ground might prompt Alice to make a more substantial reduction in her asking price. 
* **Maintains a polite and collaborative tone:** We want to keep the negotiation moving without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward about your budget.  I want to find a solution that works for both of us, but to be transparent, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has made a more substantial reduction this time, but the price is still too high. It's clear she's aware of our budget limitations, so we need to hold firm and see if we can push her down further. We still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the step down, and I do want to find a way to make this work. However, to be frank, $1,750,000 is still a significant stretch for me. How about we try $1,250,000? That feels like a more reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Splits the difference:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($1,750,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,000,000). This shows a willingness to move but maintains a firm position.
* **Direct and honest:** We're being upfront about the price being a ""stretch"" while reiterating our desire to find a solution. 
* **Time pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, this offer encourages Alice to make a decision and potentially meet closer to our desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we both see the value in this product, and I believe we're close to a deal that benefits us both. To bridge the gap, I can accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tricky spot. Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while it's still higher than we'd like, it's a reasonable compromise. However, we're only $600,000 away from John's price. There's a chance Alice is bluffing to get us to fold. We'll push one more time and see if she's serious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're close. And I respect that you've made concessions to get us here.  However, to make this work on my end, I need to be at $1,300,000. That's the absolute best I can do.  I think it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Acknowledge the ""final offer"":** We don't directly contradict Alice, but we also don't accept it.  
* **Significant but justified movement:** We're moving up a considerable $50,000 from our last offer, showing serious intent.  
* **""Absolute best"" language:**  This creates a sense that we're at our limit, adding weight to the counteroffer.  
* **Still room to go to John:** If Alice rejects this, we can still go with John and lose a relatively small amount compared to Alice's offer."
