Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. I'm open to discussing the price further if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always best to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest and give you an idea of his perceived value of the product. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  By stating you're ""open to discussing the price,"" you signal willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting his offer guarantees you the best possible outcome in this scenario."
