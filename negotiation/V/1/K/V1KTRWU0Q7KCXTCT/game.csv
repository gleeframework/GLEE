"Alice, $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $15,000 might have been a bit high, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer before I explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,
