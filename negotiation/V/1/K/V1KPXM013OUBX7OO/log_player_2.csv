"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, you can likely get it for cheaper.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more on this product to make it worthwhile for me. How about $95?  It's still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is within my budget and a decent deal. It's only $5 more than my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the product by continuing to negotiate. I'm happy with this price."
