"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $8,900.  This price is fair to both of us, given the value you place on the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us and close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
