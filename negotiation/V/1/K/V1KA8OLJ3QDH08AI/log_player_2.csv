"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $9,500 is only $500 below your maximum price. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** There's room for Alice to lower her price, and you have 10 rounds to work with. 
* **John's offer is a backup.**  You can always fall back on John's $10,000 offer if negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still $1,000 more than what you're willing to pay. 
* **There's room for more negotiation.** Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and you can likely get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is still your backup.** It's good to have a backup plan if negotiations fall apart, but you're still hoping to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $8,900.  This price is fair to both of us, given the value you place on the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.**  You're looking to save as much as possible, and $8,900 is only $400 more than your ideal price.
* **Negotiating further is risky.**  You've already made several counteroffers, and there's a chance Alice might not budge further.
* **John's offer is still a backup.**  If this deal falls through, you can always buy from John, but the risk of losing this deal for a potential $100 savings doesn't seem worthwhile. 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a price that's reasonably close to your goal."
