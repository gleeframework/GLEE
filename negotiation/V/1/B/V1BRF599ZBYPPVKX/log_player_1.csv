Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Strong but Justified Price:** The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, justifying the high price tag. 

This strategy aims for a win-win situation: Bob gets a product he values highly, and you maximize your profit."
