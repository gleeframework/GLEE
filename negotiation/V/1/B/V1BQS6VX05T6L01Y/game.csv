"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, recognizing the value you see in the product. This is a fair compromise and still allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice's position, but I still feel that $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I would like to propose a price of $1,225,000. This still allows Alice a good profit while keeping the cost reasonable for me.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
