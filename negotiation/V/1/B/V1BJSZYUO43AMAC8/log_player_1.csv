Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth a guaranteed $1,000,000 to Alice, there's no risk in starting with a higher offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,500,000 leaves space for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still come down while remaining above her minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message focuses on the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price and pique Bob's interest. 

**Important Note:**  While John offers a safety net, this strategy aims to maximize profit with Bob, knowing Alice always has the option to sell to John at her minimum price."
