Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1450000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1600000 is closer, it's still above my budget. My final offer is $1500000. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll need to explore other options.

Bob's offer is my minimum value, and I'm running out of time. It's better to accept his offer than risk losing him completely and having to sell to John at the same price."
