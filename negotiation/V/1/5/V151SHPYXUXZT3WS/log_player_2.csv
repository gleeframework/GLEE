"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd ideally like to pay.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $100 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a decent price for the product.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go any lower.  It's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer or me having to buy from John at a higher price."
