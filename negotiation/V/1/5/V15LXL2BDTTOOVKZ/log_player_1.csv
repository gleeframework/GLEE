Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly.  I'm also keeping in mind the $1,500,000 offer from John, which serves as my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to close the deal at this price, but I'm prepared to go lower if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is still a good deal. It's higher than John's offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing both buyers.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
