Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with an offer higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer is primarily to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.  His response will tell you how aggressively you can negotiate.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly included in the message format, it's good practice to subtly highlight the product's value to Bob in your full communication. This could involve emphasizing features or benefits that align with his needs, potentially justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  How you proceed depends entirely on Bob's response. If he outright rejects the offer, you might consider a more moderate counter-offer before going to John."
