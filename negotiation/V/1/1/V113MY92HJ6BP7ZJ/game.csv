"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $7750. Can you consider that?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  However, $7750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8125.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $8125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7950, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",7950.0,Bob,6,
