"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $7750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $7,750 is still below my $8,000 threshold. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell just yet. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm going to see if I can get him to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  However, $7750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8,125.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $8125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7950, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,950 is only $50 away from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I could try to negotiate further, I'm running out of time (only 4 rounds left). I'm not confident I can get Bob to budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit."
