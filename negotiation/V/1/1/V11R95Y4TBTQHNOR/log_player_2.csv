"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. I think it's worth $12,000 to you, so I'm offering it at $11,000 to sweeten the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still significantly higher than Alice's valuation of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to meet Alice halfway, offering a price that's significantly closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving some room for further negotiation. This shows a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product to you is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than his ideal price point. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's still room to push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,750, which is closer to my initial offer and still a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to chip away at the price, offering a slightly higher amount than his previous counteroffer. This shows persistence and a willingness to find a middle ground, potentially leading to a successful negotiation."
