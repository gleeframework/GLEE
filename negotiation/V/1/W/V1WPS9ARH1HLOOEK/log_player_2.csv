{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He's offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still staying within a range that's likely to be acceptable to Alice. This counteroffer provides room for further negotiation, potentially leading to a price that is more favorable to Bob."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to her initial price, but Bob is still trying to save money. There's potential for more negotiation.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, he's still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's last offer. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and potentially brings the parties closer to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price point. While there's still room for negotiation, the risk of continuing to bargain is that Alice could become less willing to sell, or Bob could end up paying more if he has to buy from John.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer, as it's a good price and avoids the risk of a higher cost or losing the deal entirely."
