Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000 before considering other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for you.
* **Time Value & Alternative:** Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" subtly reminds Bob that you have a fallback option (John) and creates a sense of urgency. 

This approach balances ambition with a strategic understanding of the situation."
