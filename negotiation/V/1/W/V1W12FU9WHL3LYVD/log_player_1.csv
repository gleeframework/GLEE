Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with an offer of $10,000 leaves room for negotiation. It aims to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's high value without explicitly stating why Bob should pay above his perceived value. This leaves room for Bob to accept the offer outright or engage in a negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, ensuring no loss."
