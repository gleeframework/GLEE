This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate if needed. I'm leaving some room for a counteroffer but still maintaining a price close to my minimum acceptable value."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
