"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,100,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to come to a quick agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good value for my product. I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
