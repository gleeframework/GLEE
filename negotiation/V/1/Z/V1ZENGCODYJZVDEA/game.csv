"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm ready to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves some room for you to make a profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and the profit I need to make.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This offer represents a significant step towards a deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me. I'm eager to finalize this purchase.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target price. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a final compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and the profit I need to make.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $910,000 for the product.  This price reflects a significant investment on my end and represents a fair compromise.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer the product to you for $915,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",915000.0,Alice,7,
