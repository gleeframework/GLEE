"I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $750,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the product's true value and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering its value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the product's true worth, and it allows for a fair transaction for both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go up to $800,000. I think we're getting close to the price I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $800,000, so I'll offer $787,500 for the product. This is my final offer.",787500.0,Bob,6,
