"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation, but not too high to scare Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $140, still higher than Bob's offer but showing flexibility. I hope this will lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $135.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting close to my target and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round. It's also better than selling to John for $120."
