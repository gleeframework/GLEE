Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, aiming for my minimum value.  If Bob rejects, I'll see if he's serious about buying and adjust my offer accordingly.  But John is a good backup plan if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for significantly less than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see where we can land."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm dropping the price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will get Bob closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see if Bob is truly serious about buying. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final offer. It's still above my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John to ensure I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made several counteroffers.  I'm confident I can get my desired price from John, so I'll take his offer and end the negotiation."
