{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still gives me room to negotiate if necessary.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which could lead to a more positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  Let's split the difference. How about $130?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to go above $125, and while that's a decent price, I'm not comfortable going that low, especially since John is ready to buy it for my minimum. It's better to cut my losses with Bob and move on to a guaranteed sale."
