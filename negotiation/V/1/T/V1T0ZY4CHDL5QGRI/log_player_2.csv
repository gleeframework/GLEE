Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800000 is far below what this product is worth.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?
