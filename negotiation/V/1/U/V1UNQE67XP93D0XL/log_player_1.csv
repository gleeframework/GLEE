Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this product has great value, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?

While Bob's offer is higher than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. Could you consider a price of $1050000? I think this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and close to the $1,200,000 I was aiming for. It's a good compromise that balances value and budget."
