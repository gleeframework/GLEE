"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this product has great value, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? It's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and your budget.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1000000. Could you consider a price of $1050000? I think this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
