{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not giving it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for such a low price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm hoping we can find a price somewhere in the middle. How about $11,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and would like to continue negotiating. I would like to propose a price of $10,500. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring a valuable item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. Further negotiation might get me a bit more, but it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether.  $10,500 is still a decent profit considering my minimum value."
