"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good deal. Since the product is worth significantly more to me than Bob, I'm hoping to get a price closer to my value. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000 right now. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my value. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $950,000 is closer to my minimum goal. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting offers, I might lose the deal altogether and be forced to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's better to secure a slightly lower profit than risk getting nothing at all."
