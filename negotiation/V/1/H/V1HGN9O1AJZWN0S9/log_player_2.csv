"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still above your ideal budget. You have room to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $120, but I'm really looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $100, but I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $105, which is $112.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $112.50 is still a bit more than you want to spend.  There's still room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to meeting you in the middle, Bob. I can do $115, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the negotiation has gone back and forth a few times. While $115 is still a bit more than your ideal price, it's closer to your budget than John's offer of $150. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product within your acceptable price range, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate or Alice getting frustrated and walking away."
