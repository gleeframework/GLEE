"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get more from him, and I'm not willing to sell to John for less than my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still very reasonable considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and I'm not confident I can get him to come up to a price that's acceptable to me. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
