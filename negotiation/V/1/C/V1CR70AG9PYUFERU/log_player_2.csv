"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that can significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $9500 for it. This price reflects its worth while allowing us to reach a fair agreement. I believe this offer will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget for this purchase is $8,000. I'm confident this product will be valuable to me, but that's the maximum I can offer at this time."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. To try and accommodate your situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8500 for the product. This price still reflects its value while being more accessible to you. I hope this offer aligns better with your financial planning. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer, while closer to his budget, is still $500 more than his target.  He can likely negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a way to stay within my $8,000 limit.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,250? This would allow me to purchase the product while still ensuring I get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am pleased to counter with a price of $8400 for the product. This price maintains a balance between reflecting its value and accommodating your budget constraints. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the closest she's come to Bob's target, it's still $400 over his budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm very close to my budget limit, and I'm hoping we can find a way to close this deal.  Would you consider a final offer of $8,100?  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to get a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 8100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I've reviewed your last offer carefully, and I'm prepared to offer a price of $8300 for the product. This price respects the value of the product while remaining within your budget constraints. I hope this offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $300 above Bob's budget. At this point, the negotiation seems to be going in circles.  Bob has only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely he'll be able to get Alice down to $8,000. To guarantee he gets the product within his budget, it's best for Bob to purchase from John, as he's offering the product for Bob's target price."
