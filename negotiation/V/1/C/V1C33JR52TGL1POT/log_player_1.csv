Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). However, the phrasing emphasizes exclusivity and potential, aiming to persuade him.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy involves risk.  There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, and I'll miss out on the extra $50,000 I could have earned by going directly to John. 
*  Negotiation is possible. Bob might counter-offer, and I'll need to decide if I'm willing to go lower or stick to my minimum price."
