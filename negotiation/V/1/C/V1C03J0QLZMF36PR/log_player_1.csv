Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is still a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'm accepting the offer to finalize the deal."
