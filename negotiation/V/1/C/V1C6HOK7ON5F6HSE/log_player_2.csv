"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. I think this is a great deal, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Bob should aim to save as much money as possible. By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're highlighting. However, $8,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, and the price of $8,000 is now within a reasonable range for Bob.  Since Bob has a limited number of rounds and the alternative price from John is $10,000, it makes sense to accept the offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
