"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and our respective needs. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $980,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to accepting your offer to sell to John for $1,200,000. I think you'll find this price still represents a good value for the product. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that high.  While I value the product, I'm going to have to stick to my price of $900,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",900000.0,Bob,6,
