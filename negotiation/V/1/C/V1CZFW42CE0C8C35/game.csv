"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to move forward with the purchase. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm open to negotiation. I'd be willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $1,875,000 for the product.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let me know if you're open to this.",1875000.0,Bob,4,
