**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly refusing to go above $1,000,000.  While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of him, it's not worth the risk of him walking away entirely. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's time to take the sure thing."
