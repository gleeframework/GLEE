"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a living too. I can see that you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession. I'm not willing to go any lower than $11500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and dedicated support for the product.

"I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much on the deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",11000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you at $9500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",9500.0,Bob,10,
