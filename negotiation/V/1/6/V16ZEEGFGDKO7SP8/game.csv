"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still fair given the product's value, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $1,250,000.  This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while considering its fair value.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too far off for me.  Given the value of the product and our ongoing discussions, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $1,300,000 is definitely closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit short of my goal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions.  This is my final offer. ",1350000.0,Alice,7,
