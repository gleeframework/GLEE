Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.,100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $88.75. This would be a fair price for both of us.",88.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $88.75 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $90. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",90.0,Alice,5,
