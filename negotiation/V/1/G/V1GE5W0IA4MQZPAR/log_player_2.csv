"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $11,500. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John at the more favorable price of $10,000."
