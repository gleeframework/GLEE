"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that has been meticulously crafted and tailored to meet your specific needs. This product holds immense value to me, but its true worth lies in finding the right owner who will appreciate and utilize it to its fullest potential. Given its significance, I am extending this exclusive offer to you at a price of $800,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price considering the product's quality, rarity, and the substantial benefit it would bring to you. Please let me know if you require any additional information or have questions about the product. I am looking forward to the possibility of working together and sharing this exceptional item with someone who will cherish it as much as I have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a no-brainer. Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly less than your $1,000,000 maximum and a great deal less than John's offer."
