"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given your needs. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $950,000 signals that you're open to negotiation but still value the product highly. 
* **Focusing on Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, which can make him more amenable to a higher price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay close to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($800,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting would mean a significant loss for you. While selling to John is an option, there's still room to negotiate with Bob for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is significantly below the value I place on this product. To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a great deal considering the value it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** By lowering the price to $900,000, you signal to Bob that you're willing to negotiate and find common ground. 
* **Holding Firm:**  The $900,000 counteroffer remains strong and above your minimum acceptable price.  
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message reinforces the product's worth to Bob's business, aiming to justify the higher price point. 

This approach maintains a balance between finding a compromise and ensuring you don't undervalue your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value this product represents, and I am willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 matches both your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.  

* **Meeting Your Goal:** Accepting this offer ensures you achieve your goal of selling the product for at least $800,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through, leaving you to accept John's offer anyway.
* **Securing a Fair Deal:** Bob meeting you ""halfway"" suggests he's made a significant move and might not be willing to go much higher. 

Accepting now locks in a profitable outcome and avoids potential downsides of further negotiation."
