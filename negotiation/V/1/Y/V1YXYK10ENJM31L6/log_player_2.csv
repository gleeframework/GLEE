We're getting closer, but there's still room to negotiate. Alice is coming down, indicating a willingness to make a deal."

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price we can agree on, but we can still push for a better deal.  We'll counter just below her offer to signal our interest while continuing to negotiate downwards."
