Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide to accept, slightly reduce the price, or walk away knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than Bob's perceived $10,000. This could make Bob more receptive to a price higher than his initial valuation. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to ensure a sale, offering a price closer to $15,000 would be a safer bet."
