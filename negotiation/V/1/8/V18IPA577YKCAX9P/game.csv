"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a lower price, and I get to move this quickly. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,000,000? This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
