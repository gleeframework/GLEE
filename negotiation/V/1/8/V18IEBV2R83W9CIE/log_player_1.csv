Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This allows for some room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Message:**  I'm framing it as a ""win-win"" situation, highlighting the potential benefit for both of us. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving space to potentially lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still making a profit.
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer to ensure I can achieve my minimum value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I still have the option to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a compromise by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,000. 
* **Strategic Message:** I'm framing it as a ""fair price"" for both of us, again highlighting a win-win scenario.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $13,000 is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still keeping John in the back of my mind, reminding me that I have a backup option if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
