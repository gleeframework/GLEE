{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to try and get a higher price than Bob's offer.  While $18,000 is better than selling to John, I believe there's more room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $19,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $17000 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $17,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better offer. There are still several rounds left and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference - $18,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit higher than $18000. How about $16500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, I'm getting close to my floor price of $15,000.  While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it."
