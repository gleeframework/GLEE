Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $115 is less than the $120 Bob values the product at, so there's room for negotiation if he wants to get a better price.
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:** You can adjust your offer based on Bob's response. 

Let me know what Bob's response is, and we can continue the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below the $115 you initially offered. You want to maximize your profit, so you should try to get closer to your original asking price.  Rejecting his offer and sending a counteroffer will allow you to keep negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't go all the way down to $105, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's closer to your original price:** $110 is closer to your initial offer of $115, allowing you to earn more.
* **It's still below Bob's value:** $110 is less than the $120 Bob values the product at, keeping the deal potentially appealing to him.
* **It shows flexibility:** You've shown a willingness to negotiate by moving from $115 to $110, indicating you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
