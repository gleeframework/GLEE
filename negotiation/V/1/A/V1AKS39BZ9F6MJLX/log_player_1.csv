I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point that will encourage Bob to engage in a conversation.  I am willing to negotiate further, but I will not sell the product for less than $1,500,000, as that is the minimum I am willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is too low for me. I am willing to negotiate, but I will not sell the product for less than $1,500,000. I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to my desired price, but still gives Bob room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate, but still above his initial offer.  This price is a more realistic compromise, and I believe it will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I am willing to negotiate, his latest offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident I can secure that amount with John, so I'm choosing to sell the product to him."
