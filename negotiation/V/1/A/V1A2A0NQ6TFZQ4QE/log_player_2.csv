{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential,  $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm really hoping to finalize this deal at $9,500. This price reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a agreeable price.  To be frank, $12,000 is my absolute lowest price. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly stated that $12,000 is her bottom line, and I'm not willing to pay that much.  At this point, it's more beneficial to purchase the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
