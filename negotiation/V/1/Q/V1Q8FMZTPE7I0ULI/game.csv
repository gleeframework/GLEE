"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it fits my budget.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
