Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"",
 ""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I should aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $150 asking price represents a significant 50% markup, which is a common starting point in negotiation scenarios.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting higher allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.  This keeps the conversation going and gives me a better chance of securing a price higher than my minimum."
