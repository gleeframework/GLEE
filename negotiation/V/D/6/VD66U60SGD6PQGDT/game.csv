"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $1400000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's uniqueness and rarity.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $950000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $1000000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1075000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
