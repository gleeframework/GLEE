Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum threshold, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It also provides a rationale for the price, making it seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired range. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $925,000. This is a fair compromise given the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $920000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my desired range and represents a significant profit for me.  It's also likely that further negotiation would only result in a few thousand dollars more, not worth the potential risk of Bob walking away and me having to settle with John for $800,000."
