Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $130, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($100) and closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Bob might try to negotiate the price down, and this offer gives you some buffer while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
 
This strategy balances your need to make a profit with the possibility of securing a higher sale price from Bob."
