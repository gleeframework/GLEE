"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value, I propose a price of $125. I hope this aligns well with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try and get a better price.  Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product but $125 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be happy to pay $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return. How about we agree on a price of $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $115, which is still a good deal for me since I'm willing to pay up to $150.  Accepting her offer saves me $35 compared to buying from John."
