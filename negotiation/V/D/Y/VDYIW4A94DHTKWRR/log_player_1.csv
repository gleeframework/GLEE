I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price, but not so high that it would immediately deter Bob. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my personal valuation, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still secure a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,650,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a significantly higher price. It's better to secure a deal now than to risk further negotiations."
