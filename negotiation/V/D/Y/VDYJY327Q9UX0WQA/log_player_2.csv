"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is more than your maximum valuation of $12,000. You have a better alternative: buying from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $500."
