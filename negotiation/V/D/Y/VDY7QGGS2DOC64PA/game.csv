"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $95.  If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $95. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $110 and $95. How about $102.50?",102.5,Alice,5,
