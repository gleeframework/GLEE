``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get the price lower than $100."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $92.50.

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. I believe I can get a slightly better price by making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for a high-quality product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is within my budget and is a good deal compared to John's $120. While I'd prefer to pay even less, continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to buy the product at a reasonable price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this situation."
