"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can potentially get the product for even less by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows for further negotiation and a chance to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he should start with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to negotiate but still shows that he's interested in the product. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  This offer gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:**  While Bob's ideal price is $10,000, Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still within his budget. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Alice might become unwilling to budge further, potentially leading to a higher price or a breakdown in negotiations.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a stalemate or a higher price from John."
