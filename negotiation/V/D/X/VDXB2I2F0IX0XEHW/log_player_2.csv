"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're willing to start negotiations at $140. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are trying to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's initial offer of $140 is too high, given that the product is worth $150 to you.
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's still within my budget, but lower than Alice's initial offer.
* My message is polite and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* This gives Alice an opportunity to counter without completely rejecting my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I believe we can find a fair price for both of us. I'll counter with $135 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $135 is within my budget and only slightly higher than my counteroffer of $130.
* Accepting this offer saves me $15 compared to buying from John and is a good compromise.
* I don't want to risk losing the deal and ending up having to buy from John at a higher price."
