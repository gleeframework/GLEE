"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $800,000. There's potential to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly higher than Alice's initial offer but still within my budget. This shows I'm interested in the product but not willing to accept her low price. I'm hoping this will start a negotiation process where we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still a bit high. I'm hoping to get it down closer to my ideal price range. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my strategy of slowly decreasing my counteroffer, aiming to meet Alice halfway. $500,000 is a significant amount of money saved from my budget, and it might be a price Alice is willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $525,000 is within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my next offer and the possibility of reaching a stalemate increases. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price while still leaving some room for future negotiations if necessary."
