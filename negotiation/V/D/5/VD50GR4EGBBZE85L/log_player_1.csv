Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Here's why:

* **My minimum:** I won't sell for less than $12,000, as that's the value to me.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $8,000.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed backup offer of $12,000 from John.
* **Negotiation:**  Offering $11,000 gives me a chance to maximize profit while still potentially securing a sale. Bob gets a decent deal, and I'm still well above my minimum. 

If Bob rejects, I can confidently go with John's offer and ensure a sale at my desired price."
