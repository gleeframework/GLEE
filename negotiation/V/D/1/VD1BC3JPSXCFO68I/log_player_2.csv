"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you.  I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for something that can be so transformative. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, the price is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it, considering its value to me and my current financial constraints. I'm open to further discussion, but this is my initial counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counterproposal.  While I understand your position, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,300,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering our respective positions. This would be my final offer, as I'm not comfortable exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
