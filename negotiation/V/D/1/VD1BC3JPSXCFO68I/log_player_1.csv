Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, the price is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it, considering its value to me and my current financial constraints. I'm open to further discussion, but this is my initial counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counterproposal.  While I understand your position, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering our respective positions. This would be my final offer, as I'm not comfortable exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is now offering $100,000 more than my fallback option (selling to John). It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and risking further negotiation for a relatively small gain isn't worth potentially losing the deal altogether."
