I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it?,180.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
That's a bit too expensive for me. I'm interested in the product but could you do a lower price? I'm thinking closer to $60.,60.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"I can see you're interested in the product, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $140?",140.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $75? That feels like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,130.0
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $122.50?",122.5,Alice,5,,
