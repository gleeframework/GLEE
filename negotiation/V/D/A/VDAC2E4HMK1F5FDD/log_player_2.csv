"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely reject and counter-offer to bring the price down closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit too expensive for me. I'm interested in the product but could you do a lower price? I'm thinking closer to $60."", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation.  It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying well below your $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're interested in the product, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $140 is still too high. You should continue negotiating and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $75? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **Moving closer:** You're incrementally increasing your offer, showing Alice you're willing to negotiate.
* **Staying below your limit:**  You remain under your $80 maximum, ensuring you get a good deal if she accepts.
* **Fairness:**  You're framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" which might make Alice more receptive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $122.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Explanation:

Alice is stubbornly sticking to prices far above your limit. It's unlikely you'll negotiate her down to an acceptable price. Buying from John at $80 guarantees you stay within budget and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiation."
