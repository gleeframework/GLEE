{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts at a price that's more than what I need ($80) but leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to Bob's value of $120.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested but I can only pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is more than John's offer, it's still below my minimum price of $80.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe $85 is a fair price for the product. Let's try to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $87.5 is still below my ideal price, it's above my minimum and also very close to John's offer. I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely and ending up with John's lower price. It's time to accept and move on."
