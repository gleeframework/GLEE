"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $15,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I think $16,500 is still a bit high. Can we try to find a compromise at $14,500? I believe this price is more in line with my budget.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $14,500 is cutting it pretty close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to accept $15,500.  This offer takes into account our negotiations thus far and keeps the price closer to market value.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,500 is close to your bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $15,000. Can you consider this offer?",15000.0,Bob,6,
