"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. The product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $9,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
