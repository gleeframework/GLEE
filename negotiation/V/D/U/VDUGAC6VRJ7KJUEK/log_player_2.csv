"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He can counteroffer Alice and try to get a better price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can still get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no need to accept a higher price. Bob should counteroffer Alice again and try to reach a price closer to his target."
