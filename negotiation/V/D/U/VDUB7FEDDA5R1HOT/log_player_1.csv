Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider a significantly lower price, closer to $800,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, I understand your need to work within a budget.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?
