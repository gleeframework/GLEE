"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider a significantly lower price, closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, I understand your need to work within a budget.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects the true worth of the product.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
