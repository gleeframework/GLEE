"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This offer stands as a sign of my willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
