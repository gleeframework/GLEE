"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it will be a great asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a high opening offer, but it gives you room to negotiate downwards.  I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit, but also be open to negotiation.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1000000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm still holding out for more. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob.  It's worth a few more rounds to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $900,000.  It reflects the true value of the product and the potential it holds for your business.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $825000?  That's a significant step closer to my budget and leaves some room for us to come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum price of $800,000 and is only $25,000 less than what I could get from John.  It's better to take the deal now than risk losing a better offer from Bob or having to negotiate further."
