"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it will be a great asset to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try and negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the first offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $750000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $900000.  It reflects the true value of the product and the potential it holds for your business.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue negotiating. While $900,000 is closer to his desired price, there's still room to lower it further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to send a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $825,000?  That's a significant step closer to my budget and leaves some room for us to come to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 825000}
