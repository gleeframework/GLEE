"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to own a unique item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum price point of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $10,500. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within a budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $10,500. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above his maximum of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  Bob still has time left to negotiate with Alice before needing to resort to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. If you're willing to meet me halfway there, we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,000, which is $250 less than my previous offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to stay within his budget of $12,000. While Alice has come down from her initial price, $11,000 is still too high.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob more leverage to potentially get a lower price. There are still rounds remaining, and Bob can still choose to buy from John if a deal with Alice doesn't materialize."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me. However, $11,000 is still above my budget. Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to go up to $10,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I'm counteroffering at $11,250 is too high for me, but I can do $11,000 was too low, I can meet you halfway from $10,875. I'm counteroffering at $11,062.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,062.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,062.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and Alice's counteroffers are still higher than Bob's desired price point. There are only a few rounds left, and the chances of getting a lower price from Alice seem slim.  It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Alice, as Bob might run out of time and be forced to accept a higher price or go without the product. 

Buying from John at $12,000 is a safe and guaranteed option. While it's not the ideal price, it's within Bob's budget, and it ensures he gets the product.  It's better to secure the product now than risk getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation that might not yield a favorable outcome."
