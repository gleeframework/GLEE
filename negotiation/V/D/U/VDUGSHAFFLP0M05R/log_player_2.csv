"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,150,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm confident we can find a compromise. How about we settle on $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $1,100,000**. This is closer to Bob's desired price of $1,050,000.
* **Buying from John would cost $1,200,000**. Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **There's a risk in continuing to negotiate**. Alice may not budge further, and Bob might end up paying more than $1,100,000 or even lose the deal entirely.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision at this point, ensuring Bob gets a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
