Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd find it highly beneficial. I'm offering it to you for $1,190,000. This is a special offer just for you, reflecting my belief in its potential for your needs."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($1,190,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob:
    * It's a significant discount from your perspective, showing flexibility.
    * It's still a substantial profit for you if he accepts. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message highlights the product's value specifically for Bob and frames the price as a special, time-limited offer to encourage him to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you are comfortable potentially losing the deal with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* There's always a risk Bob might try to negotiate further. Be prepared with a clear bottom line in mind."
