"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll get from owning this product, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $900,000 is less than $1,200,000.
* **You are still getting a good deal:** You value the product at $1,200,000 and are getting it for $900,000. This represents a significant savings."
