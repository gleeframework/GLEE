"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $2,200,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong anchor price significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while conveying the product's worth. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly influencing Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room:**  The high initial price gives us space to gradually lower the price during negotiations, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a more reasonable price point. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and your initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. There's room to explore if we can reach a price closer to your target.  We'll aim to negotiate upwards in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,900,000. This reflects the immense value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging & Bridging:** We start by acknowledging Bob's offer and desire for a ""reasonable"" price, showing we're listening. 
* **Firm but Fair:** While we significantly decrease from our initial offer, we remain firm above Bob's valuation and well above your minimum.
* **Value Focus:** We re-emphasize the product's inherent value to justify the high price.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Move closer to a deal:**  We've made a substantial step down, showing willingness to compromise.
2. **Test Bob's limits:** We'll see how Bob reacts to this counteroffer, which will give us a better understanding of his negotiation style and potential to meet your needs. 
3. **Avoid a stalemate:**  By making a significant move, we aim to keep the negotiation momentum going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,900,000 is just not feasible for me. I'm serious about purchasing it, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Could you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer slightly, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and it's important to signal that you're serious about a price that reflects the product's value. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob to make a more substantial move while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're looking for a fair deal.  Let's be honest, $700,000 is nowhere near the value this product delivers. I'm willing to make this work, so here's my final offer: $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** We're now getting close to a make-or-break point in the negotiation. The message is direct about the inadequacy of Bob's offer but maintains a collaborative tone.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and importance. Bob needs to know we're serious about our bottom line.
* **Strategic Compromise:** The price is a significant drop from our previous offer, making it appear like a major concession and increasing the perceived value for Bob. 
* **Above Minimum:**  Crucially, we're still above your absolute minimum, providing a small buffer should Bob attempt a final counter.

This approach aims to either secure a deal at a price acceptable to you or prompt Bob to reveal his true willingness to pay a premium for the product. We're at a stage where continued lowball offers from Bob might make selling to John the more favorable option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but to be frank, $1,600,000 is completely outside the realm of possibility for me.  I've been upfront about my budget, and to move forward, we need to see a significant adjustment in price.  I'm willing to offer $750,000. If that's not workable, I need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000, while a slight increase, remains far below your minimum acceptable price. More importantly, his language suggests he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He's been consistently lowballing, and you've made substantial concessions.  

Continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, meeting your minimum. 

It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale to John."
