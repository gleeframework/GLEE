"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $2,200,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a more reasonable price point. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,900,000. This reflects the immense value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,900,000 is just not feasible for me. I'm serious about purchasing it, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Could you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're looking for a fair deal.  Let's be honest, $700,000 is nowhere near the value this product delivers. I'm willing to make this work, so here's my final offer: $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but to be frank, $1,600,000 is completely outside the realm of possibility for me.  I've been upfront about my budget, and to move forward, we need to see a significant adjustment in price.  I'm willing to offer $750,000. If that's not workable, I need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
