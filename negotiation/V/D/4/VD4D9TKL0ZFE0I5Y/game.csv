"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere.  While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be open to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're really close! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and do $12,000 even? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
