"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
