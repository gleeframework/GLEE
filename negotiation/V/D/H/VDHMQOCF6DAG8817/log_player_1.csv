Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value makes it a good deal for him while still netting you a significant gain.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why this Offer?**

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is $50,000 less than what he values the product at, making it a compelling offer.
* **Profitable for You:** You secure a profit of $150,000, significantly more than your minimum.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a fluid process. Bob might counter-offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but always keep your minimum price in mind."
