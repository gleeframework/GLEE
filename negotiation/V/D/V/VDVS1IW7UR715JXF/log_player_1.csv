Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It's a strong opening offer that shows confidence in the value of your product while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it is still significantly lower than the value of the product to him.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I am willing to negotiate but still believe the product is worth more than $1,350,000. This is a good tactic to keep the negotiations moving forward."
