"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You know the product is worth less than $1,450,000 to Alice, so there's potential to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle ground:** It's also a reasonable starting point, considering the product's value to Alice is $1,200,000. 
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counteroffer without going below her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to your ideal price:** Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, and the price is now within a reasonable range.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal. 
* **John's offer:**  Accepting this offer is still a better deal than purchasing from John. 

This decision balances the desire to get the lowest possible price with the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
