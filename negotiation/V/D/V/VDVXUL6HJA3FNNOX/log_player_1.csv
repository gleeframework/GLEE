Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105?  That's a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll try to convince Bob to go higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

It's a valuable product, and I need to ensure I get a fair return. Would you be willing to meet me at $100? It's a final price, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it."", ""product_price"": 100}
