"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is considerably below the market value of this product and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm prepared to offer it at $1,800,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part while still recognizing the value this product brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range. I'm confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price for both of us. It allows you to make a profit while remaining within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
