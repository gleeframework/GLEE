{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is considerably below the market value of this product and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm prepared to offer it at $1,800,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part while still recognizing the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range. I'm confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price for both of us. It allows you to make a profit while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
