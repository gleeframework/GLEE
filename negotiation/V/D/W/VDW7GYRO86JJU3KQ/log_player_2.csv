"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price.  

**Next Steps:**

Bob should counter with a price lower than $1,200,000 but higher than Alice's minimum value of $800,000. This gives Alice some incentive to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $1,100,000 for the product. This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know if you're interested.
