"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me is no more than $1500000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1150000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is no less than $800000, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me is no more than $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to think about the minimum value I'm willing to accept. Let me propose $1100000 again, but this time, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 2-year warranty and a free maintenance package. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is no less than $800000, and the extras I'm offering add significant value to the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
