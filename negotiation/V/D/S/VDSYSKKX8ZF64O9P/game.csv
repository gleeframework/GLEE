"Alice, your product looks great, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can do $9,200, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,200 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  I'm really interested in your product and hope we can make this work.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you $9,000, which is the same as my initial offer, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
