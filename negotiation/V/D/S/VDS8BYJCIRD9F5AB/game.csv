"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a fair price for this product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12000 is a good starting point, I need to recover my costs and make a profit. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground!",13500.0,Alice,3,
