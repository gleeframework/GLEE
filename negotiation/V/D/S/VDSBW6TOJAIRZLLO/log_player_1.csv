Unfortunately, we've reached the final round, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go lower than $1,300,000. I have to secure a good return on my investment. 

Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than losing money on the deal."
