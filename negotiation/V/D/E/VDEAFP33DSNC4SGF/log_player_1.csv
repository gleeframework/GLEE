"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This price is well above the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if he's willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a substantial profit.  I believe this price is reasonable, considering Bob's value for the product, and it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still a profitable deal for me, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering Bob's value for the product.  I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  Bob is getting closer, but I'm running out of time. It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
