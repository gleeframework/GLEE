"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $15,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",15750.0,Alice,5,
