"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor.  This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high final price.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is framed positively but doesn't reveal too much about your bottom line. It invites Bob to engage in the negotiation, allowing you to assess his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer. This knowledge empowers you to be firmer in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your initial ask. You have room to negotiate, and you know John provides a safety net at $1,500,000. Rejecting this offer signals that you're aiming higher and keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  It seems we both see the inherent value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're making a significant concession from your initial price but still keeping it above both your minimum and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while reinforcing the product's value.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""middle ground"" and ""true worth"" attempts to anchor the price psychologically at this new point. 
* **Pressure:** While you haven't revealed your alternative with John, the firm but fair tone implies you're willing to walk away if necessary. This can subtly encourage Bob to move closer to your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still below your guaranteed sale price with John. You're getting closer, and it's worth seeing if you can push Bob a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,850,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and importance. 
* **Strategic Position:** This price is a strong compromise - significantly above your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000) but still below your initial offers. 
* **Pressure:** By presenting this as your last offer, you shift the decision pressure to Bob. He now needs to decide if accepting a price slightly above his last offer is worth the risk of losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  While not your ideal price, $1,700,000 is still a significant profit over your guaranteed sale with John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns.  Bob might not go much higher, and you risk him walking away entirely, leaving you with the $1,500,000 from John. It's better to secure a good deal now.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now saves you time and potential hassle with further negotiation rounds."
