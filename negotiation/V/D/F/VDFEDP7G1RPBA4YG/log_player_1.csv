``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from the product's worth to Bob, but also leaves room for negotiation if he wants to haggle. It's also above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, so I'm happy to accept if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but I believe I can still get more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
