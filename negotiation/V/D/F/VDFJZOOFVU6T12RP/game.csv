"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8250. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $7800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $7800. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8100. This is as close as I can get to your target price without sacrificing my own profit margin.
