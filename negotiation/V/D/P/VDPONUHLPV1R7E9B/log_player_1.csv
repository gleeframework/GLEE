"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe this price reflects both our interests. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so selling to John is not a good option. While Bob's offer is lower than my initial asking price, I can still make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price. It's too early to accept his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,100,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I can still make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal. It's too early to accept his offer, and I still have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about the budget. How about we meet at $1,200,000? It's a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while making the product more accessible for you. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I could do $1,180,000 to finalize the deal.  That's a very strong offer and shows how serious I am about purchasing this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept. We have a few more rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I want to maximize my profit, and selling to John is not an option as it's below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position and appreciate your persistence.  $1,180,000 is very close, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about $1,190,000?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it gives me the chance to secure a more favorable deal. Let's find a common ground and get this done."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
