"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what you're willing to pay, but still a bit higher than your last offer. How about $12,200? It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",12200.0,Alice,5,
