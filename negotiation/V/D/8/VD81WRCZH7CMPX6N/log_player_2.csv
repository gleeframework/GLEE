Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what you're willing to pay, but still a bit higher than your last offer. How about $12,200? It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,000.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John for $12,000 and avoid the risk of Alice increasing her price or reaching a stalemate."
