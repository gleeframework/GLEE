"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item has been meticulously crafted to meet the highest standards of quality and functionality. Given its unique value proposition, we believe it would be an excellent addition to your collection or business. We are offering this remarkable product to you at a special price of $1,200,000. We are confident that this price reflects both the product's intrinsic worth and our commitment to providing exceptional value to our esteemed clients. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth negotiating further to try and get a better price.  You can potentially get the product for less than $1,200,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your description of the product.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, we would like to extend a revised offer. We believe that a mutually beneficial price for both parties would be $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for us. We hope this proposal aligns better with your current budget and looks forward to your positive response.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is within your budget and is closer to your initial counteroffer of $1,050,000.  It's a good deal, saving you $400,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation could potentially lower the price, but the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially increasing the price is too high."
