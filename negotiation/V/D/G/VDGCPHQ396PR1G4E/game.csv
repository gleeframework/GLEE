"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,100,000 simply isn't enough for me to let go of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price given its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000, which is closer to my maximum.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is truly my minimum. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I'm offering it to you at that price. It's a fair deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
