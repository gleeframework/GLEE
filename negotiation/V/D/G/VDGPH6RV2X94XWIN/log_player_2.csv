You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $90, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer $95. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $95 secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the price going up or having to settle for John's $120 offer."
