"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product.  This gives us room to negotiate and still get a good price, while also not scaring him off completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on his last offer, but still maintain a price that's more advantageous for me.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer.  I'm confident that this is a fair price that still leaves me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up yet.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and increase the chance of Bob accepting.  I'm confident this is still a good price for me and will hopefully seal the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I'm running out of time.  It's getting increasingly unlikely that we'll reach a deal that is mutually agreeable.   Given the risk of losing too much time and potentially failing to sell to either Bob or John, I'll take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
