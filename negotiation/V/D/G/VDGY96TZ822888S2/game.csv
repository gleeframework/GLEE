"Hi Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be a bit too high for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $180 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $100. That seems fair considering my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again, at $140? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm still sticking to my limit of $80. This is a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with another option.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. How about $160? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product",160.0,Alice,7,
