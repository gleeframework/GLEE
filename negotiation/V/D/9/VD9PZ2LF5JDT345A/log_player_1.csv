Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $170. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $170 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Setting a positive tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By not immediately going for the absolute highest price, it opens the door for a potential counteroffer from Bob, giving me a chance to get closer to my desired price point. 
* **Having a backup plan:** Knowing I can sell to John for $150 ensures I won't be forced to accept a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is still a good option:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $150, which is more than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:**  $120 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message highlights the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for compromise:**  Leaving room for further negotiation (by not offering the absolute minimum) could lead to a quicker agreement. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  Keeping the communication friendly helps build rapport and increases the chance of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $75? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $75 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $75 given his budget constraints. Further negotiation might be unproductive and time-consuming.
* **Selling to John is the best option:** Given that John is willing to pay $150, it's the most advantageous option for me. This ensures I meet my minimum price requirement and avoids further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
