"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of this product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $14,500 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love it.",14500.0,Alice,5,
