"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, $200 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's try $140.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $160. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",160.0,Alice,5,
