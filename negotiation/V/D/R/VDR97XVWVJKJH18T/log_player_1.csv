Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $9500. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a lower budget. Would it be possible for you to consider a price closer to $8000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
