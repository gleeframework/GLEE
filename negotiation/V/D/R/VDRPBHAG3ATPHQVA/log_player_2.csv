You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $65 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $77? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $75? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go lower. Accepting $75 gets the product below your $80 maximum and saves you money compared to buying from John."
