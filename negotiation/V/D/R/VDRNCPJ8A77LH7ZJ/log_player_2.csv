"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.** This is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.
* **However, your goal is to save as much money as possible.** You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a lower price.** You can either counteroffer Alice or see if John will lower his price."
