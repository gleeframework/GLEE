Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $13,000 is just a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter your offer with $13200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,200 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle yet. We've both moved a little, and there's room for more negotiation. I'm going to stick to my strategy of pushing for a higher price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my goal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $13,400? It's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I would like to counter your offer with $13300 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last 4 rounds, and I'm getting closer to my desired price. While I'd love to push for $13,400, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely, leaving me with only the $12,000 offer from John. It's better to take the $13,300 now and secure the deal."
