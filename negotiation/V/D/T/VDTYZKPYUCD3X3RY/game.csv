"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price would still allow you to make a good profit on the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,250. Can you consider this offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
