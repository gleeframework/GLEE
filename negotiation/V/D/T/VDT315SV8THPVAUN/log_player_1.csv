"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room for negotiation and also sends a signal that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000, especially since I have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This price would be a good compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer to a deal, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away with a win. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 940000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $930,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting very close to my target price, and with only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating.  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee that will happen. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
