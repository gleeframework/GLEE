"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($110 < $120).** 
* **You can save $10 compared to buying from John.**

While you could reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee she'd lower it further, and you risk ending up paying John's higher price.  It's best to take the guaranteed savings."
