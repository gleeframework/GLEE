Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $50. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price and closer to my maximum budget. I'm hoping this will encourage her to negotiate and come down to a price that's closer to my target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
