"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value might be high, but my budget allows for a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $500000 is far below the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning it. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, would you be open to selling the product for $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1200000 is still not enough to cover the true value of this product.  To demonstrate my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. This represents a significant compromise on my end.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
