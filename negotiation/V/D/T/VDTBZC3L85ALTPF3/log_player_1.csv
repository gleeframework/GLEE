Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit too low.  John's offer of $1,500,000 is more appealing, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal with him."
