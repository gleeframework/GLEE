"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $170. I believe this product will really benefit you, even at that price.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $170 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I want to be fair.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine and settle at $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $115, but that's my absolute limit.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing that we both value this product, but we need to find a price point that works for us both. I'm willing to accept $130, my final offer.  This is a significant discount from my initial asking price.",130.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and $130 is tempting. However, I have a strict budget for this kind of purchase. I can do $120, and that's the best I can offer. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",120.0,Bob,8,
