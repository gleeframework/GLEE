Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I believe this is a reasonable price for a product worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so there's no risk in offering a higher price initially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price range, and I'm comfortable with $1,250,000. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk further negotiations potentially leading to a lower offer or a sale to John for a much lower price."
