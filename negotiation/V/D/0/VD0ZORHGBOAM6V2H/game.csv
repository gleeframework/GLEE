"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $135? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get a quick sale.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $135. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about we meet at $132.50? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",132.5,Alice,5,
