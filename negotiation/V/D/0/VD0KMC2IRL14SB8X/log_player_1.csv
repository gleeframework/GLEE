Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now offering the same amount as John. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting his offer guarantees the sale at my minimum acceptable price."
