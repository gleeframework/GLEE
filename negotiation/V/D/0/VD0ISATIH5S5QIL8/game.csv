"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you $10,250 for the product. This seems like a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a slightly better compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $10,750, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",10750.0,Alice,7,
