Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $15,500 is the best price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Bob seems quite set on a price around $14,000.  Accepting now secures a $2,000 profit over selling to John.  Continuing the negotiation risks Bob lowering his offer further, or reaching a stalemate where selling to John becomes the only viable option."
