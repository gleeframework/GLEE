"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1500000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

I'm willing to come down to $1400000, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'm prepared to move forward with another buyer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
