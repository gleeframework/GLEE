"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there yet. How about $16000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17500 and $16000. How about we try $16750? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",16750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but I still think $16750 is a little high. How about $16500?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price.",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle between $16750 and $16500? That would be $16625. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product.",16625.0,Alice,7,
