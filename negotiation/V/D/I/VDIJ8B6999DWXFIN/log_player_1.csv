"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and leaves some potential for a win-win scenario. 

I'm assuming Bob is a savvy buyer, so it's likely he'll counteroffer. By setting a high initial price, I set the stage for a negotiation that allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not going to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant increase from his initial offer, and it's getting closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept it and close the deal with Bob."
