"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,325,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me and my budget. I hope you'll consider it.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,325,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
