"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal budget.  Bob can likely negotiate a lower price, as he's already shown he's willing to walk away.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,325,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me and my budget. I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,325,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already rejected Bob's offer of $1,300,000, and her latest offer of $1,325,000 is still above Bob's ideal budget.  Since there are only 5 rounds left, the chances of successfully negotiating a lower price are slim.  Furthermore, Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer.  Therefore, Bob should choose to buy the product from John to save money and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
