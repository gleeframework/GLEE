"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $180? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",180.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $250 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $180. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $220. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,3,
