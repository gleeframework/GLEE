"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $107.50?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that.  However,  $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $112.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be willing to finalize the sale.",112.5,Alice,5,
