"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. $100 is still too high for him, as he values the product at $120. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is a significant reduction from Alice's original price, but still within a reasonable range.  He wants to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob still wants to save as much money as possible, and $105 is still too high for him.  He's willing to continue negotiating, as he believes he can get a better deal.  It's unlikely he'll buy from John yet, as he's still trying to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'll pay $97.50. It's a fair price, and it gets us both closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a counteroffer that's a small compromise from his previous offer, but still saves him money. He's trying to show Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's also not willing to pay an unreasonable price. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward while keeping him close to his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate the effort. However, I'm still not willing to go below $102. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $102 is still a bit more than Bob would like to pay, it's now only $2 more than his target price of $100.  He has a few rounds left to negotiate, but he's not likely to get a much lower price.  Accepting the offer saves him time and ensures he doesn't risk losing the product entirely to another buyer (like John)."
