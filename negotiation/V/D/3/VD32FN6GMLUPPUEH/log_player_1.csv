Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 14999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, as that's her guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a ""very competitive price"" and positioning it as an ""opportunity,"" Alice aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a deal he shouldn't miss.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting high leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above the $15,000 mark. 

**It's important to note:**  This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's true valuation of the product at $8,000."
