"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks great, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm confident we can still negotiate a higher price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $900,000 right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $875,000? That's a good middle ground, and we can both walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is close enough to my minimum threshold of $800,000, and it's more than what John is offering. I'll accept Bob's offer to ensure a sale."
