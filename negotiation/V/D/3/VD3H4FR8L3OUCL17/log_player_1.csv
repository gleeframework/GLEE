"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $12,000. This leaves a decent amount of room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding my minimum acceptable price.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, this offer is likely to be appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than what he's willing to pay, and it's closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is slightly higher than what John is offering, and it meets my minimum acceptable price.  I'll accept Bob's offer to maximize my profit."
