"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
