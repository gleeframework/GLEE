Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $11,500?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,000 is still a stretch for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.

You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go above $12,000. Accepting that offer means losing out on a potential $3,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
