"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This initial offer is a strong starting point.  It's below your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a significant discount from your true value, making it attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I still feel that $975,000 is a bit steep. I would like to counter with an offer of $960,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $960,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $975,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $960,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $965,000.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 965000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I would like to counter with an offer of $962,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $965,000, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting $962,500 is a good deal, especially considering John is offering $1,200,000. I don't want to risk losing out on a sale entirely."
