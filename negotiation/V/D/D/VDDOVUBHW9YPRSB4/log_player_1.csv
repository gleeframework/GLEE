"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. $20,000 is a significant premium over my minimum, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point.  I'll be closely watching Bob's response to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $18,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to secure a good price.  If Bob is serious about buying, he should be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $17,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I believe I can push for a bit more. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway again. $18,500 is a reasonable compromise, and I think it's likely Bob will accept at this point.  If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid losing too much time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

This is getting dicey. While $16,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm worried he might continue to drop the price. I'm going to counter one last time. If that fails, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm taking a risk here, but I'm going to counter with $17,000.  This is my final offer. If Bob rejects it, I'm going to sell to John to avoid losing more time and potential profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting frustrating. Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm running out of time. While $16,000 is not a terrible price, I don't want to risk further negotiation and possibly ending up with less than John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
