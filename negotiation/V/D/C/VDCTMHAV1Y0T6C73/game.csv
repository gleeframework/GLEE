"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,200, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for this product.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  $7,200 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for. To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value our interaction, so I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the value you'll be receiving.",8000.0,Alice,5,
