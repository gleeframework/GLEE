"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This should leave room for negotiation while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is a decent profit, I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer, and still leaving me a solid profit."
