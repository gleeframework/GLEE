"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $112.50. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $107.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $112. I've already compromised a bit by meeting you halfway earlier. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but $112 is my minimum. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm open to discussing further.",112.0,Alice,5,
