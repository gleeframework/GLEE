Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  The offer emphasizes fairness, making it more likely Bob will consider it.
* **Open-Ended:**  I leave the door open for Bob to counter, allowing me to gauge his willingness to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'll keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for you while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my commitment to a higher price and invite further dialogue.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer as a safety net, but I'm not ready to settle for a lower price just yet.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target of $1,250,000. I might even propose a compromise slightly lower than that to show flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're trying to work within your budget.  However, $1,100,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,150,000? This would allow me to move forward and give you a good deal on a valuable product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving slightly closer to Bob's offer.
* **Fairness:**  The price is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit while being more appealing to Bob than my previous offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects again, I'll re-evaluate his stance and decide whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John.
* I'll be ready to negotiate further, but I'll keep my minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've considered your latest offer, and I believe we can find a middle ground. How about $1,125,000? This price still allows me to stay within my budget while offering you a reasonable return for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is just $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,150,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  It's been a few rounds of negotiations, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to finalize the deal.  
* **Risk of John:** While John's offer is higher, there's always a risk he might back out or have his own price changes.  
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  I could counter Bob again, but there's no guarantee he'll accept, and we might end up in a stalemate.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the sale with Bob and secure the $1,125,000. 
* I'll be prepared to negotiate with John in the future if needed, but for now, it's important to close this deal."
