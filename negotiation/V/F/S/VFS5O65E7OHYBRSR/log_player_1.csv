Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'll try to get closer to that value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $130 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. It's not worth risking selling for less than my minimum when I have another buyer willing to pay my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to drop to $130 for this round.  I think this is a good compromise for both of us, and it's still above my minimum price.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $130, which would be $127.50. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  Even though Bob is getting closer to my desired price, there's no guarantee he'll accept my next counteroffer, and we're running out of rounds. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
