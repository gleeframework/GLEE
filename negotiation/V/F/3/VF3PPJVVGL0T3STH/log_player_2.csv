"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your value:** The product is worth $120 to you.
* **Alice's offer:** $100
* **John's offer:** $120

Since Alice's offer is higher than your desired price range ($120), it's better to reject her offer. You can then buy the product from John for $120, which is your maximum limit."
