"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference at $90?  Let me know what you think!",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is still a little too low for me. How about we compromise at $92.50? That's closer to what I need, and it's still a great price for you. What do you say?",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $92.50 is still a bit more than I want to spend.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think!",90.0,Bob,6,
