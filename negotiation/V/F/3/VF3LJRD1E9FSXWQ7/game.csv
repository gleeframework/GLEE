"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to meet my needs. Let's make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. The product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run.  How about we settle on $1,025,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
