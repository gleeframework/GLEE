"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($60 vs. $100), we aim to create room for negotiation and potentially secure a much better deal. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message remains courteous and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating budget limitations. This approach fosters a more collaborative negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer leaves us space to gradually increase our bid if needed while still staying well below our maximum budget of $80 and John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your upper limit. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go any lower. Accepting this offer secures the product at the best possible price without risking losing it to John's offer."
