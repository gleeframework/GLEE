"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,750,000. Considering the value of the product to me is $1,000,000, I would like to propose a price closer to that amount. How about we aim for $1,250,000? I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  Considering the product's value to you and our shared interest in closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, I still feel there might be room for further discussion. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I hope this suggestion is more aligned with your expectations and helps us reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
