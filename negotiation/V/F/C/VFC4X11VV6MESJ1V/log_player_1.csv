Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's closer to my minimum value than Bob's perceived value, giving me more negotiating room. 
* **Positive Framing:** I highlight the value Bob will get by emphasizing the product's worth exceeding his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message invites a counteroffer and keeps the conversation open.

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'm prepared to adjust the price based on Bob's response and the potential of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay $10,000. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.** While it's tempting to accept $8,500, it's still below my $12,000 minimum. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I have room to negotiate upwards, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** If I can push Bob further, or even if he rejects my counteroffer, I can still sell to John for $12,000. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows I'm open to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the value Bob will get by emphasizing the product's worth and using phrases like ""good deal"" to encourage acceptance. 

**Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider accepting his previous offer to avoid losing the sale completely. But I'll try to get closer to my minimum value first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $9,000 is very close to my minimum value of $12,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my goal, accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.
* **Risk of Losing Sale:**  There's a chance that Bob might reject a counteroffer, and I might lose the sale entirely. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting this offer guarantees a profit, which is better than the risk of negotiating further and potentially ending up with nothing. 

It's a good idea to lock in a profit, especially when the negotiation is close to my minimum acceptable price."
