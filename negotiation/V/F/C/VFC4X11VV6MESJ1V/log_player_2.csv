"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better deal than John's $8,000, you can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's room for both of you to find a middle ground. Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay $10,000. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but there's still room for negotiation.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and while $9,500 is better than her original offer, it's still above your ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $8,000."
