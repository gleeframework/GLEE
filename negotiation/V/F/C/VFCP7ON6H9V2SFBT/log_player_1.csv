"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, I can likely squeeze a bit more out of Bob before turning to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider going back to your original offer and meeting me halfway at $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm running out of time, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if Bob will budge.  If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not able to go lower than $1,125,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. I'm not willing to go any lower at this point, but I'm open to finalizing the deal at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000, which would be $1,112,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,112,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $1,125,000. I have two more rounds, so I'm going to make one more counteroffer and see if I can convince Bob to agree. If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we can both agree on.  However, I'm still firm on my offer of $1,125,000.  This price represents a fair value for the product and gives us both a good deal. If you're willing to accept this, we can close the deal now. Otherwise, I'll be forced to consider other offers.
