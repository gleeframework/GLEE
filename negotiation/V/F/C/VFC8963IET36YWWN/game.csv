"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
