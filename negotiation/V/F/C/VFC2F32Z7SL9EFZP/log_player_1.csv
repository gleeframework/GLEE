Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I'm confident you'll find this to be a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay. Since the product is only worth $80 to him, we need to start high.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small margin for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested. This keeps the conversation going.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed a good price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and how much you know about Bob, you might choose a different starting price."
