"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a significant discount from my initial price, and still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
