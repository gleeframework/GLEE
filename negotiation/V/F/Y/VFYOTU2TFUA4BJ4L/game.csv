"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's actual value and what we both know it's worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment you'll see.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can do $1,100,000. This offer reflects a fair price while acknowledging the product's worth.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your position, but your current offer doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and presents a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your decision.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this has been a helpful negotiation, but we're still too far apart. I can offer $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.  I need to move forward with the purchase soon. ",1200000.0,Bob,6,
