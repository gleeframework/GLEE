"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with an ambitious but not entirely unreasonable offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits,"" we aim to justify the high initial price, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The initial offer allows ample room for negotiation over the next 10 rounds. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 provides a strong fallback position, allowing us to be firmer in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and his own. Rejecting this offer is crucial to signal that you're serious about the product's value and not willing to settle for a low price. We still have time and the John option to leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's actual value and what we both know it's worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  Start by acknowledging Bob's response and willingness to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  While making a significant price reduction from the initial offer, we are still anchoring the price well above both Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Focusing on Value:** Emphasize the potential ROI to justify the higher price point and shift Bob's focus away from just the initial cost.
* **Strategic Concession:**  This counteroffer shows we're willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of devaluing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can do $1,100,000. This offer reflects a fair price while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob has only increased his offer by $100,000 over two rounds. At this rate, reaching an acceptable price will be difficult.
* **Below Valuation:** The offer is still significantly below both your minimum and Bob's perceived value of the product. 
* **Leverage:**  We still have John as a guaranteed buyer and time to negotiate.

It's time to signal that Bob needs to significantly improve his offer if he's serious about purchasing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but your current offer doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and presents a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** The message explicitly states this is a ""final offer,"" increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Slight Margin:** The price is set just above the guaranteed offer from John, showing a willingness to work with Bob but also setting a clear bottom line.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to emphasize the ""value"" and ""opportunity,"" subtly reminding Bob of what he might miss.
* **Time Constraint (Implied):** By presenting a final offer with five rounds remaining, we subtly introduce a time constraint, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to either secure a deal with a small margin above John's offer or prompt Bob to significantly improve his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this has been a helpful negotiation, but we're still too far apart. I can offer $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.  I need to move forward with the purchase soon.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has reached his maximum perceived value ($1,200,000) and has declared it his final offer.  
* **Unlikely Improvement:**  It's highly unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer in subsequent rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees a $1,500,000 sale, exceeding Bob's ""final offer.""

While we could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of him walking away and the minimal potential upside don't outweigh the guaranteed profit from John."
