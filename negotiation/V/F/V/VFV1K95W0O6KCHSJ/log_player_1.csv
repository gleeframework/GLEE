Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal value ($1,000,000) than my minimum ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Being Fair:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to Bob, acknowledging his potential gain. This helps build goodwill and may encourage him to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, but starting with a high price gives me a strong negotiating position. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the initial offer. Based on Bob's response, I'll need to adjust my strategy to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your consideration of my interest in the product. However, I believe we can reach a more equitable price. Based on my assessment of the product's value to me, I would like to propose a purchase price of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and the true value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $850,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value of $800,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob. He's already shown interest and is willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain a strong position and signal that I'm not desperate to sell. This will likely push Bob to come back with a higher offer.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $900,000. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the significant value this product holds for you while remaining fair for me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my position.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the high value the product holds for Bob, making it clear that I'm considering his perspective. 
* **Seeking Compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a search for a solution that benefits both of us, promoting a collaborative approach.

**Strategy:** 

By staying firm on my minimum price and offering a compromise, I'm aiming to nudge Bob closer to my desired price point.  I'm also keeping the door open for further negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. Based on my assessment and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a purchase price of $875,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum desired value of $800,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I would prefer a higher price, I'm not sure I can get significantly more from Bob at this point.  He's already shown he's willing to negotiate but is firm on his position.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk him walking away completely.  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a worse outcome. 

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a sale at a price that's only slightly below my minimum.  This minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether and guarantees a profit."
