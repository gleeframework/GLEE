"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's try $16,000. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to make sure I get a fair value for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're willing to go up to $14,000, but I'm still a little hesitant.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  That would allow me to fairly value the product while still giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While we're getting closer, I'm not comfortable going higher, especially with only 5 rounds left.  I'm confident that buying from John for $10,000 is the best option to ensure I get the product within my budget."
