"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. I have 9 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's try $16,000. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to make sure I get a fair value for this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000, which is still above my minimum value of $15,000 but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm also emphasizing the need for a ""fair value"" to encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I have several rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a little bit closer to my desired price without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to go up to $14,000, but I'm still a little hesitant.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  That would allow me to fairly value the product while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm proposing a price of $15,000, which is my minimum value and right in the middle of our current offers. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept it."
