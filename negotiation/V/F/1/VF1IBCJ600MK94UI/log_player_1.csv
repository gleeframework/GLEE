Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial offer is above Bob's perceived value ($80), but this is intentional. It gives you space to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above your minimum. 
* **Awareness of John:**  You have a backup offer from John for $100. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to your minimum, you know you have a guaranteed $100 from John.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate Bob a bit closer to your desired price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $110. This product is really worth it, and I'm confident you'd get a lot of value from it."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  You're moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Bob's Value:** The $110 price is still a significant markup from Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for further compromise if needed.
* **John as Leverage:**  You're implicitly using John's offer as leverage. You're not dropping your price drastically because you have a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet at $110. My maximum budget remains at $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firm at $90. While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll move significantly higher. Accepting his offer means a $10 loss compared to John's offer.  It's strategically better to cut your losses and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
