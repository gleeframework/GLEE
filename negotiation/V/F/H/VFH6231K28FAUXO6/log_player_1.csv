"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also taking into account that Bob values the product at $80, so there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and hopefully a sweet spot for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my goal of $100. It's worth exploring more rounds of negotiation before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum acceptable price of $100. This is a good compromise since it's closer to Bob's last offer and it's what I'm willing to settle for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $95, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'd love to get $100, it's getting late in the negotiation, and there's a risk that Bob will walk away or I might have to sell to John for $100. I'm going to accept this offer and secure the sale."
