"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to achieve a fair price.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $12,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise that respects both our needs.",12500.0,Bob,4,
