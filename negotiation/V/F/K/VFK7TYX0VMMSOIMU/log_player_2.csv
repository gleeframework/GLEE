"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I agree that this product has value, however, I need the price to be significantly lower for it to make sense for me.  I propose $650,000."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $650,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value that I believe you're undervaluing. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $925,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $925,000 is still too high for my budget. Let's find a middle ground - how about $750,000? This demonstrates my seriousness while acknowledging the product's worth."",
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about reaching a deal, and I respect that.  While $750,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal quickly.  My final offer is $850,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly motivated to sell and has come down significantly. However, she's still above our ideal price from John. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're firm but open to a deal slightly closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $775,000. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within a strict budget on this acquisition."",
 ""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're signaling this is our final offer, adding a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counter-offer splits the difference between her last offer ($850,000) and our previous one ($750,000). 
* **Alternative Option:** By remaining below $800,000, we retain the fallback option of buying from John if Alice rejects this."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to be firm on my end.  $812,500 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is a fair deal considering the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to meet our budget. While $812,500 is close to our $800,000 limit, we've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result. Accepting defeat now and going with John ensures we get the product at the best possible price."
