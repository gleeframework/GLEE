,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $13,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about $11,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $15,000.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $12,500. This is a final offer from me, and it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and my budget of $15,000, which would be $13,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13750.0,Bob,6,
