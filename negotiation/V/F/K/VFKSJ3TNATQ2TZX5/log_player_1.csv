Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $12,000 offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $1,000), while still securing a significant profit for you (earning $2,000 over your minimum). 

This approach aims for a win-win situation while prioritizing your profit maximization."
