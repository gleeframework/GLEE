"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from Alice, and even if he fails, he can still buy it from John for his maximum price. Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $7,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $9,000. This offer is still above Alice's valuation of $8,000, so there is room for potential agreement. This strategy aims to get the best possible price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although Alice has increased her price to $9,500, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can still try to negotiate a better price or buy from John for his maximum price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500. This is a compromise from his previous offer of $7,500 and is closer to Alice's price of $9,500. It's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential agreement. By offering a slightly higher price, Bob shows his willingness to negotiate while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's price has now increased to $10,500, which is getting closer to Bob's maximum price of $12,000. There's a risk of continued back-and-forth with Alice, potentially ending with a price even higher than $12,000. It's now more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John at $12,000, ensuring a definitive purchase within his budget. This minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Alice and potential price increases."
