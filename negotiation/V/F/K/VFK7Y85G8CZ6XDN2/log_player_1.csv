Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($800,000) as possible without going below my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a limited-time offer, I hope to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid negotiation. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject this offer. However, having a backup buyer (John) ensures I can still sell the product at my desired price."
