"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my initial asking price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure I can justify the cost at $950,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel confident that the product is a good fit for my business.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and see you're serious about this. $750,000 is too low, but I'm willing to accept a final offer of $800,000. This is my absolute bottom line, as I already have another buyer at that price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
