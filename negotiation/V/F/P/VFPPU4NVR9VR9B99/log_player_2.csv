"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my maximum, but I can likely get a better price. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 falls short of the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too high.  I'm going to try to push for a lower price.  There are still rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
