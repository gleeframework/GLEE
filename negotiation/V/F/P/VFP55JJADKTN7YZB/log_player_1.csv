Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than John's offer:** This motivates Bob to negotiate.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:** This leaves room for potential negotiation and a win-win outcome. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to Bob ($1,200,000).  By rejecting this offer, I can try to get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, as Bob has shown interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work.  This price is still significantly less than what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Highlighting the value to Bob:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him strengthens my position and encourages him to accept.
* **Maintaining a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand my intentions and respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a fair compromise. It's closer to my desired price than his previous offer. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit that is higher than selling to John. 
* **Time considerations:**  While I could potentially try to negotiate a higher price, it's unclear how much further Bob is willing to go. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of a prolonged negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
