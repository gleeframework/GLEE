"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can definitely get a better price than $110. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer of $90. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant saving compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better price than $105. Let's see if we can nudge her closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're inching closer to a potential agreement. This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to compromise but still want a price closer to our initial target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I can offer it to you for $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice is offering her lowest price, and it's a significant savings compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a better price than this."
