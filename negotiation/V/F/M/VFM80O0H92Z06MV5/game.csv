"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product for me.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $10,500. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,800. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,800 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. I'm willing to offer $10,600. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than $10,800. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $10,700. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me and the effort I've put into acquiring it. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",10700.0,Alice,5,
