"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than John's offer. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a substantial discount.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a polite and interested tone.  It's important to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and gives us a baseline for the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my alternative price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing the deal since I can buy it from John for the same price."
