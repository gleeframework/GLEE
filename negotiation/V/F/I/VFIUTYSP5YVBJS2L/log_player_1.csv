Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $12,000 from John, so that's your fallback option.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential $2,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price higher than $12,000 without going so high that Bob walks away.  

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Honest:** The message is clear about your intention to sell and the fact that this is a limited-time offer.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  $13,500 is significantly above your minimum but leaves room for Bob to feel like he might get a deal if he negotiates. 
* **Justification:**  While not overly detailed, mentioning ""unique value"" provides a subtle reason for the higher price.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter your offer. Be ready to adjust, but always keep your $12,000 minimum in mind. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Emphasize that John is a guaranteed buyer to encourage Bob to act quickly."
