"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 seems a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a fair price considering the value and rarity of the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $13500 for the product. It's still a great deal considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? I think that's a fair price considering the value and rarity of the product.",12800.0,Bob,4,
