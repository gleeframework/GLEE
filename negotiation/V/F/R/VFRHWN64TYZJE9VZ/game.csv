"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $750,000? This would be a good compromise and a good price for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $725,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $737,500? This is a reasonable compromise, and we can close the deal.  What do you say?",737500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $737,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm going to make a new offer of $712,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",712500.0,Bob,6,
