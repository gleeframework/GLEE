"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's find common ground, I'm sure we can work something out.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 as a final offer. This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's make it happen, I'm confident we can agree on this price.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $12,800 as a final offer. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. ",12800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a little further and come down to $12,900 as my final offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  What do you say?",12900.0,Alice,7,
