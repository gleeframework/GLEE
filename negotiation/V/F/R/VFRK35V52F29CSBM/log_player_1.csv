"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefit to Bob by emphasizing the product's value to him.

**Note:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to be firm if Bob is unwilling to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **John is an Option:**  While I'm not ready to sell to John yet, knowing I have that option gives me leverage during the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to find a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's find common ground, I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Rationale:** My counter-offer of $13,250 represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him, highlighting that even at $13,250, it's a good deal.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone, emphasizing the idea of finding ""common ground."" 

**Strategy:**

* **Moving Towards a Deal:**  I'm hoping that by demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, I can entice Bob to accept a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not rushing into a deal, keeping in mind my option to sell to John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob is getting closer, $12,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **More Room for Negotiation:** I believe we can still reach a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not in a rush to close the deal, as I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 as a final offer.

```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $12,800 as a final offer. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob is getting closer, $12,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undercuts my value.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** I'm aware that I have only 4 rounds left, but I'm not desperate enough to accept an offer that's so far below my desired price.
* **John's Offer is Still Available:** I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price that is closer to my desired value. I will use my remaining rounds wisely, trying to reach a compromise while keeping John's offer in mind."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a little further and come down to $12,900 as my final offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer (Again):** I'm emphasizing this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to reach a decision.
* **Small Compromise:**  I'm only coming down $100 from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway but also maintaining my value.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that ""this opportunity might slip away,"" subtly hinting at the possibility of selling to John.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm reiterating that $12,900 is a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm trying to close the gap in price to make accepting the offer more appealing to Bob. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still holding onto the option of selling to John if Bob rejects this offer. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to make a decision that balances maximizing profit with the risk of missing out on a deal."
