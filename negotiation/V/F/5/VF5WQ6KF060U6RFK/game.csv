"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering both the product's worth and my budget. I look forward to your response!",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the potential we both see in it, I'm willing to come down to $980,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll agree. Let me know your decision.",980000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $960,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. I hope you'll find this proposal acceptable.",960000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $960,000 is still not a price I can accept.  How about we split the difference and settle on $970,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make a deal!",970000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. However, I'm still concerned about staying within my budget. I would like to counter with a price of $965,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, and I hope you'll consider it favorably.",965000.0,Bob,6,
