This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation, but still gives him room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage. It also leaves me with a decent profit while keeping the option to sell to John if the deal falls through."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering both the product's worth and my budget. I look forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While I'm close to my desired price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold.  I've already made several concessions and it's clear that we are unlikely to reach an agreement. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
