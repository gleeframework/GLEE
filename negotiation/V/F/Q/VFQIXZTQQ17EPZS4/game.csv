"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1750000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves us both with a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
