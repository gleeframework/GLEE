Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us! I know this is a valuable product for you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $600,000? This would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's far below what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price still allows you to make a substantial profit, and it's a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 800000}
