"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $600,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price still allows you to make a substantial profit, and it's a fair deal for me.",800000.0,Alice,3,
