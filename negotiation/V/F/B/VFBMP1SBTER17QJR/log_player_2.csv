"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is too high. While $130 is less than your $150 maximum, there's room to negotiate a better deal.  You should make a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and finding a middle ground.
* **Significant Difference:**  Offering $100 creates a significant gap from Alice's initial price, signaling that you're serious about getting a better deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message remains polite and respectful, avoiding language that might offend Alice and derail the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $115 is a reasonable price, falling well below your $150 maximum and representing a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited Time:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better outcome, and there's a risk that Alice might increase her price or that the negotiation could stall.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Buying from John for $150 would mean overpaying by $35 compared to Alice's current offer. 

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise by meeting in the middle. Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids potential drawbacks of further negotiation."
