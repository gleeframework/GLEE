Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, as the product is worth $15,000 to him, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This strategy aims to secure a good price while leaving space for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer, but still securing a price closer to my desired value. This should keep the negotiations moving forward while demonstrating my willingness to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still a good deal for me, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for $10,000 is too great.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
