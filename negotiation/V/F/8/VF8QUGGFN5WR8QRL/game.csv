"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm prepared to pay $850000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on the product while also being a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. Considering your offer of $850000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your desire for a better price. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $875000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $862500.  This demonstrates my sincere interest in purchasing this product and allows us to close this deal quickly.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $862500. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $870000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find acceptable. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $870000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $865000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the very last offer I can make. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",865000.0,Bob,6,
