Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know you'll benefit greatly from it."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Confident Approach:**  The language is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob without directly revealing my bottom line. 

**Important Note:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John, there's always a slight risk Bob might not accept. I'm balancing this risk with the potential for a higher profit."
