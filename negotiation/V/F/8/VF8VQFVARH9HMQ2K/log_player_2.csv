(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to buy the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget and a better deal overall. I'm also worried that continuing to negotiate with Alice might result in a stalemate or lead to further concessions that could ultimately harm my position. It's time to move on and secure the product from John."
