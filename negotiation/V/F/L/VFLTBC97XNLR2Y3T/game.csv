"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move closer to your number. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $962,500.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a mutually beneficial deal.",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $962,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  I'm willing to consider $995,000 as my final offer. This is a considerable concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.",995000.0,Alice,5,
