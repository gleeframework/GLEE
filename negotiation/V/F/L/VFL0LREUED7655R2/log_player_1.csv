Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a price of $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for this price. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The initial high price helps gauge Bob's level of interest. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything. If he counters, it suggests he's seriously considering it. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) might make him feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to negotiate it down. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but always keep your minimum of $15,000 in mind."
