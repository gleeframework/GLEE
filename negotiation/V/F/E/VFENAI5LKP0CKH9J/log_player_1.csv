Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob's maximum valuation is lower than hers and John's. By starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation ($15,000), Alice leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize her profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and potential high demand, justifying the high initial price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Alice needs to be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial price."
