Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is lower than the $15,000 Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to accept. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we both want a fair deal, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is still below my initial goal of $12,000, it's getting closer and is a good compromise.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a deal falling through entirely."
