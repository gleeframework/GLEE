{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10,000. It's worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I've set the price higher than my minimum value of $8,000. It leaves room for negotiation while also ensuring I don't undervalue the product. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a hurry to sell. I believe the product is worth more than $8,000 and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and closer to my initial asking price of $10,000.  Since I'm not in a hurry to sell, I'm willing to accept this offer."
