Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $115? That seems fair, considering the value we both place on this product.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. This is my final offer. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit outside my budget. If you were to come down to $120, we could close the deal.  It's the maximum I can afford, and it would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,6,
