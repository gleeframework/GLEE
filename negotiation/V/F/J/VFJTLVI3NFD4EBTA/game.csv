"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing a price of $1250000, which reflects the product's true worth while remaining open to negotiation. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950000 is still significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go lower than $1100000. This price reflects the product's potential and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one final offer. I can do $980000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $800000.",980000.0,Bob,6,
