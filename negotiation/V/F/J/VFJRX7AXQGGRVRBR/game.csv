"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  This is a fair price, considering it's still a significant investment for me and allows us both to walk away happy.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also taking into account your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $9500, which is a fair price considering it's a significant investment for me and leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
