"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the most strategic move at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price drop. He's offering $9,000, which is still below his maximum budget, but is a substantial discount from Alice's offer. This is a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above his maximum budget.  He has rounds remaining to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and continuing to counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still trying to stay within his budget.  Offering $9,500 shows a willingness to compromise without going over his $10,000 limit.  This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, which could encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still $800 higher than his maximum.  Bob still has rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price.  Rejecting and continuing to counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his maximum budget. This counteroffer is a final attempt to convince Alice to accept his price. If she rejects, he can go to John and purchase the product for $10,000, ensuring he gets a deal within his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $500 lower than Bob's maximum budget, and he's already reached his limit. He has only a few rounds left, and there's no guarantee he'll get a better price.  It's more advantageous to buy from John and get the product for $10,000.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget, even if it means not getting the absolute lowest price."
