"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price that reflects its substantial value. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let's start with $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer that's still within a reasonable range for Bob, considering its value to him is $1,500,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation without immediately triggering a rejection.
* **Positive Tone:** A positive message sets the tone for a productive negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response to see if he accepts or counteroffers.
* If he counteroffers, I'll adjust my strategy based on the counteroffer to maximize my profit within the 10 rounds.
* If he rejects, I'll consider the possibility of selling to John,  keeping in mind my goal of earning as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation. How about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. This indicates that Bob sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Selling to John immediately would secure $1,000,000, but I can potentially earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground. 
* My goal is to maintain a strong negotiating position while also encouraging Bob to continue the dialogue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, let's aim for a number that reflects the true value of this product. How about $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's, showing that I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiations moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profitable deal.
* If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate with him, keeping in mind John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I propose a price of $1,325,000. This seems like a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's counteroffer is only $25,000 lower than my previous offer. This shows a strong willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only six rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or a stalemate is increasing.
* **Profit Margin:**  $1,325,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer ensures a healthy profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the deal with Bob and ensure a smooth transfer of the product."
