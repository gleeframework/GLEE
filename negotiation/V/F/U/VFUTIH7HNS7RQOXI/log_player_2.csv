"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what you're willing to pay, you can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your desire to negotiate. It's still within your budget and allows room for compromise.  If Alice rejects this offer, you can still make another counteroffer or choose to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still not ideal. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. It's worth exploring a lower counteroffer since John's price is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from my previous one, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a lower price. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest one, and it might be enough to convince her to close the deal. If she rejects again, I will likely buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. The risk of going back and forth further is that the price might end up higher than John's.  While John is more expensive, buying from him guarantees I'll have the product for a price I'm comfortable with."
