Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I think it's a fantastic deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($80) and my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to his maximum willingness to pay. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The initial offer helps me understand how interested Bob is in the product. His response (acceptance, a counteroffer close to my asking price, or a low counteroffer) will provide valuable information for the next step.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation. I won't settle for anything less than $150 because I have a better alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I know I have a guaranteed sale with John at that price. Therefore, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Bob for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price, but I can't go as low as $120.  How about we meet in the middle at $170? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I'm lowering my price significantly from the initial offer but staying above my minimum ($150) and John's offer. 
* **Justification:**  By slightly adjusting my language (""meet in the middle"") and reiterating the product's value, I'm aiming to make the offer more appealing and encourage Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still holding a strong position.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm comfortable walking away and selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will reach my minimum. At this point, it's in my best interest to take the guaranteed sale with John at $150."
