"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $110 is closer, but to be honest, my absolute top limit is $80.  If you're willing to go that low, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",80.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I've already gone lower than I'm comfortable with.
