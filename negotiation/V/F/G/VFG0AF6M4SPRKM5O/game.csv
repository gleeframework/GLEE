"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we settle at $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a reasonable compromise given the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
