"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $800000.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $800000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1200000. I'm confident this product holds significant value, and I'm eager to explore a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1200000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000, but I'm still looking for a bit more. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, $1050000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which reflects the value I see in the product while also being a fair compromise. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can meet you at $1080000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1080000 is closer, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go to $1090000, which is a fair meeting point for us both. It's important for me to feel like I'm getting a good deal, and I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also ensuring a successful agreement. What do you say?",1090000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see that we're really close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I can meet you at $1090500, which is just a slight increase from your last offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1090500.0,Alice,7,
