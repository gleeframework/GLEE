Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room in case Bob wants to negotiate a bit.  
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives us a strong fallback position. This allows us to be more confident in our offer to Bob."
