Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000.  This is a one-time offer, so let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower. Offering it to Bob at $10,000 maximizes your potential profit.
* **Direct Approach:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the value of the product while making it clear this is Bob's sole chance to buy. 

While Bob might reject this offer as it's above his perceived value, it ensures you don't leave money on the table."
