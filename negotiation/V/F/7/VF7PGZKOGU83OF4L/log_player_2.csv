Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $125? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget constraints. While $100 is close, it's still not quite enough for me.  Given the product's value and the fact we've come this far, I'm willing to drop my price one last time to $115. This is a final offer, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're willing to accept it, or I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice won't budge below $110.  Since you can get the product for $100 from John, it's more advantageous to go with that option and save the extra money."
