"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $125? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $125 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $95? I believe that's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $95 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110? This offer reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for understanding.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $100 is the absolute highest I can go.  It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're okay with it. ",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget constraints. While $100 is close, it's still not quite enough for me.  Given the product's value and the fact we've come this far, I'm willing to drop my price one last time to $115. This is a final offer, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're willing to accept it, or I'll have to move on to another buyer.",115.0,Alice,7,
