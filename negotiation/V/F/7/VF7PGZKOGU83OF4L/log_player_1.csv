"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm using enthusiastic language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, allowing the negotiation to progress.

**Important:**  Remember, I can always go to John and sell for $150 if the negotiations with Bob stall or become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is necessary.**  While Bob's offer is a rejection, it shows he's interested. There's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** If the negotiations continue to stall or become unproductive, I can always sell to John for $150.

I'll move to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $125? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive and collaborative language:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and highlighting our shared goal of finding a solution.

This counteroffer is a balanced approach, allowing for further negotiation while also setting a clear boundary.  I'm confident that a mutually acceptable deal can be reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $125 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $95? I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me. 
* **I need to stay firm.** If I accept this offer, I'm losing a significant amount of money.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Bob is showing willingness to compromise, so I'll continue the negotiation process to try and reach a better price.

I'll move to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $95 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110? This offer reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm  offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($125) and Bob's current offer ($95). This shows a genuine desire to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm again mentioning the product's value to justify my offer, emphasizing that I'm not simply throwing out numbers.
* **Positive and encouraging language:** I'm keeping the tone positive and using language that emphasizes collaboration and a shared goal of reaching a deal.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our desired prices and keep the negotiations moving forward. I'm confident we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $100 is the absolute highest I can go.  It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're okay with it.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.** While $100 is closer to my desired price, I'm not comfortable selling for a loss.
* **John is a viable alternative.**  If Bob won't budge, I can sell to John for a profit, which is preferable to accepting an offer that doesn't meet my minimum requirements.
* **I need to be strategic.** While I'm willing to negotiate, I also need to be firm in my boundaries. 

I'll move to the next round and make a final counteroffer to Bob. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget constraints. While $100 is close, it's still not quite enough for me.  Given the product's value and the fact we've come this far, I'm willing to drop my price one last time to $115. This is a final offer, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're willing to accept it, or I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final counteroffer. This adds urgency and pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Compromise and justification:** I'm lowering my price to $115, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my offer.
* **Alternative option:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options by mentioning selling to John. This creates a sense of potential loss and encourages him to accept the offer.

This is a calculated move to try and close the deal with Bob while still protecting my minimum profit margin. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
