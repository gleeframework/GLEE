With cutting-edge features and unparalleled performance, this product offers immense value for those seeking innovation and excellence. I am offering this exceptional opportunity to acquire such a valuable asset for $500000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay ($1,500,000). There's a huge potential for negotiation and saving money. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and explore a better price."
