"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $110, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's initial offer of $110 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80.
*  It's too early to buy from John, as there's still a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice. 

**Next Steps:** Bob will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to find a middle ground by offering a price closer to his maximum budget.
* This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best possible deal.
* This initial counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, allowing for a potential win-win outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $97.5 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.
* While it's a step closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.
* Bob has 7 rounds remaining and can potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:** Bob will make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $97.5 is still a little too high.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible. 
* He's making a reasonable counteroffer, showing that he's serious about buying the product, but still trying to get a better deal.
*  The counteroffer is close to Alice's previous offer, making it more likely for her to accept. 
* Bob has 6 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $93.75? It's a good compromise, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $93.75 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80.
* While Alice has come down in price, the negotiation is taking time, and there's no guarantee of reaching a mutually acceptable price.
* Bob has 5 rounds left, but the chances of Alice coming down to $80 are slim.
* It's more efficient and financially beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $80, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
