"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product for $125. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product just as much at this price.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of $110, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling the product for $115. It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",115.0,Alice,5,
