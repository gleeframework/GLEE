"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I can do $8500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $8200. How about we settle on $8400? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",8400.0,Alice,5,
