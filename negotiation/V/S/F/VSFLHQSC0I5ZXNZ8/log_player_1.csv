{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances the following factors:

* **My minimum:** I want to get at least $120 from John if I have to, so I'm starting slightly below that.
* **Bob's value:** I'm offering a price below what the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to buy.
* **Negotiation space:** Leaving room for negotiation allows for potential concessions and a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in buying it, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is more than Bob's initial value of $80, it is still below my minimum desired price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget. I'm willing to come down to $100 for the product. This is a great deal considering its value, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $92? I'm really interested in buying the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although $92 is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below the $120 I can get from John. While I appreciate Bob's efforts to negotiate, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed higher price. Selling to John is the most financially sensible decision at this point."
