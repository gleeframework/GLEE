"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product for a price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding to purchase from John at your fallback price."
