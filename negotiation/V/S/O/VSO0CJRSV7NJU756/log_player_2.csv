{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above your maximum budget. You've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to budge further. At this point, it's more financially advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
