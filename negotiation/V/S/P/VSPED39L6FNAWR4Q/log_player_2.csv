The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $90.  I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice $75 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $80 to me and $80 to her."

I'm still willing to pay $75 for the product, so I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 78}

I'm offering Alice $78. This is a good compromise, as it's closer to her price of $80 and still lower than what she's offering."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82

Alice has come down to $82, which is close to my maximum price, but I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation.  It's better for me to just buy from John for $80 and be done with it."
