Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $115. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob without him rejecting the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 (because you can sell it to John for that amount).
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product between $100 and $120 gives Bob a chance to get it for a price he finds valuable while still giving you a profit. 
* **The $115 Offer:** This price is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down."
