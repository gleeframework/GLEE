Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a high price, but also leaving some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium for the product, knowing it's worth more to him.  I'm also trying to avoid immediately going too low, as that might set a lower bargaining range for the rest of the negotiation."
