{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit above my minimum value.  I'm aiming to maximize my earnings while still appealing to Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is a good offer, I'm still confident I can do better. I'll counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum, to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13,250. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $10,000 and still leaves room for profit. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John or going through more rounds of negotiation that could lead to a lower offer."
