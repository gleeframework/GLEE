"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my assessment of the product's unique features and long-term potential leads me to a different figure.  To move us closer to an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised offer balances both our interests.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800,000. I believe this price reflects the fair market value considering the product's condition and its potential. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  Let's think outside the box for a moment. How about we explore a structured payment plan that makes this purchase more manageable for you, while still reflecting the value of the product? Would you be open to discussing a payment plan spread over a set period with agreed-upon installments?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to explore payment plans, I'm still focused on finding a price that fits my budget. My maximum offer remains $800,000.  If we can't reach an agreement on that price, I may need to consider other options. Let's focus on finding a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
