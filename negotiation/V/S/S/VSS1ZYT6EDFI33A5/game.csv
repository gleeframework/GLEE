"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $10,000.",9800.0,Bob,4,
