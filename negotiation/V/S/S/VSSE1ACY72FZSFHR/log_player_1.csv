Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a high price, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a good balance between maximizing my profit and giving Bob a reasonable price considering his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.  $900,000 is still a good price for me and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $25,000 less than my initial counteroffer and is above my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer is the most logical choice to ensure a quick sale and a relatively good profit."
