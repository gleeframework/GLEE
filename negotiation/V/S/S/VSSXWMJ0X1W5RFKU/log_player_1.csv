Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I aim for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) but slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While my initial offer is high, it allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing his willingness to pay a premium.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate and can walk away from a low offer from Bob."
