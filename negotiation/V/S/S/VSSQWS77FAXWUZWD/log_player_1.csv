"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting position and potentially encourages Bob to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is now very close to my target. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal. There's a risk of further negotiation, but the potential gains are not worth the risk of ending up with a lower price or even selling to John for less."
