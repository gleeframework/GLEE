Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $150, offering it slightly below his valuation at $140 maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $140, there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price.  
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John provides a safety net. You can afford to aim higher with Bob."
