"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above my target of $1,000,000.  I want to see if I can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my target price, but $1,025,000 is still a little too high. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,025,000. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to sell the product and me to get it at a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate Bob's persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $1,020,000 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is firm on $1,020,000. While this is a good price, it's still slightly higher than my goal.  Since John offers the product at my target price of $1,000,000, it makes more sense to buy from him.  I don't want to risk further negotiations with Alice only to find she won't budge."
