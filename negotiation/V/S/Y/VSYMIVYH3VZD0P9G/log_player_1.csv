Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in.  It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's fair:** It's above your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's enticing:** It shows you're willing to negotiate and gives Bob a reason to accept.

Let me know what Bob's response is and we'll adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product and am willing to pay up to $110 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value the product holds for Bob ($150).  

We need to push for a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows us to counter and potentially get closer to the $125 price point we initially offered."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $115?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** We've lowered our price from the initial offer, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:**  We highlight the benefit of the deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's value to him.
* **Stay above our minimum:**  We're still above our $100 minimum, ensuring we get a profit. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I can only agree to a price of $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While we'd prefer to get closer to $125, Bob has been firm at $110.  Since this is still above our minimum price of $100 and a better deal than selling to John, we should accept his offer."
