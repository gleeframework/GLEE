Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'll have to pass on that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss $950,000? It's a bit more than your offer, but still a great deal for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $850,000, which would be $900,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Would you consider $875,000?  That's right in the middle of our last offers and feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $925,000, which is a bit higher than your latest offer, but still a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle.  $925,000 is a significant savings over John's offer, and continuing to push might annoy Alice and risk her pulling out of the deal entirely."
