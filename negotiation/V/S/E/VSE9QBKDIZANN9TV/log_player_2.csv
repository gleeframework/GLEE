"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount. It's worth seeing if Bob can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $950,000 is a bold move, but it's still within Alice's desired profit range. This counteroffer establishes a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price point, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to push for a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so Bob has time to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price point. This counteroffer of $1,000,000 shows that Bob is serious about acquiring the product while still trying to save some money. This offer might be enough to persuade Alice, but if not, there's still room for a few more rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has two choices:

* **Accept Alice's offer:**  This gets him the product at a price significantly lower than what John is offering.
* **Reject Alice's offer:** This risks a stalemate. Alice may not budge further, and Bob could end up buying from John at a higher price.

Given that there are only 5 rounds left, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting. Accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to ensure Bob gets the product at a good price."
