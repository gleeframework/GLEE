"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer,  $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is closer to my budget.  Let's try to close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $8,875. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
