Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,025,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your latest one.
