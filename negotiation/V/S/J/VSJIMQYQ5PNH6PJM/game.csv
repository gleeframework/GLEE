"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,050,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000.  I think this is a fair price given the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find a meeting point.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,025,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your latest one. I'm thinking of a price of $1,062,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",1062500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,062,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,040,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution at this price. Let's work together to close this deal.",1040000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $1,040,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,055,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",1055000.0,Alice,7,
