Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I understand your budget, but this product is really worth more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me some breathing room.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I see we're both trying to find common ground.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to make one final offer of $11,250.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll need to move on to other options. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to switch tactics. Alice is clearly holding firm on a price above $11,000.  While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll reach a point where it makes sense for you compared to John's offer of $8,000.  Buying from John guarantees the best price and avoids further negotiation risk."
