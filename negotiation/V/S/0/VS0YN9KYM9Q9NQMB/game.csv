"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to negotiating a fair price. How about $13,000? Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I understand your budget, but this product is really worth more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me some breathing room.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we try $10,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see we're both trying to find common ground.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to bump my offer to $10,750.  I'm hoping that shows you I'm serious about buying, but I also need to stick to my budget.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to make one final offer of $11,250.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll need to move on to other options. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,7,
