"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a rare opportunity and I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable to you. My initial price is $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired value.  I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher or, at the very least, gain more information about his maximum price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000, which is my absolute maximum. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000 is too high, so I'll try to meet her at $1320000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is getting closer to my desired price point, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a higher price. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can push for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from a deal that works for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,290,000 is getting closer, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a higher price. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can push for a better deal. The price of the product to John is still a decent option, but it's better to try to get more from Bob if possible."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of rounds, and while Bob is getting closer, his offer of $1,280,000 is still not high enough for me.  I've already compromised significantly, and I don't believe I can get him to go much higher.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent return and I'm guaranteed a sale."
