"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $165? It's still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $165 is a bit more than what I was hoping for, I am still interested in purchasing the product. Could you consider selling it to me for $160? This would allow us to meet closer to the middle of our price range.",160.0,Bob,4,
