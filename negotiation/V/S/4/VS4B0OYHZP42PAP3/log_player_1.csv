"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.
