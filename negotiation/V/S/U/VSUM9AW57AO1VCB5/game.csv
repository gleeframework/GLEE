"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. Considering the market value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I have in mind.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the value this product brings.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the market value and my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
