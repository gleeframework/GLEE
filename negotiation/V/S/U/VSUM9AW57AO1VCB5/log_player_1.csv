""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. Considering the market value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I have in mind.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the market value and my budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $1,900,000 is a strong price. It's a significant profit above my minimum, making it a good deal overall."
