"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, we're extending this opportunity to you at an introductory price of $120. We hope you find this offer compelling and look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a lower price from Alice.  You have a good fallback option with John, so there's no rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We understand your budget constraints and are willing to accommodate your needs. For the sake of closing this deal, we're lowering our price to $95. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while providing you with a valuable product. Please let us know if this revised offer suits your requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still closer to your goal price of $80. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to go lower in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $88 for the product.  I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We appreciate your persistence, Bob. To ensure a mutually beneficial outcome, we are now offering the product at $90. This price reflects our commitment to finding a solution that meets both our financial goals and your budgetary constraints. We hope this revised offer aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While you could continue negotiating with Alice, you're getting close to your ideal price from John.  At this point, it's better to secure the product for $80 from John rather than risk Alice rejecting your counteroffer again and potentially driving the price up."
