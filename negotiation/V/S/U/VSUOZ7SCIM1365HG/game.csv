"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning this product and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you laying out the value proposition, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, recognizing its potential value. This price is fair considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. Considering its true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value you'll gain from owning the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering your own valuation and the value it brings to my business. I believe this is a good compromise that benefits both of us. Let's reach a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
