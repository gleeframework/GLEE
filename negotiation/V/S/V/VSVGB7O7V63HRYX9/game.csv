"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my best price, but I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the product's value, $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which reflects a compromise and shows my genuine interest.  This is my final offer before I need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
