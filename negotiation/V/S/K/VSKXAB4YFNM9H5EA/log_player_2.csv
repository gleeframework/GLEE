"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and market value, I'm asking for $22,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  It makes sense to reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is well above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000 at this time. Let me know if that's a starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I could consider letting it go for $19,000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is still asking for too much. While it's closer to my budget, I'm going to reject and try to negotiate lower.  $8,000 is still a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. However,  $10,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind. Let's meet in the middle - how about $16,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while hopefully still working for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still asking for too much. $16,000 is above my budget, so I'll reject and see if I can get her down further.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal, or just buy from John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $16,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
