"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to your asking price, but I still think $8,750 is a fair price for the product. I'd be willing to meet you there.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $8,750 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,900.  This is my final offer.",8900.0,Alice,5,
