Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down. If he counters, you can still potentially settle at a price higher than $10,000.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message is framed to highlight the product's value and Bob's exclusive opportunity, potentially increasing his perceived value and willingness to pay a premium.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in negotiations. If Bob outright rejects your initial offer, you can always reconsider and lower the price, knowing your fallback option with John is still available."
