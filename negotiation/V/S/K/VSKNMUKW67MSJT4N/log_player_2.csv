"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is close to your maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  While I'm interested, $115 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a good deal considering my maximum is $120.  Accepting the offer allows me to get the product for a decent price without risking a further price increase or losing the opportunity to John."
