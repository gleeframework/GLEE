"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,400,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than his maximum budget.  He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're hoping to meet in the middle, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,325,000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is getting closer, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  He's already had several rounds of negotiation, and there's no guarantee that he'll be able to get Alice down to his desired price.  It's better to secure the product from John at his budget-friendly price."
