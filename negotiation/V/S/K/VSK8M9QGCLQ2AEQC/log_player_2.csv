"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're looking to pay no more than $800,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a new offer of $1100000.
