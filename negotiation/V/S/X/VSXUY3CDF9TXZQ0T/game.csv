"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm really hoping to get the product for closer to $8,000. That's my absolute limit, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,000?  That's still a great price for you, and a fair compromise for me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
