"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate the enthusiasm!  While I like the product, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $140?  I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a great compromise between our initial offers, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference and meet at $155.  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $155 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, though! How about we meet at $157.50? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",157.5,Alice,5,
