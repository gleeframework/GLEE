"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exceptional value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the value I see in the product. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to his perceived value, I have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John right now would mean securing my minimum, but I might be able to get more from Bob with strategic counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and use positive language (""appreciate"", ""understand"") to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere. However, I stand firm on the product's value justifying a price above his offer.
* **Significant Drop, Strategic Position:** I make a significant drop from my initial offer ($150,000) to show flexibility and willingness to deal. However,  the new price is still closer to my starting point than Bob's, aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired outcome.
* **Open for Continued Negotiation:** I end with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond and continue the negotiation, keeping the momentum going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's aim for a more reasonable price. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it.  I'm hopeful we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to counteroffer again, but I need to signal that my price floor is approaching.  I'll aim for a smaller concession this round to steer the negotiation closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While your offer is tempting, the product's true value and scarcity on the market make it difficult to go much lower. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,050,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer, considering its unique benefits.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I start by recognizing Bob's effort and acknowledge his offer as ""tempting"" to keep the tone positive.
* **Justifying the Price:** I reiterate the product's unique value and scarcity as reasons for the price, aiming to subtly shift his perception of its worth.
* **Smaller Concession, Firm Stance:** I propose a price of $1,050,000, which is a smaller concession than previous rounds ($100,000). This signals I'm reaching my lower limit while still showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Call to Action:** I end by directly asking for his thoughts, encouraging a response and hopefully, acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's bridge the gap.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product, a fair compromise considering the value I see in it and the price we're both aiming for. This is my final offer before I consider other options.  Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his final offer, signaling he is unlikely to go any higher. 
* **Below Minimum, Time Constraint:**  Even with further negotiation, it's unlikely Bob will meet my $1,000,000 minimum. We are also past the halfway point in the rounds.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. 

While there's a chance I could squeeze a little more from Bob, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. It's a better business decision to take John's offer and secure my minimum price."
