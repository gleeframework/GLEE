"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,300,000 is well over Bob's budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating to see if Alice will come down closer to his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the value I see in the product. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,150,000 is still too high for Bob. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's aim for a more reasonable price. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it.  I'm hopeful we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While your offer is tempting, the product's true value and scarcity on the market make it difficult to go much lower. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,050,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer, considering its unique benefits.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $1,050,000 is still too high. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice down further.  He has several more rounds and could always buy from John for $800,000 if he gets stuck."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's bridge the gap.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product, a fair compromise considering the value I see in it and the price we're both aiming for. This is my final offer before I consider other options.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
