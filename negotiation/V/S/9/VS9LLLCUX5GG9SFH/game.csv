"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90,  which is still a great price for a product worth $100 to you. Let's meet in the middle!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $88, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
