"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I was thinking that since we're already at $8,000, I could stretch a bit further. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
