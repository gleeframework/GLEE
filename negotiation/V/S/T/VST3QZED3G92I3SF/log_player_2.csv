"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a high-quality item. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  Therefore, it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $8,250 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best course of action. He can potentially secure a better deal by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I was thinking that since we're already at $8,000, I could stretch a bit further. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,200 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's only $200 more than what Bob is willing to pay, Bob has been consistently trying to get the price down to $8,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $8,000. It saves him time and potential frustration of further negotiation."
