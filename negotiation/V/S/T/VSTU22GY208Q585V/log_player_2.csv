Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product and your offer, I propose a final price of $13500. This reflects a compromise that takes into account both the product's value and your budget. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While further negotiation is possible,  Bob has already made two counteroffers and it's likely that continuing to bargain won't result in a lower price. Given the limited number of rounds, it's more prudent for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000, ensuring a purchase within his budget."
