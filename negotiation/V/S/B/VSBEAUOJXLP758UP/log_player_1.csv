Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price of $130. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. If he rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
