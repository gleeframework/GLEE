Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering the product for $950,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and its potential value to you.  It's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $725,000 is simply too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $850,000. This is my final offer. If you're truly interested in acquiring this product, I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still trying to push you above your absolute limit. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice when you can get the product for your target price elsewhere."
