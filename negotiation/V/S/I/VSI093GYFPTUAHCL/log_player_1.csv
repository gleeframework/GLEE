"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like I value his opinion.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for his thoughts, signaling that I'm willing to discuss the price. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation that leads to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.**  Selling for $8,000 would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **There are still rounds left.** I can use these rounds to try and negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and continue to explore potential for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, I need to at least get $9,500 for the product. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe it will be worth it for you too. Let's meet in the middle - how about $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that it's a significant investment for me, hinting at its potential worth to him. 
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I use this phrase to imply a fair compromise and a win-win situation. 

By offering a counteroffer closer to Bob's price point, I'm aiming to encourage him to consider a deal that is more profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Time is a factor:** With limited rounds remaining, it's crucial to secure a deal, even if it's not the ideal price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and I might not be able to get a better price from him.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether. It's a practical decision that balances the need for profit with the time constraints of the negotiation."
