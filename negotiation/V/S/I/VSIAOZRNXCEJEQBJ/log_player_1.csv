Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant premium on the value to Bob, but it allows me to see if he's willing to pay a high price. It also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
