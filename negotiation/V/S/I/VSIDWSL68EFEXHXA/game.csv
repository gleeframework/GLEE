"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to this amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $800,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm offering.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price still leaves you a good margin of profit, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand the value of your product and would like to continue our discussion. Could we aim for $825,000 as a compromise? This price respects the value while staying within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
