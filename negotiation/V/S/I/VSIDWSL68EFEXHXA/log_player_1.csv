Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $950,000 is still within Bob's range of potential profit, making it likely he'll consider the offer.
* **It's lower than my minimum acceptable price:** This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **It shows confidence:** By starting high, I signal that I believe in the product's worth.

I'll be ready to negotiate further if needed, but I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,000,000 if I don't get a satisfactory offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, but still within Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $800,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm offering.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price still leaves you a good margin of profit, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand the value of your product and would like to continue our discussion. Could we aim for $825,000 as a compromise? This price respects the value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is still a significant drop from my initial target, it's a good compromise. I'm confident that I can find a way to make up the difference through other opportunities.  It's important to secure a deal and move forward, and $825,000 is a solid outcome considering Bob's initial offer."
