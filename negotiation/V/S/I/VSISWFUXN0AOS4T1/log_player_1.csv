Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you taking the time to discuss the product with me. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This would still give you a good profit, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
