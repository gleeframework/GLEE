"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you taking the time to discuss the product with me. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This would still give you a good profit, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement here.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11750.0,Alice,5,
