Round 5

We're still in the bargaining range and Alice is coming down.  Let's see if we can push her a little closer to $80."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $78 is still a little too low for me. How about we settle on $82? That's a good middle ground and will allow us both to walk away happy with the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go much lower and we're already below our initial limit. Accepting at $82 is a good deal!"
