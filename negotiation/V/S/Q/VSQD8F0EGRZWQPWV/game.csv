"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a significant increase from my last offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $85, which is a good compromise considering the value I place on the product. Let's make this deal!",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $85 is close, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $78?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $78 is still a little too low for me. How about we settle on $82? That's a good middle ground and will allow us both to walk away happy with the deal. What do you say?",82.0,Alice,7,
