{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you. Feel free to consider this offer and let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a high anchor. This can make subsequent offers seem more reasonable by comparison. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counter, giving you the opportunity to gradually lower the price while still aiming for a figure well above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 provides you leverage. You can negotiate more confidently, as you're not desperate to make the sale to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to engage in further negotiation with Bob based on his response."
