Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are nearing the point where the difference is less significant compared to my guaranteed sale with John. Accepting $975,000 is a strong return and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me pushing him away in further rounds."
