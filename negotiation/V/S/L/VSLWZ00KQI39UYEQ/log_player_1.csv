Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:** While I'm not explicitly stating why my price is higher than Bob's perceived value, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies there are reasons for the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and invites discussion. By asking ""What do you think?"", I signal that I'm open to hearing Bob's perspective and potentially negotiating.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer, though still above your minimum.
* **Market Context:**  Is this a product in high demand? If so, a higher starting price might be even more justifiable."
