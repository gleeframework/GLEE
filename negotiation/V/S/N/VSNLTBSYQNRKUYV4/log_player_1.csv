Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always wise to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""true worth"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John is waiting in the wings with a $1,500,000 offer gives you leverage.  You are not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have the security of John's offer and room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your desire for a competitive price. However, the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,750,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down $150,000  shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but the decrease is not drastic. 
* **Holding Ground:** You're still significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum, aiming to steer him closer to your target range.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's value reminds Bob of its benefits and justifies the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. There's no further benefit to negotiating, as you're unlikely to get a better offer from Bob. Accepting his offer secures the sale at your desired price point."
