"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and it's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
