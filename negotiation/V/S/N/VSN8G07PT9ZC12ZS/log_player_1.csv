Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I believe it's a great deal and would be very valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John is a guaranteed $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is just below your minimum, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but the message emphasizes value and time sensitivity to encourage a purchase.

This approach aims for the best-case scenario of Bob accepting the $119, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
