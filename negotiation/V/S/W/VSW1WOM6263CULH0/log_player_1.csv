"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is a backup buyer at $15,000, so I'm not willing to go below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $18,000 is better than John's offer, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a bit more. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm offering $18,500. This is a compromise, but I'm still trying to maximize my profit. With only five rounds left, I need to get closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I have a few rounds left, so there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $17,500.  With only a few rounds left, I want to secure a deal. This offer is a good compromise, as it's closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  I only have two rounds left and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $16,500 is a reasonable compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $15,000. I'll accept Bob's offer."
