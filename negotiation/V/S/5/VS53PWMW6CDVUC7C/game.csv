"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $10,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really think that's the most I can afford.",10000.0,Bob,4,
