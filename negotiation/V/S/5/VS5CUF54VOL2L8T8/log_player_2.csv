"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a great price considering its value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  He should try to negotiate further to get a lower price before considering buying from John."
