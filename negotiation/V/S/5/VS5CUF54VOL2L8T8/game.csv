"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $800000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,
