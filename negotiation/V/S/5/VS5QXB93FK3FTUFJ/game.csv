,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $120.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this for $130.  It's my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm really pushing my budget here, but $145 is still just a little too high.  Would you be willing to do $135?  That would be a great deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",135.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go below $140. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $140. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",140.0,Alice,7,
