"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $12,000 when you can get it from John for $10,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer of $9,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's asking price, but still within the range I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay, especially since John is selling the product for $10,000.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
