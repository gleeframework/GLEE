"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you compared to the market price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking $1,050,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and our willingness to negotiate.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
