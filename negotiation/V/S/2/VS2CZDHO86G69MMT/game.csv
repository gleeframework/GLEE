"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $8,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in buying it for $7,500.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,000?  That's my final offer, and it's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay.",8000.0,Bob,4,
