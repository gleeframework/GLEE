"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more motivated to reach an agreement. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price is high enough that Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving me a chance to see where he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  While $11,000 is above my minimum, I can likely get a better price. I have 8 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further.
* **Exploring Higher Offers:** By rejecting, I can gauge Bob's maximum price and see if he's willing to come closer to my desired range. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** It's important to avoid settling too early.  Rejecting allows me to maintain control and potentially secure a more advantageous deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000, but that's my final offer.  Remember, this product is worth significantly more to you, and this is a great opportunity to secure it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price slightly, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's high value to him, hoping to encourage him to accept.
* **Finality:** I present this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and potentially push Bob to agree. 
* **Strategic Bargaining:** $12,000 is still a good price for me, but it's low enough to potentially entice Bob without being too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $10500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $500 above my absolute minimum. While it's tempting to take it, I have time to potentially negotiate a better price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially with 6 rounds remaining. Rejecting allows me to explore if Bob is willing to go higher.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting, I can potentially trigger a counteroffer from Bob that's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $10,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows good faith and increases the likelihood of an agreement.
* **Fairness and Value:** I emphasize that this price is ""fair"" for both of us, highlighting the value of the product and avoiding a deadlock.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $11,250 is still a good price for me, as it's above my absolute minimum. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Urgency:** While not explicit, the message implies that I am willing to negotiate, but  also hints at a potential deadline (the remaining rounds)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $11250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for the product. It's the most I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Deadlock:** Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but it's clear that he's unwilling to budge further. 
* **Time Constraints:** With only 4 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate risks ending up with a worse outcome.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, securing the $10,000 sale to John guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation.  
* **Risk Management:**  There's a chance Bob might agree to a higher price in future rounds, but there's also a risk he might walk away, leaving me with nothing. Selling to John minimizes risk and guarantees a decent profit."
