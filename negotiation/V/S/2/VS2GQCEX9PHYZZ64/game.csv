"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit to $12000, but that's my final offer.  Remember, this product is worth significantly more to you, and this is a great opportunity to secure it.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $10500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?,10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $10500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11250? It's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $11250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for the product. It's the most I'm willing to go.",10000.0,Bob,6,
