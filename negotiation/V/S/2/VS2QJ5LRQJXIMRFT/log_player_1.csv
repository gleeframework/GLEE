Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John. Therefore, her goal is to see if she can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a potential win-win:
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its perceived value to him.
    * Alice makes $150,000 more than selling to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite a counter-offer from Bob, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
