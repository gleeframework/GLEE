"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite ready to meet that price. Would you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your latest one. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I'm not comfortable going any lower. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,7,
