Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $105? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit away from a price I'm really happy with. Let's try one more counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $95 just yet. How about we try $102? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $102 is a decent price, saving $18 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept."
