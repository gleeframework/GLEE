Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so I need to offer a price that's attractive but leaves me with a good profit margin.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives me leverage. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a price slightly higher than $145."
