"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within budget, but I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, and $990000 is definitely getting closer.  However,  I'm still a bit over budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $975000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but I'm not going any lower. This is already a concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,7,
