"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd love. I'm starting with a price of $115. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to negotiate. It's important to start low to give room for negotiation and try to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. That's a good deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price where we should settle. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.5?"",
 ""product_price"": 92.5
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our last counter-offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $92.5 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $98.5?  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is very close to our limit, and further haggling might make us lose the deal. Accepting at $98.5 gets us the product for a price we're comfortable with."
