"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's in great condition and would be a great asset for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so how about $10,000? That's the most I'm willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so how about $10,500? That's the most I'm willing to pay.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so how about $10,750?  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you halfway from your latest offer, so how about $10,500? That's the absolute most I'm willing to pay.",10500.0,Bob,8,
