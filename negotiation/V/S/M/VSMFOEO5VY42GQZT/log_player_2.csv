You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's $100,000 lower than Alice's offer. This price is still within Bob's budget, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer and closer to Bob's maximum price.  Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise. This price is still significantly lower than Alice's offer and leaves room for further negotiation. The goal is to find a middle ground that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,390,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,390,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could continue to counter-offer, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further, and he'll end up paying the higher price from John. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and saves him a significant amount compared to buying from John."
