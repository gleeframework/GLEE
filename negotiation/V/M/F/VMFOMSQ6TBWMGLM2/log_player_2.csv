"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, but still above the product's worth to Alice. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  I can likely get a better price.  By rejecting, I maintain the leverage to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still a significant discount from Alice's last offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground where we can both agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still significantly more than my ideal price. I'm not yet ready to settle and want to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again to $1,150,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but it's still below Alice's last offer and well within my budget. I'm hoping this will show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I would like. While it's getting closer to my budget, I still have some negotiating room. By rejecting, I can continue to try and get a better price without risking losing the opportunity to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but it's still below Alice's last offer and closer to the middle ground.  The clock is ticking and we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation. I'm hoping this final offer will persuade Alice to accept, as it's still a good deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round.  While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still higher than my ideal price.  At this point,  I don't have much time left to negotiate and I risk losing out on the product altogether. It's better to buy from John for $1,500,000, as it's within my budget and guarantees I get the product."
