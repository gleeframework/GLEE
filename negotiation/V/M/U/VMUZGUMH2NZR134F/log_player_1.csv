Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is too low, and I'm confident we can reach a better price.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm not ready to give up yet."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. With 6 rounds left, I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We're running out of time and Bob seems unwilling to budge.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking a lower price or getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation. I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
