"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum value ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to create a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully entice Bob into considering my offer. 
* **First round strategy:** This first round is about gauging Bob's interest and potentially setting the stage for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?  I'm really interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is below my minimum price of $100.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is interested, I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  I will counteroffer in the next round to test if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  $85 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $95 is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above minimum:**  This price remains above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair price"" for both of us to create a sense of win-win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go to $90.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject his offer, I risk him walking away, leaving me with only John's offer of $100. 
* **Time is running out:**  We are already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale entirely. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
