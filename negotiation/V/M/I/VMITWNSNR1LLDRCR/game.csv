"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work. Let's find a compromise that's fair for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. Can we consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget.  How about we split the difference at $14,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you considering the product's worth.",14500.0,Alice,5,
