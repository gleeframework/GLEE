Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  While your initial offer is below what I can consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for both of us. To move things forward, I propose a price of $1,100,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement and your willingness to move on the price.  To be transparent, this product offers significant untapped potential that I believe you haven't fully factored into your valuation.  It's truly unique in the market. To reflect its true worth and to meet you halfway, I'm proposing $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair and reasonable offer considering the long-term value this product represents. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly lowering her price, we are still significantly above our absolute limit of $800,000. We've made good progress in the negotiation, but it's unlikely Alice will come down to a price that works for us within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price."
