I'm starting high, at $1 million.  This is a strong opening position, as it leaves room for negotiation while also emphasizing the value of the product to me. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much, and I'm willing to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my target. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a significant profit margin for me. It's also a strong position, as it's closer to my initial asking price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my ideal price.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's a significant profit and I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with John's offer of $800,000.  It's time to close the deal."
