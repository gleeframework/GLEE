"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I've been flexible, but I need to be honest, your current offer is not acceptable.  I'm willing to accept $1,350,000. However, I also have other interested buyers.  If we can't agree on this price, I may need to explore those options.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
