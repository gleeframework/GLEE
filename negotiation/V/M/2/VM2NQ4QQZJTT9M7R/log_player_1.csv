Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6

{

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, but we're still significantly above John's offer.  We need to signal we're willing to walk away if we don't get a price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible, but I need to be honest, your current offer is not acceptable.  I'm willing to accept $1,350,000. However, I also have other interested buyers.  If we can't agree on this price, I may need to explore those options."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding firm at a price above John's offer ($1,350,000). This is a strong signal to Bob that we have a viable alternative. 
* **Introducing Urgency:**  By mentioning other buyers, we're creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a more competitive offer to secure the deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While firm, the $1,350,000 leaves a small amount of room for Bob to counter if he's genuinely interested."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have other interested buyers, but I'm still interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is a reasonable profit above John's standing offer of $1,200,000.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob stating this is his final offer suggests he's unlikely to go significantly higher.  
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, there's a risk Bob walks away, and we'd end up with the $1,200,000 from John anyway.  It's better to secure the deal now with a decent profit."
