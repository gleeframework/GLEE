Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've set. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1250000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds to work with and can potentially get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to explore further negotiation and potentially get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but only to $1,600,000. This price still leaves me with a good profit, and it's fair considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. While $1600000 is closer to what I'm willing to pay, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1450000. I hope this suggestion is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still not quite there.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, I can continue to push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,525,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement here.  I'm confident that this price will be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1525000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. My latest proposal of $1450000 was based on my budgetary constraints. I would like to revisit this and suggest a counteroffer of $1475000. I believe this is a fair price for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,500,000. We are in Round 6, and I have only four rounds left to negotiate.  I am running out of time to get a better deal. It's more advantageous to accept John's offer and guarantee the $1,500,000 sale. This is the best outcome given the current negotiation situation and the limited time remaining."
