Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  This leaves room for negotiation without jeopardizing your minimum desired price.
* **It's appealing to Bob:**  The price is still below what the product is worth to him, making it a potentially attractive deal. 
* **It allows for flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, you can counter-offer or move on to John."
