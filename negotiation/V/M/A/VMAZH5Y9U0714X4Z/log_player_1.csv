Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort you've put into valuing our needs. However, I believe we can reach a more equitable solution. How about we consider the product priced at $1,350,000? This still allows for a reasonable profit margin for you while staying within my budget.
