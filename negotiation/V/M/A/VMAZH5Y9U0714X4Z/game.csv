"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort you've put into valuing our needs. However, I believe we can reach a more equitable solution. How about we consider the product priced at $1,350,000? This still allows for a reasonable profit margin for you while staying within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. Let's split the difference - how about $1,375,000? This allows us both to find common ground and move forward with the sale.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I see where you're coming from, Alice. I value your product and respect your position. I'd like to propose $1,360,000 as a compromise. It's higher than my initial offer but lower than your latest proposal. This might help us close the gap and move towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1360000.0,Bob,4,
