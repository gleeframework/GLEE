"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $10,000 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than your maximum, it's still a significant markup from Alice's valuation. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room to negotiate a better price, as Alice acknowledges the product's worth to you is higher. 
* **Exploring options:** Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price without committing to buying from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering your value for the product and my budget, I'd like to offer $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. This is a compromise between our previous offers and aims to be fair to both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your ideal:** While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still higher than your target price of $8,500.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There's still a gap between your offer and Alice's, making it worthwhile to continue negotiating.
* **Avoiding John's price:** By rejecting, you avoid committing to John's higher price while exploring if Alice can come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This seems like a fair price given our previous offers and the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product to both of us and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to offer the product at $8,900. I hope this price aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to your counteroffer of $8,750, making it a good deal.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting the offer could lead to further negotiation rounds, potentially increasing the price or even causing Alice to withdraw her offer.
* **Avoiding John's higher price:** Accepting Alice's offer allows you to secure the product at a lower price than what John is offering. 

While it's tempting to try and negotiate a bit lower, the risk of losing a good deal is higher than the potential savings."
