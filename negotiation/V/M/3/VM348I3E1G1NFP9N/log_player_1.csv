{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a steal for something worth so much to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It demonstrates that I understand the value of the product to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation if he's willing to pay more. I'm also prepared to walk away if he's not willing to meet my price, as I have another buyer lined up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price higher than his offer but lower than my initial price, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both room to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything significantly below $900,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price, but still a bit higher than Bob's offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 still feels a bit low.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This price is fair considering the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $875,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $862,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm not willing to risk losing a significant amount of money for a few thousand dollars. John is offering me a guaranteed $1,000,000, so it's the best decision in this scenario."
