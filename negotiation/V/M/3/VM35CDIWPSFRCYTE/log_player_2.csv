"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is still quite high, considering your maximum budget is $1,200,000 and the product is only worth $800,000 to her.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."

Considering the risk of losing the deal entirely, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. You still save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and it avoids the risk of a counteroffer that could be worse."
