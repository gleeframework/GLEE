"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above your budget of $12,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  You can always go with John's offer if negotiations with Alice fail."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $18,000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $13000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway and offering the product to you for $16000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your desired price. You can always fall back on John's offer if you can't reach an agreement."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible!  I'm still a bit above my budget at $16,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $14,000? That's a good middle ground for us both, and I'm really hoping to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I can offer the product to you for $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above your budget of $12,000.  While it's closer to your desired price, you've already made several counteroffers and it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult.  To avoid the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially wasting more time, it's best to secure the product from John for $12,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and minimizes the potential for further price increases."
