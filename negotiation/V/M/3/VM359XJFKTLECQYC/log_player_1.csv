Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below what I'd get from John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering Bob a price that's still above his initial offer, but closer to my minimum price, hoping to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm confident that John will buy it for $100, so I'll stop negotiating with Bob and go with the sure thing."
