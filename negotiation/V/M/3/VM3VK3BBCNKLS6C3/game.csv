"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that you're looking for a better price. However, I have to consider the value that the product holds for me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1150000.  This is a fair compromise that takes into account the value of the product and my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1300000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to see some movement from your side as well.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1300000 is getting closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to offer $1200000, and I'm confident that this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1350000, but I need to be clear that this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1350000 is still outside of my comfort zone. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to offer $1250000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and is the highest price I'm able to offer at this time. I'm confident this price is fair considering the value of the product and the market.  Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm running out of room to move. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, but I need to prioritize my own interests.",1400000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and the need to finalize this deal.  However, $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  To show my commitment to this transaction and avoid having to seek another seller, I'm willing to offer my final price of $1300000.  This is the absolute best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within my budget. If this price isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,10,
