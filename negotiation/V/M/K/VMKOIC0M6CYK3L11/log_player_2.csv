"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations at $90. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still too high for Bob. Since Bob's maximum budget is $100, he should try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, my budget is limited to $100. I'd be willing to buy it for $85. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your budget and the value you place on the product, I'm happy to counter with an offer of $95. This is a bit higher than my initial proposal, aiming to find a fair middle ground. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is within Bob's budget and a reasonable compromise. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal or wasting valuable time. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
