Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested, but I can only afford to pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. This still gives me a fair margin, and I think it's a good price for such a great product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's time to accept his offer and close the deal."
