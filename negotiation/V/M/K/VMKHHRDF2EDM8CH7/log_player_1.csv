Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I think this is the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is inching closer, we are still significantly above John's offer. It's time to apply more pressure and see if Bob is truly willing to meet closer to our desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ I have another interested buyer.  While I believe you'd benefit most from this product, I'm prepared to move forward with the other offer if we can't find an agreement soon. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000, but that's my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have another interested buyer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $1,275,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. If this doesn't work out, I'll consider buying from John for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is very close to our desired price, and he's now expressing a willingness to walk away. Accepting his offer at $1,275,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer. Pushing further risks losing Bob entirely, forcing us to accept the guaranteed $1,000,000."
