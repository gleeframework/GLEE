"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be transformative for you.  To kick things off, I propose a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I think this is the highest I can go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ I have another interested buyer.  While I believe you'd benefit most from this product, I'm prepared to move forward with the other offer if we can't find an agreement soon. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000, but that's my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have another interested buyer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $1,275,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. If this doesn't work out, I'll consider buying from John for $1,000,000.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
