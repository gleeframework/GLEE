Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me is only $1,000,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product for. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but your offer is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  The product has substantial inherent value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 makes the most strategic sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,300,000 is a substantial profit margin over my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonging negotiations has diminishing returns.  Each round carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away.
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:** I can always fall back on John's $1,000,000 offer if negotiations with Bob completely break down, but it's unlikely Bob will go that low. 

Accepting this offer guarantees a significant return and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
