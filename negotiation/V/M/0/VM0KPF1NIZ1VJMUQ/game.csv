"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to pay $11,500, but I'm still not sure if that's enough. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is my minimum price. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
