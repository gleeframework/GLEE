"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little too high for me.  Would you consider $12,500? That would be a good compromise, and I'm really serious about buying this product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm thinking of a price of $13,200. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
