"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still slightly above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get the price down to your limit of $12,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm thinking of a price of $13,200. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,200 is still above my budget.  While it's closer than her initial offer, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $12,000, which is within my budget and saves me money."
