{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($20,000) compared to your maximum budget of $8,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,500 is tempting, I'm still above my budget and have a few more rounds to try and get a better deal.  There's a chance that Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she's already rejected my counteroffer twice in a row."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer once more, showing a continued willingness to negotiate. At $13,000, I'm still under Alice's last offer but getting closer to my ideal price.  With only a few rounds left, I need to balance finding a good price with the possibility of needing to buy from John as a backup."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round left, and Alice's offer still being significantly above my budget, it's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  At $8,000, I'm guaranteed to get the product within my budget. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept my next offer, and it's not worth the risk of ending up with no product at all."
