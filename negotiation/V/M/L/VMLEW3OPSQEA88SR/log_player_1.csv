Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value."

``` 

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While he's moving closer to my minimum, $775,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to ensure I get a price that's closer to the value of the product."

Bob's offer of $800,000 finally meets my minimum price. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to go with John's offer, which is the same amount.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum goal."
