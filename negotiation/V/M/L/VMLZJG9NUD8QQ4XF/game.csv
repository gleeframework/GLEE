"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $95 for it. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $105. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $105 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
