"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $760,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to make a significant move, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, this is a fair deal, and I'm ready to close on it. However, I need you to come down just a bit more to make it work on my end. Would you consider $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to make it work on your end, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make, and I hope you'll consider it.",790000.0,Alice,7,
