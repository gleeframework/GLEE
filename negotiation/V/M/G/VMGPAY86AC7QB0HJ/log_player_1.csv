"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage further negotiation.  $1,350,000 is still above my minimum threshold, but it's a good middle ground to explore with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, I also want to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll continue negotiating in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good opportunity to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at the lower end of my desired range, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Given that we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, I think it's wise to accept his offer and secure the sale.  I'm not certain if I can get a better price, and the risk of a counteroffer getting rejected is high."
