"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you than that.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. While $13,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm able to spend. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",12000.0,Bob,4,
