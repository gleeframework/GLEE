Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward if Bob counters.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000, so there's no pressure to go below that.

By offering the product at $14,500, Alice aims to:

1. **Secure a quick sale:** The price is attractive compared to her minimum and might entice Bob.
2. **Potentially earn more than John's offer:** If Bob accepts, Alice makes $14,500 instead of $15,000.

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can always fall back on selling to John at her desired minimum."
