"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. Would you be willing to consider $10000? This is my best offer, and I'd be happy to close the deal today if it works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10000 is a bit low considering the value it holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $11000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase today.",11000.0,Bob,4,
