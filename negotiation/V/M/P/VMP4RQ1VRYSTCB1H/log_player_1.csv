Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** This offer assumes Bob is somewhat open to negotiation. If Alice knows Bob is a very tough negotiator, she might start slightly lower.
* **Relationship Importance:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is crucial, Alice might propose a slightly more generous price to build goodwill."
