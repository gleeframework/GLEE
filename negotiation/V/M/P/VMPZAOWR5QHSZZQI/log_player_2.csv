"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you value highly.  I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can save money by rejecting it. You know John will sell you the product for $15,000, and you're willing to pay that much. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer."
