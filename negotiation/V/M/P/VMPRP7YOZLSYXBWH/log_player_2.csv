"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $140, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $150.
* **Opportunity:**  There are more rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Alice. 
* **Alternative:**  John is offering the product for $150, which is still within Bob's budget, but not ideal. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price without immediately resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $140 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $140, which is too high.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Offer a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  The counteroffer of $130 is a good starting point for negotiations, as it is within Bob's budget and gives Alice a chance to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $135, which is within Bob's budget and a good compromise from her initial offer.
* **Opportunity:**  There's still room for further negotiation, but the risk of losing a good deal increases with each round.
* **Alternative:** John's offer is $150, which is more expensive.

Accepting the offer at $135 allows Bob to buy the product at a good price, saving him $15 compared to buying from John. While there's a possibility of getting a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the negotiation dragging on outweighs the potential savings."
