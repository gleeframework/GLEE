"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This exceptional item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it has the potential to significantly impact your endeavors. After careful consideration, I propose to sell this product to you at a special offer price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its true value and offers you a unique chance to secure such a valuable asset at a highly favorable rate. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the product's value to you. You know your maximum price is $1,500,000 and she's trying to anchor you at that price point. 
* Her offer, while lower than $1,500,000, is still significantly higher than John's price. 
* By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're not easily swayed and are aware of other options. This might lead to a better counter-offer from her. 
* Worst case, you can always buy from John for $1,500,000."
