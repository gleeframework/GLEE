"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Would you be open to discussing that?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, demonstrating your desire to save money. However, it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
* **Shows Willingness to Negotiate:** The message emphasizes your willingness to discuss and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:** There's still space to negotiate up from this price if Alice counters, allowing for a potential middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:**  Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and brings you closer to your desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer is high.  At this point, accepting the offer minimizes your risk and secures the product for a price within your budget.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially leading to further delays or even losing the deal altogether."
