"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to her valuation than yours. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, that price is a little high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  Starting with a low offer of $6,000 aims to anchor the negotiation in our favor. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it gives us significant room to move upwards. 
* **Polite and Respectful:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation. We want to reach a mutually agreeable outcome, not alienate Alice. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer signals that we're serious buyers but also value-conscious. It will prompt Alice to reconsider her position and hopefully counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable selling it to you for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering its value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your walk-away price. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as you can buy from John for the same price. Accepting now guarantees you the product at the desired price."
