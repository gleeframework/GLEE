Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $105 is my final offer. If you're still not interested, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $105, and her language suggests this is her final offer. Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes more sense to do that and save the extra $5."
