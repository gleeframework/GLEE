Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $110 gives Bob the impression of a discount while leaving you room to potentially negotiate down slightly if he hesitates. This still ensures you make a profit above your minimum.
* **Avoid Overpricing:**  Offering it at a price much higher than $110 is risky.  Bob only values the product at $80, so a significantly higher price will likely lead to an immediate rejection, forcing you to settle for $120 from John."
