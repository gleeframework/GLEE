"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit too far from my target. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
