"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it allows for potential negotiation. It's important to set a high initial price to see if Bob is truly interested and what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price than that. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I still have 9 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price to $12,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. It demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $11,000. This is a significant improvement from his initial offer of $10,000 and is getting closer to my desired price range.  With only 6 rounds remaining, I want to avoid risking losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and allows me to move on."
