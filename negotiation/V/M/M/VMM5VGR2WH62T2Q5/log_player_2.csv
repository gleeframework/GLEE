"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget.  You can try to negotiate further with her, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  If you can't reach a better deal, you can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1400000, which is $1300000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than your desired price. While you could continue negotiating, you've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like Alice might not be willing to go lower. It's better to go with John's offer of $1,000,000 to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
