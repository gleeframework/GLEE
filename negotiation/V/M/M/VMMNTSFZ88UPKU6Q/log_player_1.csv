Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, considering Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than my initial offer. I believe there's room to push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering with $975,000. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $960,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer or walking away entirely is increasing.  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss, so I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the deal."
