"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  You know the product is worth less to her, so there's room for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would allow us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.

While $900,000 is a better price than the initial offer, it's still more than you'd like to pay. It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can close the gap further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go down to $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is a good price considering your goal is to save as much money as possible. It's still cheaper than buying from John, and you've managed to negotiate a significant discount from Alice's initial offer."
