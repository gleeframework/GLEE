Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would allow us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.
