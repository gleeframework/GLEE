"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I recognize the value of this product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would allow us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go down to $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
