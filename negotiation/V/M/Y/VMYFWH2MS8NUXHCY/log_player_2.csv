"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's worth negotiating further to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal, and $95 is a reasonable starting point for his counteroffer. It's lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also close to Bob's maximum price of $100, so he's not taking a huge risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is now within Bob's budget and only $5 more than what he could buy it for from John.  It's not ideal, but it's a reasonable compromise. Further negotiation may take more time and effort without guaranteeing a better price, so it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and move on."
