Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he might get a deal.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than Bob's perceived worth by mentioning ""unique value.""
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signals to Bob that you are open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure the highest possible price from Bob.** If he accepts the $12,000, you've maximized your profit.
2. **Leave room for negotiation** while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 

Remember, you have a strong fallback option with John, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below your $10,000 valuation."
