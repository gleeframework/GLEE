"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $825,000 for the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $825,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $760,000? This would be a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so my counteroffer is $795,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could make a decision.",795000.0,Alice,5,
