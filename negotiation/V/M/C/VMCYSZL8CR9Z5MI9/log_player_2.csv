"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me and leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
