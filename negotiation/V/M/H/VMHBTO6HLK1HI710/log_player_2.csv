"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $850,000 is a good starting point, as it's still above Alice's minimum value but leaves room for further negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for improvement. Bob should aim for a price closer to $850,000.  There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob can continue to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting a lower price. Offering $860,000 is a compromise, showing Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway but still aiming for a good deal. This counteroffer is a reasonable step toward closing the deal without going too low too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob wants to save as much as possible, he's now only $10,000 away from his last offer.  There's a risk of going back and forth with Alice and not getting a better deal. It's safer to accept Alice's offer now and secure the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's.  There are still 5 rounds left if needed, but this is a good deal for Bob."
