"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know it's worth that much to you.  Let me know if you're interested! If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at the maximum you're willing to pay. There's no room for negotiation in her offer, and she's even implying she has other buyers.  Rejecting her offer might make her reconsider and propose a lower price. At worst, you can always buy from John for the same price."
