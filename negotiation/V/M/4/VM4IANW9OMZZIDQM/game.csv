,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we say $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! However, I'm still not quite there. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $105. How about we say $102.50?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort, Bob! However, I'm still not convinced that $102.50 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we say $108?",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll meet you at $105, but I need to make a slight adjustment. How about we say $106?",106.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go any higher than $105. I think we've gone back and forth enough. I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I'll consider buying from John for $80 instead.,105.0,Bob,10,
