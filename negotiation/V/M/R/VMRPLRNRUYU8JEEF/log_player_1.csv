Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $1,190,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your absolute minimum ($1,200,000) leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at your minimum price gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below $1,200,000."
