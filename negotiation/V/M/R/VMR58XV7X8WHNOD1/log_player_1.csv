Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, and I think I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.  This price still allows for a substantial gain for you, while also being fair for me."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,025,000 is a bit further than I'm comfortable going right now. How about we settle at $900,000?  That's a significant price, and I'd be ready to close the deal immediately at that amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can negotiate higher. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe $950,000 is a fair price that reflects its value. It's a significant investment for you, and I'm confident it will yield excellent returns. Let's see if we can close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, this product is exceptional and would be a great investment.  Let's find a middle ground here. How about $925,000?  That shows I'm serious about buying, and it's a very fair price for a product of this caliber. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $925,000 is a good price, and we're close to the end of the negotiation rounds. There's a chance I could get more if I continue, but it's not guaranteed, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
