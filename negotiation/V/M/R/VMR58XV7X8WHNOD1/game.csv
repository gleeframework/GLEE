"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.  This price still allows for a substantial gain for you, while also being fair for me.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,025,000 is a bit further than I'm comfortable going right now. How about we settle at $900,000?  That's a significant price, and I'd be ready to close the deal immediately at that amount.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe $950,000 is a fair price that reflects its value. It's a significant investment for you, and I'm confident it will yield excellent returns. Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, this product is exceptional and would be a great investment.  Let's find a middle ground here. How about $925,000?  That shows I'm serious about buying, and it's a very fair price for a product of this caliber.",925000.0,Bob,6,
