"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation.  I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product,  $1,100,000 is higher than I'm currently able to pay. I'm prepared to offer $850,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I will reject her offer and try to get a lower price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're committed to getting a good price for the product.  However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a substantial difference from what I had in mind. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $975,000 is still above my budget. While it shows a willingness to compromise, it's getting too close to my maximum.  It's better to buy from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation. I can save a significant amount of money this way."
