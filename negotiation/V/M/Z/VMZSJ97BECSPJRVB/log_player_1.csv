Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product,  $1,100,000 is higher than I'm currently able to pay. I'm prepared to offer $850,000. This represents a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
