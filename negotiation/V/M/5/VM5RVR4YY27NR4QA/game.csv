"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a good profit, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  My absolute best offer is $750,000. If you can't do that, I understand, but I might have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is your absolute best offer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think I've gone as low as I can. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
