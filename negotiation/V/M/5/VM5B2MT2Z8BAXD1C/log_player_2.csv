{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for improvement."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to come down closer to my ideal price. I'm hoping to make her see that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still a significant amount. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better price. There's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still below her latest offer, indicating that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  I'm aiming for a middle ground between our last offers."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down significantly in price, and $875,000 is a very reasonable price.  Continuing to negotiate might save me a little, but the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and me ending up buying from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  This is a good deal."
