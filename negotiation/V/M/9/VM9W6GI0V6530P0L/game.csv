"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. Can we discuss the possibility of a compromise at this price?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still staying within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a more comfortable price for you, Bob, but I still need to get as much as I can for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final concession. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
