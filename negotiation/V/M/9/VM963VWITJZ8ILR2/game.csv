"Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. This price reflects the significant value and potential of this product.  I'm confident it will be a sound investment for you. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm prepared to accept $1200000 for the product.  This still reflects its potential value, but it's a fair price that shows I'm willing to be flexible.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to be flexible, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
