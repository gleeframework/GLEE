Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still below my minimum value. I'll try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
