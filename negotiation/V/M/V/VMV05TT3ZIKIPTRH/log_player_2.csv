Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be realistic about my minimum acceptable price. $9,500 is simply not enough for me to part with the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering both our needs. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about what I can accept. $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.  I'm ready to close this deal, but if it doesn't work out, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $11,000 - $12,000 range. While she might come down slightly, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $10,000, especially with another potential buyer.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing out on John's guaranteed $10,000 offer."
