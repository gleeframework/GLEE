"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential benefit for Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  A $2,000 difference between my offer and Bob's valuation leaves space for negotiation without risking losing the deal immediately. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping John in mind as a potential backup buyer if the negotiation with Bob fails. This ensures I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $17,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I have 8 rounds left, and there's still room for a counteroffer that might be acceptable to both of us.
* **John as a Backup:** If negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $17,000 to $13,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making my offer seem reasonable.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with a positive statement to keep the negotiation open.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, I can always sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $9,500? It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time for a firmer stance:**  While Bob is showing a slight increase in his offer, I'm running out of time and need to be more assertive. 
* **John is a safe option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is still a viable option if negotiation fails. I'm not willing to risk settling for a price that's too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be realistic about my minimum acceptable price. $9,500 is simply not enough for me to part with the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering both our needs. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm standing my ground while still showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly implying a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **John is Waiting:**  I'm aware that John is a reliable alternative if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about $10,500? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to 4 rounds remaining, and time is running out.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a secure and profitable option. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer would be a significant loss for me, especially considering that I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about what I can accept. $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.  I'm ready to close this deal, but if it doesn't work out, I have another buyer lined up."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Fairness and Compromise:** I've lowered my price to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my minimum acceptable price.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm reminding Bob that I have another buyer, which increases the pressure to accept the offer. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to 3 rounds, so the time for negotiating is dwindling."
