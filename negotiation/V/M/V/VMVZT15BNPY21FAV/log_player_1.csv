Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a higher initial offer gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.  Since Bob values the product at $100, there's a chance he might accept a price higher than that if he perceives the product as beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $120 is closer to Bob's valuation, there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming to maximize your profit, and settling at this stage might leave money on the table. You'll counter with a price closer to your minimum while still encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above your minimum.
* **Strategic positioning:**  By countering with $135, you're signaling that you're serious about selling but not desperate. This keeps the door open for Bob to potentially offer a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $125 is a reasonable profit margin above your minimum price of $100. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could potentially squeeze out a few more dollars, there's also a chance Bob might walk away if you continue to negotiate. Accepting now secures a solid profit.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation further might not be worth the potential gain, especially with a guaranteed offer from John in hand."
