This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price:** $790,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Alice's Tone:** Alice seems firm in her ""final concession"". Pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** You only have a few rounds left. Waiting might not yield a significantly better price from Alice. 

While you might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more, the risk of Alice walking away and having to buy from John outweighs the potential reward."
