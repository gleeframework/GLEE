Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive and encouraging tone (""great deal"", ""very valuable"") may help Bob feel more inclined to negotiate.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard deadline or making it seem like this is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.  This encourages Bob to participate in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I hope to maximize my profit while still giving Bob the opportunity to get a good deal.  I'll be prepared to counter his offers if necessary, and if things stall, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $9000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:** While it's closer to my target than his initial perception of value, $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to get closer to my desired price point, particularly since Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Testing the waters:** Rejecting his offer allows me to see if Bob is truly serious about purchasing the product or if he is simply trying to lowball me.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I am not willing to settle for a price far below my minimum. This will hopefully encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round. If his next offer is still too low, I'll consider selling to John, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer of $11,000 moves significantly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the ""value"" of the product, reminding Bob of its worth and potentially swaying him to consider a higher price.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  I use language like ""fair price"" and ""good deal"" to create a sense of compromise and encourage Bob to see my offer as reasonable.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to test Bob's sincerity and willingness to negotiate further. If he accepts, I'll secure a good deal while still maintaining my bottom line. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter again or consider selling to John, but I want to see how far Bob is willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I can only consider offers up to $10000. I hope this meets your needs and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but still too low:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, but it's still $5,000 lower.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price.  He has already demonstrated a pattern of offering the minimum he's willing to pay.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John at $15,000 guarantees my desired profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, I've already made a significant concession.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of ending up with a lower price.  John offers a guaranteed profit that I'm not willing to risk losing."
