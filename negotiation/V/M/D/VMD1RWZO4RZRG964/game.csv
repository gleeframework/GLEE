"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering your asking price and my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This offer reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to benefit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still higher than my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is closer to the middle ground.  This reflects the product's value to me while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,
