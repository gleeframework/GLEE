"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth more than what others might be offering. We're confident it would significantly benefit your endeavors. Considering its true worth, we're proposing an offer of $1,350,000. We believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of our product and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value ($1,350,000 vs. $1,200,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible.** Buying from John is an option, but it's the most expensive.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.** This is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price than Alice's initial offer."
