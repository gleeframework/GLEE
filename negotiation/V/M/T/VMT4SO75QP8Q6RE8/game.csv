"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for your business. I'm willing to make one final concession to show my commitment to making this deal work. How about $1,450,000? This is my best and final offer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your commitment to making the deal work, but $1,450,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,300,000 is too low, I'll meet you halfway from $1,450,000 to $1,350,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
