"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm stance.
* **Justification:** I'm highlighting the product's ""incredible value and potential"" to justify the high initial price and potentially sway Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate while remaining confident in the product's value. 
* **Backup Plan (John):** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't prove fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll aim for a counteroffer that keeps the deal attractive to Bob while moving closer to my desired selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and expressing a willingness to compromise, fostering a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Concession:**  By reducing my price by $200,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still holding firm above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the ""true value"" to subtly anchor the price at a higher point.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Framing:** This common negotiation tactic can make the offer seem more appealing by suggesting fairness and encouraging reciprocity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting too close to my walk-away point. While he claims this is his maximum, there's still room for negotiation before I resort to selling to John. I'll counter with a price that's still above my minimum but signals a willingness to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for your business. I'm willing to make one final concession to show my commitment to making this deal work. How about $1,450,000? This is my best and final offer."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm conveying a sense of firmness by stating this is my ""final concession"" and ""best and final offer,"" which can encourage Bob to take the offer seriously.
* **Justification:** I'm again subtly emphasizing the value proposition to counter Bob's lowball offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,450,000 is just above my safety net with John, ensuring I maximize my potential profit while still leaving a small margin for negotiation if Bob attempts a final counter. 
* **Time Pressure:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm implicitly introducing time pressure, hoping Bob will recognize the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your commitment to making the deal work, but $1,450,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,300,000 is too low, I'll meet you halfway from $1,450,000 to $1,350,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his valuation and not showing significant movement. His latest offer of $1,350,000 is too close to my absolute minimum, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant increase. 

It's time to cut my losses. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a substantial profit without the risk of Bob walking away and leaving me with an even lower offer in later rounds."
