# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! This product is worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to give you a discount because I believe in the value of our partnership. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
