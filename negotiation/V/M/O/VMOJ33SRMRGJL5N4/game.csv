"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a way to make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to pay $1250000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
