"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase my product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm starting the negotiations with a price of $1800000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1500000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1650000, reflecting the unique value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
