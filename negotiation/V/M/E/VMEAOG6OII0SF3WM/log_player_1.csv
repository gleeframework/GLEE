You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's a significant profit over John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing negotiations has risks. Bob might lower his offer, or the deal could fall through, forcing me to accept John's lower price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital available for other investments or uses sooner."
