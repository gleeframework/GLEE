"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,275,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm going to need at least $1,200,000 to make this happen.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and my original offer of $900,000. Can we try $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to my original asking price to make this work.  Let's try $1,150,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're still trying to negotiate a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I've already come down significantly from my original asking price. Let's try $1,125,000. This is a final compromise on my part, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
