"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room for a lower price that still benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This price would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be a happy customer."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. While Bob initially aimed for $10,500,  accepting this offer saves him $3,500 compared to buying from John. It's a fair price for both parties, and Bob can secure the product at a decent price."
