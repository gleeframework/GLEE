"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $1000000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay at a price that makes sense for me. I'm now offering the product to you for $1075000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
