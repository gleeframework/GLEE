Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product but can't afford that price.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

However, my original offer reflects the true market value of this product and its potential for significant returns. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't drop the price to $850,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still significantly more than I can afford. I'm willing to go a little higher, but $1,100,000 is my absolute maximum. This reflects the value I see in the product and my ability to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob is now inching closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer to signal that while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate. Let's see if he's willing to go higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for staying with me in this negotiation. I appreciate you being upfront about your budget.  To bridge the gap, let's try $1,650,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the product's inherent value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,250,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part and is the absolute maximum I can afford.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, Bob's latest offer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds his initial offer by a significant margin and surpasses what I could get from John after considering potential risks and delays of finding another buyer. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit without jeopardizing the deal."
