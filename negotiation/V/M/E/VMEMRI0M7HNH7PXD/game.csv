"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product but can't afford that price.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, my original offer reflects the true market value of this product and its potential for significant returns. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't drop the price to $850,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still significantly more than I can afford. I'm willing to go a little higher, but $1,100,000 is my absolute maximum. This reflects the value I see in the product and my ability to pay.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for staying with me in this negotiation. I appreciate you being upfront about your budget.  To bridge the gap, let's try $1,650,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the product's inherent value.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,250,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part and is the absolute maximum I can afford.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
