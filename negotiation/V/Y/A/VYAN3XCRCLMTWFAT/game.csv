"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price. After re-evaluating, I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $9,800. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value and quality, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $9,800 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. After re-evaluating, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $9,700. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9700.0,Alice,7,
