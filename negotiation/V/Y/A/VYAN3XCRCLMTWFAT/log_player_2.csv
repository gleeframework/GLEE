"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $8,000. It's too early to buy from John, as you have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and hopefully get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $12,000, it's still above your budget.  You have 7 rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth continuing to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price. After re-evaluating, I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $9,800. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value and quality, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your $8,000 limit.  You have 5 rounds left and you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer will give you more leverage to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $9,800 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. After re-evaluating, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $9,700. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,700 is still above your budget of $8,000.  You only have 3 rounds left, and the negotiation is starting to stall. It's becoming more likely that you won't be able to get Alice down to your desired price point.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John, who is offering a guaranteed price within your budget."
