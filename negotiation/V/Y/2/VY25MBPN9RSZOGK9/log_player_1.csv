Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it leaves some room for further negotiation if needed.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that my initial offer was reasonable and that $175 is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price and a fair price considering the negotiation. I'll accept his offer."
