"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential,"" subtly suggesting the price is justified without explicitly stating why. 
* **Strategy:** This high initial offer aims to:
    *  Anchor the negotiation at a higher point.
    *  Gather information about Bob's willingness to pay.
    *  Leave room for strategic concessions later in the negotiation. 

This approach keeps the John option open while maximizing potential profit with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That starting price is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $600,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  It's too early to sell to John, as there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I'll counter-offer in Round 3 to guide the negotiation towards a more acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and a strong ROI.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** While I'm lowering my price considerably, it's still substantially above both my minimum and Bob's offer. This signals flexibility but maintains a strong position.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition (""unique advantages,"" ""strong ROI"") to justify the price and shift focus away from Bob's low anchor.
* **Guiding the Negotiation:** By making a large concession, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer, moving us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.

This strategy aims to extract as much value as possible from Bob before considering alternative options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond my budget.  To be realistic, I can't go higher than $750,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  While Bob increased his offer slightly, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. At this rate, reaching a mutually beneficial agreement seems unlikely within the remaining rounds. 
* **John Option Attractive:** The gap between Bob's offer and John's guaranteed $1,500,000 is substantial. Continuing with Bob carries the risk of not reaching a deal at all.
* **Strategic Timing:** It's better to switch to John now rather than later, as further negotiation with Bob might not yield significant improvements. 

Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer and selling to John is the most logical choice at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions remains significant. I've carefully evaluated the situation, and to be transparent, I've received another offer closer to my asking price. I'm still open to working with you, but I need to see a substantial increase to continue our discussion. Would you be willing to consider an offer in the range of $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure and Urgency:**  By mentioning another offer, I'm introducing a sense of competition and urgency for Bob to make a serious move.
* **Justified Concession:** I'm making another significant concession, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Conditional Continuation:** I'm making it clear that continuing with Bob depends on his willingness to significantly increase his offer.  This sets a clear expectation for the next round.

This strategy aims to either secure a much better offer from Bob or prompt him to walk away, allowing me to proceed with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,300,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. If you're willing to meet somewhere closer to the middle, I'm open to continuing the conversation. My best offer would be $800,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering your other options and the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has explicitly stated that $800,000 is his ""best and final offer."" This leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **Unacceptable Price:** Even though Bob has reached his perceived value, $800,000 is still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is guaranteed and represents a $700,000 difference. Continuing with Bob holds no benefit and risks losing the guaranteed sale.

Bob's final offer doesn't justify further negotiation. Accepting John's offer ensures the best outcome in this scenario."
