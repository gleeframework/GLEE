Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  Would you be willing to do $100? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm and unlikely to go much lower than $100. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk she won't budge and you'll waste valuable rounds.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $80, which meets your budget."
