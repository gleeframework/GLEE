Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, it's always best to aim slightly higher to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,999 is a very tempting price point. It's just below my guaranteed sale price but significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and a potential ""deal"" for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message doesn't close the door to further discussion. If Bob counters, I have room to negotiate down slightly while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
