Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $8,000.  This gives me a starting point for negotiation.
* **Aiming High:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with an offer above Bob's valuation.
* **Firmness:** By stating it's a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer, I signal I'm not willing to negotiate much further, putting pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to be bolder in my initial offer to Bob."
