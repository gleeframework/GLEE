"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $12,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
