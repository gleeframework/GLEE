"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties and I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I can offer it to you for $1800000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I need to consider other opportunities as well.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1600000. I can meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll counter with $1700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1650000 is the right price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with $1750000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,7,
