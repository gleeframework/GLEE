"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think it's a great deal and would be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $100, and her offer is $95. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  The message is friendly and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating your position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  You are willing to pay a maximum of $100, and she is offering $90. There is still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price.  You'll continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $85 and Alice's offer of $90. It shows you're willing to negotiate, but you're still standing your ground.  The message remains friendly and emphasizes finding a middle ground."
