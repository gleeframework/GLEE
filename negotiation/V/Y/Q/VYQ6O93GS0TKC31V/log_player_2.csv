(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is only worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $130. This is a bad deal.
* You have the option to buy from John for $100, which is a better price. 
* However, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product, and this is your first counteroffer.
* You are starting with the price you are willing to pay, making it clear you are serious about getting a good deal. 
* This sets the stage for further negotiation."

* There are still rounds left, so you have time to continue negotiating with Alice. Rejecting her offer gives you another chance to make a counteroffer."

{""product_price"": 110}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. 
* You still have the option to buy from John for $100, which is a better deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still too high. While it's getting closer to your desired price, you only have a few rounds left. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, which is a much better deal than Alice's offer.
