"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's in my best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a good margin for you. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for a good margin for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $1,200,000. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get the price down further.  I'm not desperate, and I have the option to buy from John if I can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and gives you a decent profit. I'm confident we can come to an agreement if we both make a little effort."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000 yet. I'm willing to offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1,250,000? This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident we can get a deal done at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my maximum budget. It's tempting to accept because it's very close, but I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get that last bit down to $1,200,000.  I'm only one round away from being able to buy from John for the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  Let's finalize this deal at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that ensures both of us get a good outcome.  This is my final offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $1,200,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept it yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,220,000? This is my last offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,220,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Although we've gotten very close to an agreement, I'm now down to my last two rounds.  At this point, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation to try to get a lower price. I'm better off purchasing from John for $1,200,000 and ensuring I get the product at my target price."
