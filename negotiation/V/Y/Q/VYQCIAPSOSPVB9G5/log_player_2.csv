"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110, which is more than Bob is willing to pay.
* **John's offer:** $120, which is Bob's maximum price.

Since Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum price, it makes sense to reject it and buy from John, even though John's price is higher than Alice's. This ensures Bob gets the product at the lowest possible price within his budget."
