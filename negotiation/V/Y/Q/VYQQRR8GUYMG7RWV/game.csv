"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  How about we split the difference at $13,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly aim for $13,000? This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,4,
