Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language and emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product.
* **Room for Counteroffers:** I'm leaving some space for Bob to counter-offer without immediately triggering my ""sell to John"" plan. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I can be more aggressive in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean I'm losing money.
* **Potential for Counter-Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, there's still room for negotiation. I can try to meet him halfway or propose a price closer to my desired value.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is ready to buy at $15,000 provides leverage. I can be more assertive in negotiation without being forced to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  How about we split the difference at $13,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him, suggesting he's getting a good deal even at $13,500.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and constructive tone to keep the negotiation open.
* **Remaining Firm:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving up on my desired profit margin. I'm confident that John's offer allows me to hold firm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly aim for $13,000? This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's within a reasonable range considering the potential for further negotiation.
* **Risk of Losing Bob:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk him walking away entirely.  There's no guarantee he'll come back with a better offer.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me some comfort.  If Bob changes his mind later, I can still go back to John.
* **Time Factor:**  Negotiating further could drag on, and I might lose valuable time.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and move on."
