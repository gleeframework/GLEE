{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit too steep for me, though. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than nothing, it's far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer!  $110 is a bit too low for me, though. I'm willing to come down to $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
