"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately.  This establishes a strong starting point for negotiations and allows me to see if Bob is truly interested.  I'm also aware of John's offer, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiations and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum by continuing negotiations. Also, selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a viable option, giving me the flexibility to walk away if the negotiations don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer before considering John's offer. I'm lowering the price to $1,550,000, which is only $50,000 below my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as I don't want to risk losing a deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it, and we are running out of time. John's offer of $1,500,000 is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
