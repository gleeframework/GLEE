Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's value leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Backup Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows Alice to aim higher with Bob.

This strategy aims for a win-win situation. Bob gets a product he values for a price slightly below his perceived worth, and Alice secures a substantial profit beyond her minimum acceptable price."
