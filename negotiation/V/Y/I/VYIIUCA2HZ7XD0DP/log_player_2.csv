"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my unique product for $1500000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I believe it holds great value for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's best to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I see the potential in your product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay at this time. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further.  Let's try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still out of my reach. I'm prepared to go up to $900,000, which represents a significant increase from my initial offer. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to make a reasonable deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still not enough.  Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $1,100,000. While that's a better price than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget.  At this point, it's more prudent to buy from John and save some money."
