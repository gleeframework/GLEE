"Alice, while I see the potential in your product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay at this time. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is still out of my reach. I'm prepared to go up to $900000, which represents a significant increase from my initial offer. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still not enough.  Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
