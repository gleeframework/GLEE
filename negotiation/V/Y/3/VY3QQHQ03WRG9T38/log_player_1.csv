Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I know you're interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still making the offer attractive to Bob. He saves $1,000 compared to his perceived value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wants a slightly lower price. 
* **Backup Offer:** You have the security of knowing John will buy the product for your minimum acceptable price if Bob declines."
