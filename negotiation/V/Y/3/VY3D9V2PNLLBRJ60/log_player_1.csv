Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $1,000) while maximizing your potential profit.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, as anything lower leaves potential profit on the table."
