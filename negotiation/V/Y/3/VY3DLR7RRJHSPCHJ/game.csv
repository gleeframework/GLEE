"Alice, your product is certainly impressive, but $1,450,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire to maximize your profit, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
