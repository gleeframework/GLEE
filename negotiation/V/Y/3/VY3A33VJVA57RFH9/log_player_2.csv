"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in paying $12,000 for it? This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a reasonable price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her stated value, you can get the product for $2,000 cheaper from John.  Your goal is to save money, and buying from John is the most financially advantageous option."
