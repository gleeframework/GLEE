"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the competitive price, I'm looking to spend closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $10750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10750. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11200 is still above my budget. To close this deal, I'm offering $10900. This is a fair compromise and I believe we can both walk away happy with this agreement.",10900.0,Bob,6,
