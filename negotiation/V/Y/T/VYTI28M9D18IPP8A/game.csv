"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, I'm not quite comfortable with that price point. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair price considering the immense value it offers.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
