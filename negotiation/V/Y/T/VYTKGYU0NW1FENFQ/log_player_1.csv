"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting high ($1,600,000) establishes a strong position and leaves room for negotiation. It signals that you value the product highly.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high price without revealing specific details about your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing the details further""  indicates willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, you're getting significantly more than your minimum.
2. **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** His response will reveal how interested he is and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  To start, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair and reasonable starting point given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his stated value for the product, leaving no room for negotiation on his end.  While we could sell to John right now for a profit, we're still early in the negotiation process. Rejecting Bob's offer gives us a chance to:

* **Demonstrate firmness:**  Show Bob we're serious about getting a price closer to our valuation.
* **Counter with a more reasonable (but still profitable) offer:** We can come down from our initial high offer while still aiming for a price above our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the value this product will bring."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge but Stand Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but reiterate that it's too low. 
* **Significant Reduction:** Coming down by $150,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate but keeps us significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Again, we subtly highlight the product's value to justify the price without revealing specific details.

This strategy aims to:

* **Encourage Bob to negotiate upwards:** By making a substantial reduction, we hope to encourage Bob to raise his offer considerably in the next round.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  We're still aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to push for more, here's why accepting is the best choice:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** We've secured a $200,000 profit, meeting our primary objective.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only seven rounds remaining, there's a risk that extended negotiations might not result in a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **John's Offer is Equal:** While we could go to John, he's offering the same price as Bob. There's no financial benefit to switching at this point.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a solid profit without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
