"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  To start, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair and reasonable starting point given its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the value this product will bring.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good value for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
