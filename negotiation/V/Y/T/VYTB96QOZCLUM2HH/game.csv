"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for this product. I believe it's a fair price, given the potential benefits you mentioned. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. This is a fair price, considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1025000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm comfortable with $1000000. This would allow us both to move forward with the sale and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits we've discussed. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1015000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,5,
