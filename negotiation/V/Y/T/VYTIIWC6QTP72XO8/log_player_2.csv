"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. This means you'll get no savings.
* You have a better option - John is willing to sell you the product for the same price.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can buy the product from John for the same price, which gives you the same value but doesn't leave any room for negotiation with Alice."
