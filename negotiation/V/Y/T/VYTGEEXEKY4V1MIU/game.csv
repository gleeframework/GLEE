"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value this product brings.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, $1,025,000 is getting closer, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's settle at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
