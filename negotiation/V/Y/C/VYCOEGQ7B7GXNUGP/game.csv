"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we value this product at $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a generous offer to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to make a counteroffer to you. I'll sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  Could we settle on $1,075,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
