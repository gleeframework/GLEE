"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10800, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $10800?",10800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $11200. How about we meet at $11200?",11200.0,Alice,5,

I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $10800. I've already stretched my budget to its limit. I'm starting to think I'll have to look elsewhere for a better deal. Can you meet me at $10800?,10800.0,Bob,6,
