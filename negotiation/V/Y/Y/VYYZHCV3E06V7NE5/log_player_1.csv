Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I still have 8 rounds left and think I can push for a higher price.  I want to see if Bob will increase his offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this price is reasonable considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still within my 10 rounds and believe I can get closer to $1,000,000.  It's worth seeing if I can push him just a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit below my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this price is a fair compromise that takes into account the value it brings and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, I've reached a point where the offers are getting very close to my minimum. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might get frustrated and walk away.  With John, I have a guaranteed deal for $1,000,000, which is my minimum. 

Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John to secure the best possible price."
