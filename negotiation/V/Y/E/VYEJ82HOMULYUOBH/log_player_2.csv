"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still above your desired maximum of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  I believe this product is valuable to me, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to charge at least $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I can consider. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still $100,000 above your budget. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will be unwilling to budge further, and you'll end up paying more than you want.  It's safer and more efficient to buy from John at your target price of $1,000,000."
