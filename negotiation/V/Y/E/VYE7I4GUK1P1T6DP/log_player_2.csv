"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly.  I can always buy from John for $100 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  That price is a bit too high for me though. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a much lower offer ($80) leaves room for negotiation while signaling I'm serious about buying at the right price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's completely unwilling to budge from the $150, I know I'm better off going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a little, but she's still significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from her side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $100? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm now offering my maximum price.  This tells Alice I'm serious but also sets a clear boundary. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning that this is my ""highest"" adds a bit of urgency, encouraging Alice to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Ready to Walk Away:** I'm prepared to buy from John if Alice doesn't accept this offer."
