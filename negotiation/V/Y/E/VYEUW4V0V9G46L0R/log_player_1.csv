"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob an incentive to counter, and it allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $11,000. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to move higher in the next round. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $12,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly better than selling to John and brings me closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I've gotten the best deal possible with Bob in the given circumstances."
