"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision, as I have another offer for $1,200,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate and has signaled she has a lower offer on the table. By rejecting her current offer, you incentivize her to propose the lower price of $1,200,000. This saves you a significant amount compared to both her current offer and buying from John."
