"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $700,000 is a good start, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $650,000. I know you value it at $800,000, so there's definitely room for us to find a price that works for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",675000.0,Alice,3,
