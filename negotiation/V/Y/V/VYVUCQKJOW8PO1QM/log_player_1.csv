Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate upwards if he counteroffers. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too high, making it more likely Bob will engage.

I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage and make him feel valued."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150.  I'm confident I can get a better price by counteroffering.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me right now, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105? Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but also holding firm to a price closer to my desired value.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly to encourage Bob to stay engaged.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer still gives me some room to come down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $95?  I'm really hoping to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I consider fair.  I'm not desperate for a sale, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the deal for Bob by mentioning it's ""great"" for him.
* **Final Stand:** $100 is a good middle ground, and a final offer before considering John.

This counteroffer aims to reach a compromise without jeopardizing my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit above what I can do.  I'm willing to go up to $97, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $97 is only $3 away from my minimum value of $100. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of going lower outweighs the potential gain. 
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further could take time and effort. It's more efficient to sell to John now for a guaranteed $150.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me a price I'm comfortable with, eliminating the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer.

Although I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, it's strategically better to take John's offer and secure a profit without further delays or uncertainties."
