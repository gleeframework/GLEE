Round 2

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1050000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that aligns with my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm proposing $1000000 for the product. This would allow us both to walk away happy with the deal.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,000,000 is a good deal. It's well above my minimum and secures a sale. I'm confident I can find a way to make up the difference elsewhere."
