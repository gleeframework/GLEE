"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your target price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to work towards a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:**  A $250,000 drop from Alice's offer is substantial and shows your seriousness in getting a lower price.
* **Profit for Alice:** $950,000 is still a $150,000 profit for Alice, indicating it's a fair counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high. There's room for further negotiation, and you have 7 rounds left. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue pushing for a better price, potentially getting closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that aligns with my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm proposing $1,000,000 for the product. This would allow us both to walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  A $50,000 reduction from Alice's offer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate but shows you're still serious about getting a better price.
* **Fair Compromise:** $1,000,000 is a good middle ground, potentially leaving both parties with a reasonable profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping a positive and collaborative tone helps maintain a good rapport with Alice during negotiations."
