"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is  too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $11,500? It's a fair price that lets us both walk away satisfied.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low.  My final offer is $12,500. This is a great price for a product of this quality.",12500.0,Alice,5,
