Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and Bob's offer is below that. It's better to try to negotiate further than to sell to John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
