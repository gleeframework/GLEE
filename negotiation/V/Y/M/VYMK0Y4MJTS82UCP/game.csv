"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
