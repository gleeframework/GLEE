Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're making a profit of $3,000, which is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob would still be getting a good deal, as the product is worth $12,000 to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth where you can potentially increase the price further.

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, you set the stage for a potentially lucrative deal with Bob."
