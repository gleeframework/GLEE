Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a significant discount for Bob but still above my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'm not desperate. 
* **Potential Counteroffers:** I'm anticipating Bob might counteroffer. My strategy is to be prepared to negotiate a bit lower, but not below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he's clearly interested.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $14,000 to $12,500, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Middle Ground:** This price is still above Bob's offer of $11,000, but closer to it. It's a more reasonable counteroffer that could potentially lead to a deal.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $12,500 is still above my minimum price of $15,000, so I'm not losing money by making this offer.
* **Keeping Negotiation Open:** If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit. If he rejects, we can continue negotiating, but I can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:** Bob has shown a reluctance to increase his offer. Further negotiation may only lead to more rejected offers, wasting time and potentially lowering my final price.
* **John's Offer is the Best Option:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's offer. It's a risk-free and profitable solution."
