{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price above my minimum, but also leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but still below my minimum selling price to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm aiming for a price that's a bit closer to my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this counteroffer."
