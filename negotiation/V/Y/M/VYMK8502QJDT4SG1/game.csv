"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm confident this product can generate much more value for you in the long run.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it to make sense on my end. Would you consider $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,315,000, but I really think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",1315000.0,Bob,6,
