"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my desired range. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good opportunity to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a substantial profit and  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure a good deal than to push for an even better one and potentially end up with nothing."
