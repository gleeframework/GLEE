"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value this product brings is substantial, and $750,000 significantly undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise and reflects the true worth of this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
