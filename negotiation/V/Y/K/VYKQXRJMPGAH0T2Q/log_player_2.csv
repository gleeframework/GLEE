"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to make it happen. I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John at $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or move on to John if necessary."
