"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit low for me.  How about $115?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my target price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price.",110.0,Bob,4,
