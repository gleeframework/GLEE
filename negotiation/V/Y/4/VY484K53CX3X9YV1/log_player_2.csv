"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than $13,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $12,000. Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000. A counteroffer of $12,500 is a reasonable starting point, splitting the difference between their valuations. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still above what Alice is willing to accept.  Bob should try to negotiate further to try to get a better price. There's still potential for a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's last counteroffer of $12,500 was rejected, indicating that Alice is willing to go a bit higher. This counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise, closer to Alice's last offer, while still saving Bob $500 compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still worth it for Bob to buy from Alice. Buying from Alice saves Bob $1,250 compared to buying from John.  While a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and a good deal."
