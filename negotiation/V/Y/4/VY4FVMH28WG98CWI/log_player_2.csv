"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [Product Name] for a price that is significantly less than its value to you. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is being a bit vague and sales-y in her message, her offer of $1,150,000 is still $50,000 cheaper than buying from John.  It makes the most financial sense to accept her offer."
