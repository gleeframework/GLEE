"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product definitely seems interesting, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be possible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down to $750,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
