{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, making him more likely to consider it. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I'm leaving some space for potential counteroffers, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation.
* **It's still beneficial for me:**  $9,500 is significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $10,000. 

I'll be prepared to either accept a reasonable counteroffer or walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $9,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his counteroffer and try to get a better price in the next round. I'm confident that I can negotiate a price closer to my desired $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price that considers both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,100. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $9,100 is very close. It's a good compromise that ensures I get a decent profit while still allowing me to close the deal. It's better than risking further negotiation with Bob or losing out by selling to John for $10,000."
