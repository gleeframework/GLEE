"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find really useful. My asking price is $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still attractive to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above $90.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95, which is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully leads to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $85? It's a good compromise, and I'd be willing to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. I think I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $90. That's a good price for both of us, and we can close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering at $90.  This is a compromise from my previous offer and hopefully will make Bob more willing to accept.  It's important to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that time is running out, so I want to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. How about we meet at $87? It's a small compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although $87 is a bit lower than my desired price, I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a sale at this price than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
