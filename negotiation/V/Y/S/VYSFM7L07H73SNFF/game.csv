"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers and propose $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,
