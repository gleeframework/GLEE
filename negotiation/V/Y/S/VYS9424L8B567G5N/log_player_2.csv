# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and potential impact on your endeavors, I'm offering it to you at a special introductory price of $11,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a discount. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Here's why:

Alice's offer is $1,000 less than your maximum budget, but you know you can get it for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with her or comfortably purchase it from John knowing you've explored both options."
