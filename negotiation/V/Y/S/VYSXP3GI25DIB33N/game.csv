"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500. Would you be open to that?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I am proposing a price of $9,000 for the product. This offers a compromise between our respective positions while still reflecting the value of the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $8,750? This would be a fair price that respects the value of the product while aligning with my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm still not quite there at $8,900. How about $8,800? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",8800.0,Bob,6,
