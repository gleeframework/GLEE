"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,600,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,600,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not able to meet the price at $1,650,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000, which I believe is closer to our initial discussions. I hope this helps us move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
