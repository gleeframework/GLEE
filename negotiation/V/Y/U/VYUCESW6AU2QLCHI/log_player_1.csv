Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile at $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value might be even higher than $15,000 by saying ""someone like you"" and ""significant value."" This aims to create a perception of potential gain for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open-ended with ""What do you think?"", suggesting a willingness to discuss the price further. 

While we have a backup offer, aiming high initially might lead to a more profitable outcome. If Bob rejects the offer, we can always negotiate downwards or proceed with John's offer."
