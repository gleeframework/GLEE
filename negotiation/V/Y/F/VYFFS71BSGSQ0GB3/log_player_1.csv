Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible since John is guaranteed to buy it at that price.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting high leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, or for me to offer a ""discount.""
* **Psychology:** A price slightly below $150 might seem more appealing than a round number like $140, creating a sense of urgency and value.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
