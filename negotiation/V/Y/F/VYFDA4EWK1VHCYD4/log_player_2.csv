"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is within his budget, he can likely do better.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  While $11,000 is closer to his desired price, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  He should reject the offer and try to make another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is closer to the value I place on the product.  This offer reflects a significant reduction from your initial price and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected Alice's offer at $11,000 and counteroffered with $10,000. Alice has now countered with $11,500, which is still higher than Bob's acceptable price.  Given that Alice is unwilling to budge further, and Bob can purchase the product from John for $8,000, it is in Bob's best interest to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John."
