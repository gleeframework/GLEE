"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product is worth $8,000 to me, I'm willing to pay $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is closer to the value I place on the product.  This offer reflects a significant reduction from your initial price and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,5,
