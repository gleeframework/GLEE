"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount.  There's potential to negotiate a lower price with Alice, so it's worth exploring that option before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Starting with an offer of $950,000 is a bold move, but it establishes Bob's willingness to negotiate and sets a clear target.  Alice may counter, but Bob has room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  While it's closer to his desired price point, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to Alice's valuation of the product. Offering $1,000,000 shows good faith while still keeping a bit of buffer in case Alice is willing to budge.  This is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise. It's only $25,000 above Bob's last counteroffer, and significantly less than John's price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling apart is increasing. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within his budget."
