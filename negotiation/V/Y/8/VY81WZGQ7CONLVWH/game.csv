"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get a bit more for it. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,100,000.  This price would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product at a price I can justify and you to achieve a decent profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I need to get a bit closer to the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
