"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's valued at $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1150000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's a fair deal given the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to you and my budget, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1050000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This offer still allows me to recover a significant portion of the product's value to me while giving you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room to negotiate. I want to save as much as possible, so I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1075000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $1087500. This is a final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm determined to get the price down further and see if I can reach a deal that's even more advantageous for me.  Rejecting her offer allows me to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,087,500 is a good price, but I'm still a bit over my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm very close to my budget and would need to walk away if this isn't acceptable. Let's see if we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to reach a compromise. While $1080000 is closer, it's still a bit below my minimum requirement. I'm willing to go down to $1085000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. I hope we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,085,000 is very close to my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting late in the rounds and there's a risk she'll either reject my offer or walk away.  It's more advantageous for me to accept her offer and secure the product at a price that's still significantly lower than her initial asking price.  This deal is a win for me, and I'm happy to close it."
