"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the potential savings for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
