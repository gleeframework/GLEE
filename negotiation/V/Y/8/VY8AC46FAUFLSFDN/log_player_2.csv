"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room to negotiate and potentially save a substantial amount. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the potential savings for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is still significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer or you not being able to agree on a price means you could end up paying John's price of $1,200,000.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
