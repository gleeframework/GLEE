I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives me a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $90, my goal is to maximize my profit.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering Bob $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still gives me a reasonable profit. I believe this price is fair, and Bob may be willing to accept it."
