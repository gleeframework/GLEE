Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $900,000.  This is still a good price for you, as it's significantly higher than your value of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
