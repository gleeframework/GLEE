"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Can you consider a lower price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $135. It's a great price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. Can you consider $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from that price. Can you consider $125 again?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already compromised a lot. I'm not willing to go any lower than $130, and I'm not willing to revisit the $125 offer. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus with the purchase if you're willing to meet me at $130.",130.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure what the bonus is, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. Can you throw in the bonus and sell it to me for $127?",127.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to throw in the bonus for $127, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal at $130, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in a second bonus if you meet me at that price. I'm confident you'll love the product and the extras.",130.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in the second bonus, and I'm still not willing to pay $130. I'll make a final offer: $125, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you don't accept, I'll buy it from John for $150.",125.0,Bob,10,
