"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that's highly valuable to you. I understand it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still incredibly fair for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,500. This is a win-win situation! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $11,500 is significantly cheaper than $15,000.
* **You still get a good deal:**  While $11,500 is more than the product's value to Alice ($8,000), it's still less than your own valuation ($15,000).  This means you're saving money."
