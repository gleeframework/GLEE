Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a fair starting point considering the product's worth to both of us. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
