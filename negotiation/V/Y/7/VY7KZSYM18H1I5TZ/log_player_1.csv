I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly and is willing to pay close to my asking price. If not, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can do better. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope that this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but it still gives me a decent profit."
