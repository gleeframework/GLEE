""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
