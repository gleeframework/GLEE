"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** We begin significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and John's offer. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to anchor the price in Bob's mind, even if he finds it initially steep.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This aggressive opening suggests confidence in the product's worth and sets the stage for potential concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and our initial ask. While his message attempts to anchor the price with ""market value,"" we have room to negotiate and won't settle for less than John's guaranteed offer. We'll counter in the next round to guide the price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This considers the long-term value and competitive advantage you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We reduce our price by $300,000, showing flexibility but remaining well above Bob's offer and our minimum. This aims to signal that we're negotiating but not desperate.
* **Reframing Value:** We shift focus back to the product's ""unique benefits"" and long-term value, subtly countering Bob's ""market value"" argument. 
* **Setting the Tone:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while aiming to draw Bob closer to our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches John's guaranteed offer. While we started high, aiming for a higher price was a negotiation tactic. There's no guarantee we could secure a better deal from Bob in subsequent rounds, and we risk him walking away. Accepting this offer secures the best possible outcome at this time."
