"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it will be extremely valuable to you. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1400000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This is a fair price considering the negotiation we've had so far. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1300000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1350000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's get this done!",1350000.0,Alice,5,
