Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product's value, but I think we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling it to me for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not ready to accept $12,000. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? It's a fair compromise and closer to the value we both understand the product holds."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $12300 for your product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $12,300 is a good compromise and a decent profit. It's also better than selling to John for $12,000."
