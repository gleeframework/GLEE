{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still provides a good deal for both of us.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
