"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000 for this product. This price aligns with my budget and reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still provides a good deal for both of us.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
