"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

We're aiming low to give us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $800,000 maximum."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to make this a worthwhile deal for both of us. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming to get closer to that $800,000 mark. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

We're moving closer to our limit and showing Alice we're willing to negotiate, but we still have a buffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  I believe this price point acknowledges the value you see while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Alice is meeting us close to the middle ground. While it's slightly above our ideal price, it's still within our $800,000 limit and a better deal than we'd get from John."
