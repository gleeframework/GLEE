"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $102.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. How about we meet at $97.50?,97.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $100? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure about $100. How about we meet at $95?,95.0,Bob,6,
