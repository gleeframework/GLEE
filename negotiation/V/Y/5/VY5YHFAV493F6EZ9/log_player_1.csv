Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $130. How about we try again? I'm willing to pay $110, which is a bit closer to your original offer, but still within my budget. Can you meet me at $110?

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
