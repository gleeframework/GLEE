Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you're in a strong position. Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,200,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence about the offer's fairness can make Bob more likely to consider it seriously. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You achieve a significant profit beyond your baseline.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You have room to lower the price, potentially still exceeding $800,000. 
* **Bob Rejects:**  You proceed to sell to John at your guaranteed price."
