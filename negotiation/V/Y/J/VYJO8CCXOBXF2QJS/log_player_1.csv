{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It's also higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,000,000), giving him incentive to consider the deal. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and even lower than the product is worth to him.  While it's tempting to sell quickly, it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer will allow you to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price for both of us and allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what you ideally want. It's worth exploring if you can get a little closer to your target price before settling."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to continue working with you. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but no higher. How about we meet at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has been insistent on his price, and it seems like we've reached an impasse. While $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I would like to get.  Since I have another buyer ready to pay my minimum acceptable price, it's better to sell to John and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
