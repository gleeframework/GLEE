"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price for both of us and allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to continue working with you. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,037,500.  This is a fair price, and I believe we can finalize this deal.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but no higher. How about we meet at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
