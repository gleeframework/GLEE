"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm starting at $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet at $975,000?  It's a fair price that considers both of our needs.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice. However, $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $975,000. How about we try $937,500? It's a fair compromise that I hope we can both agree on.",937500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $937,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again - how about $956,250?  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",956250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice. However, $956,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll try to get a bit closer to my target. How about we try $940,000? It's a fair compromise that I hope we can both agree on.",940000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your ongoing effort to find a compromise.  However, $940,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but it needs to be closer to my last offer. How about $948,125? This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's closer to your budget. Let's finalize this deal.",948125.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $948,125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $942,500? It's a fair compromise that I hope we can both agree on.",942500.0,Bob,8,
