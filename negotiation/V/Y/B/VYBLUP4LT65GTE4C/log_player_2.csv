"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I suggest we start negotiations at $140. This price reflects the product's quality and the benefits it offers. Let me know if this is within your considerations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting price of $140 is too close to your maximum budget of $150.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply buy it from John for $10 less."
