"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,050,000? This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $1,075,000? This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
