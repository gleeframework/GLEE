"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a remarkable product that holds immense value for you. Given its significance to you, I propose a special deal for this exceptional item. My offer is $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects the unique combination of quality and utility it offers, while also providing you with a substantial saving compared to its intrinsic worth of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair and advantageous proposition for both parties. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for a lower price."
