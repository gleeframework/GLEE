"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I have to say that $12000 is a bit below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14000? I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the value it would bring to my life. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer! I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer it to you for $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
