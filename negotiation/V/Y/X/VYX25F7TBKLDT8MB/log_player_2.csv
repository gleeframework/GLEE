Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I have to say that $12000 is a bit below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer! I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty.
