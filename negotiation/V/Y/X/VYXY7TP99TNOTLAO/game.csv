"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate the special price, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $130? I'm really interested in the product, but need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to go up to $140.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $145. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
