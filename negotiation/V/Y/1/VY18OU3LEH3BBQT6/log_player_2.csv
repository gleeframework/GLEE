Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,250,000 is closer to his target price, it's still higher than what John is selling the product for.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to move on price.  I'm willing to come down slightly further.  How about we settle at $1,200,000?  This reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is the same price as John is selling the product for.  There's no benefit for Bob to continue negotiating with Alice, as he can simply buy from John and get the product at the same price."
