"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $600,000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount for you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something lower.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is still significantly less than the product's value. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop the price to $800,000. This would be a great deal for you and would allow me to ensure a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
