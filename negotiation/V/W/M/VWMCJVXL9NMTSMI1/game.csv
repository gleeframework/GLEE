"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $120 for this item. Would you like to accept this offer?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $90 at this time. Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your interest in our product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget constraints. Please let me know if this is something you would consider.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90.  If you're not able to come down to that, I'll have to consider other options.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I am willing to lower the price to $100. This represents a significant discount compared to the original price and still allows us to cover costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",100.0,Alice,5,
