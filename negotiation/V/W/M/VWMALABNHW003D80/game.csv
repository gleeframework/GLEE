"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I'm seeking. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, acknowledging your concerns. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and its potential for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if this revised offer works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off. How about $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
