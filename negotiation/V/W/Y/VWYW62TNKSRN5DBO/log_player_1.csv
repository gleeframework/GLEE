Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for less than it's worth to you, and I'll get a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob:** My message emphasizes the value Bob will get for the product, making it more likely he'll consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've framed the message in a way that suggests I'm open to negotiation,  but I'm not giving away too much right away.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation.  By offering a price that's a bit higher, I'm hoping to get Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. I'll then evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. If the negotiation goes south, I have the option of selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more competitive. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's counteroffer of $90 is only $10 less than my initial offer and is significantly closer to my desired price point than John's offer of $80.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Even though I'm accepting his offer, it doesn't mean the negotiation is over.  I can still use this acceptance as a stepping stone to potentially push for a higher price in future transactions with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale at a price that is close to my goal.  It also keeps the relationship with Bob open for potential future negotiations. While selling to John for $80 is a safe option, it limits my potential earnings."
