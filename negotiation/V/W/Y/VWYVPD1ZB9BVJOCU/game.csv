"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $130? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get great value for the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $125 again? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,125.0,Bob,4,
