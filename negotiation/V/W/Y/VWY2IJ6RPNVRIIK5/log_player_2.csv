"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. While Alice's offer is lower than her value of $150, it's still higher than your maximum price. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $110. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $135 but still above my maximum price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate while still being within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still slightly higher than my maximum price of $120.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. John is offering the product for my maximum price, so it's the best option for me."
