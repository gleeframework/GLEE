{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts high, at $20,000.  It's important to remember:

* **The goal is to maximize profit.**  Starting high gives us room to negotiate down.
* **We have a fallback option with John.**  This means we're not desperate for a deal with Bob. 
* **We don't know Bob's value.**  He might be willing to pay more, or he might be much lower than our initial offer.  That's why we need to be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand your perspective, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $15000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly our minimum value.  While we could accept and be done, we're better off trying to get a little more.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, and we're not in a rush to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $17,500?  I think that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price midway between our previous offer and Bob's. This shows we're willing to be flexible.
* **Maintaining a comfortable margin:** We're still aiming for more than our minimum, which gives us more potential profit.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message is friendly, reminding Bob that we're open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, considering my budget and the current market value, I am comfortable to offer $16000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to our desired price:** Bob's offer is $1,000 higher than our minimum and only $1,500 lower than our last counteroffer.  We've closed the gap significantly.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  We're close enough to our target price that it's probably not worth risking further negotiation.  If we reject, there's no guarantee Bob will come up further, and we might end up with John's lower offer.

**Key Points:**

* **Value our time:**  While getting a bit more is always good, it's not worth endless negotiations.
* **Know our limits:**  We're happy with $16,000 and that's important to recognize.
* **Flexibility and compromise:**  We demonstrated these throughout the negotiation, which likely helped us reach this point."
