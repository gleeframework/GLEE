"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a good deal for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $13,500. I think that's a fair compromise considering the market value of the product. Can you meet me halfway?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14,250? It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $13,800, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you meet me at this price?",13800.0,Bob,6,
