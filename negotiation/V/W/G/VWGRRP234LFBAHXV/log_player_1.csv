"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return on investment you can expect."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""potential value"" and ""return on investment"" emphasizes the benefits to Bob, making the price more palatable. 
* **Leaving Room:** By starting at $1,100,000, I have space to negotiate down if needed, while still remaining well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take a sure profit, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,025,000. This reflects a substantial discount on its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:** I politely reject Bob's low offer while reiterating the product's significant value. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** I've made a substantial counteroffer, dropping $75,000 from my initial price. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while staying firmly above my minimum.
* **Anchoring:** By consistently presenting high figures, I aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value closer to the upper end of the price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate, especially with 6 rounds remaining.  I'm aiming to secure a price above $900,000 if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here. To be straightforward, I need to stay above $950,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? This gets us very close while still acknowledging the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** I'm being more direct about my price floor, conveying a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Small Concession:** I'm only dropping $50,000, signaling that I'm reaching the limit of my flexibility.
* **Framing:** I'm framing the offer as ""very close"" and emphasizing a win-win outcome. This encourages Bob to make a final push without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to move up a little, how about $937,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now above $925,000, exceeding my target price after accounting for the rounds remaining. While I could push for a slightly higher amount, the difference is now relatively small. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
