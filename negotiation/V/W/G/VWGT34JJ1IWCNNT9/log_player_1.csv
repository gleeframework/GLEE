Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $80 to Bob. I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, giving me the chance to negotiate a price closer to my minimum of $100. However, if he rejects, I have the option to go with John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price from $110 to $95. This is a significant concession, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above his offer of $80. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
