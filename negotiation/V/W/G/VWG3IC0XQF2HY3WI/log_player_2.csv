You can do better than $90.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

You're still better off holding out. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $90.50?

While $90.5 is getting closer to your ideal price, you're still better off trying to negotiate a bit more. You can likely get it for $90 or even a bit lower with continued negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make at least $92 to make it worth my while. How about $91.50?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.5

At this point, the price is getting too close to what John is offering. It's better to save yourself the hassle and buy from John for $100.  You're still getting a product that's worth $100 to you for a price that's worth $100 to you."
