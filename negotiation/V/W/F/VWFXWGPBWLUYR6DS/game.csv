"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9250.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm on a tight budget and $9,250 is still a stretch for me. Would you consider $8,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to squeeze every last penny out of the deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I think it's getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm making one more concession, but I need to be confident I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,5,,
