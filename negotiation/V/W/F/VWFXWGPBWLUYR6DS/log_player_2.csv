Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm on a tight budget and $9,250 is still a stretch for me. Would you consider $8,750? I think that's a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to squeeze every last penny out of the deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I think it's getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm making one more concession, but I need to be confident I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $9,000 secures a decent price and avoids the risk of her backing out or the negotiations stalling."
