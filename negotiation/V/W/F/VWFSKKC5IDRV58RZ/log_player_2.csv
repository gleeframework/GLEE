"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the product for a lower price, as Alice values the product at $10,000. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start a counteroffer process and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's initial counteroffer should be significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  $12,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product but offers a substantial discount from the initial offer. This will prompt Alice to consider negotiating further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is within Bob's budget and a decent compromise. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids the risk of needing to buy from John at a higher cost."
