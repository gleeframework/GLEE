"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but leaving some room for negotiation. This maximizes my potential profit while giving Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a good deal, I'm aiming for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin."
