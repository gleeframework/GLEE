Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $11,500 is higher than Bob's $10,000 valuation, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for you to negotiate down if needed, ensuring you don't sell below your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he can get a good deal.

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he seems unwilling to negotiate, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is far too low. It's well below my minimum value of $12,000 and significantly lower than my initial offer. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still slightly below my minimum. This will show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that his offer is not acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10000. I really think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is right at the edge of my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $12,000,  it's a reasonable offer given the negotiation history and the potential for a long back-and-forth. 

Accepting this offer ensures I avoid the risk of further negotiations with Bob, and potentially losing him as a buyer. It also avoids me having to rely on John, who may have other options or may not be as reliable."
