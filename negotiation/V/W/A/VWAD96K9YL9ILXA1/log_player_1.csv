Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit away from $13,000. I'm willing to go up to $12,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's tempting to hold out for the full $13,000, but Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, and $12,800 is a strong profit. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk the deal falling apart in later rounds."
