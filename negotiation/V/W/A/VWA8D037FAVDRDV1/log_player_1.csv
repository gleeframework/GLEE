I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to counter with $1,125,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. It also leaves a reasonable profit margin for Bob, making it likely he'll accept."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's very close and we've been going back and forth for a few rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and only getting $1,000,000 from John."
