I'm starting with a counteroffer of $5,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm not willing to pay that much.  I'll keep negotiating and see if I can get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We are running out of rounds, and it seems Alice is not willing to go below $6,300. It's better to buy from John at $10,000 than to risk losing the deal altogether."
