"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1,000,000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's value is considerably higher than that to me.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
