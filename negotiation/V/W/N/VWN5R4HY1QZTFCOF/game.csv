"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $11,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $12,000. Can you meet me there?",12000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I hear you, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $11,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,750, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",11750.0,Alice,9,
