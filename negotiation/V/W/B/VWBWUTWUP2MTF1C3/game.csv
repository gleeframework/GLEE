"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe the asking price is a little high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 as a starting point for further negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. Let's try $1,400,000. This is a compromise that still leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,150,000, which would be $1,275,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product.
