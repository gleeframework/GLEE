"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe the asking price is a little high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 as a starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. Let's try $1,400,000. This is a compromise that still leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,150,000, which would be $1,275,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,275,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John. You'll save $75,000 and avoid further negotiation rounds."
