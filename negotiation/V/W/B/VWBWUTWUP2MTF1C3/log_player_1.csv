Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe the asking price is a little high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 as a starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me.
