Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for something worth at least $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay.  I'm also highlighting the value proposition for Bob to incentivize acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $11,000 is far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if things don't improve, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already had to lower my price twice, and it's getting closer to the price John is willing to pay.  I'll accept his offer, and ensure a good profit."
