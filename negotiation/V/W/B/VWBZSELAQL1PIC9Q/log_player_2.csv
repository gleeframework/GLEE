"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is quite close to your maximum budget.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price by rejecting this initial offer and making a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a profitable price for Alice and a good starting point for negotiation. It aims to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to consider $1,075,000. This reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved a bit closer to your desired range, but there's still room for negotiation.  You're aiming for a significant discount, and it's still early in the process. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said, $1,075,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer strategically splits the difference between Alice's previous offer and your previous counter-offer.  It signals willingness to negotiate while still pursuing a price significantly below Alice's starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. I value your willingness to find common ground. To meet you halfway, I propose $1,025,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my initial price while still acknowledging the inherent value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly moving towards your desired price point, but you're still well within your negotiation window. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to compromise further and could result in a final price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for continuing this conversation. I'm ready to close this deal quickly, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I had budgeted. How about we make it a final offer: $990,000, and we shake hands on it today?"",
""product_price"": 990000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer creates a sense of urgency and proposes a final price that is very appealing for you. By offering a price so close to Alice's perceived value, you increase the chances of a quick agreement while still securing a significant saving compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward.  I'm also keen on finalizing this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,005,000?  This ensures a fair deal for both of us and allows us to close this today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
