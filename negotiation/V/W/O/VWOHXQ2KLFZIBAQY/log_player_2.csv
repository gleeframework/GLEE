"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to try and save some money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you while still allowing me a reasonable return. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within my budget and represents a good deal. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer, leaving me with only the option of buying from John at $1,000,000. It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
