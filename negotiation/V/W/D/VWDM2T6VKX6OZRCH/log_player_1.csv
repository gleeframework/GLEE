Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Time Value of Money:** While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if it means a slightly lower profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a sale quickly."
