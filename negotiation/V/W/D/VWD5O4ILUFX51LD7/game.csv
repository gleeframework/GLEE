"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  How about we bring it down a bit to something more manageable?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $850,000. I'm thinking of a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $925,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need us to land on a number that works for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $912,500? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $912,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get a bit closer to my desired price. How about we try $915,000? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this simple - I'm willing to pay $910,000.  This is my final offer.",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $910,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. How about we try $915,500? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",915500.0,Alice,9,
