"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  It's likely Alice will be willing to come down a bit, and Bob still has 9 rounds to negotiate before he needs to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  I think that's a fair compromise given the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and continue to try for a lower price. While John's offer is always an option, Bob still has 7 rounds to try and get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
