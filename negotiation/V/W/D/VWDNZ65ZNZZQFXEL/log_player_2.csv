Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further. While $1,200,000 is closer to your budget, it's still a significant risk. You can try a counteroffer closer to $800,000, but be prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice is unwilling to budge significantly."
