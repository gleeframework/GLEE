Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $135. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  $135 is higher than what Bob values the product at, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum acceptable price of $150, so you're already making a profit. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for a price that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $130? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. However, I am still unable to meet at $130. I would like to propose $125 as my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I can get from John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, and $125 is getting closer.  However, I'm still a little too far from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $127.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 127.5}
