"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $130? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. However, I am still unable to meet at $130. I would like to propose $125 as my maximum offer.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, and $125 is getting closer.  However, I'm still a little too far from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $127.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",127.5,Alice,5,
