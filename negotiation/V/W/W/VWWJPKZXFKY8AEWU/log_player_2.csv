"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is much higher. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to negotiate a price closer to his desired range. He's offering $100, which is still a good deal for Alice, but also significantly lower than her initial offer. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also a savvy negotiator."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good compromise. Bob initially wanted to pay $100, and this offer is only $10 more. Considering that he values the product at $150, and John is selling it for that price, accepting this offer is a good choice. Bob saves $40 compared to John's price and still gets a decent deal."
