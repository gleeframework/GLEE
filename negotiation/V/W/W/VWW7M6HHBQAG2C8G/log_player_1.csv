"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Based on my assessment, I am willing to pay $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This reflects its value while still being a good deal for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still believe we can negotiate further. Based on my assessment, I am willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

At this point, Bob is unwilling to budge above our minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds for a potential minimal gain. John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which matches Bob's current offer."
