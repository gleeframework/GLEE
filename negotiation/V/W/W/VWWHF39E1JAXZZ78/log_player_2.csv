"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is lower than her original offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the product for $10,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, but buying from John is a guaranteed option."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $14,000 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $13,000. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice is now offering $13,500, it's still above Bob's budget. John is offering the product for $10,000, which is well within Bob's limit and guarantees a good deal."
