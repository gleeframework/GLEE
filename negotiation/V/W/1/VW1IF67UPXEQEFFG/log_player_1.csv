"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and leaves potential for both of us to gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but still above Bob's initial counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,400,000, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a significant profit. Considering the limited rounds and the potential for a longer negotiation, it's wise to accept this offer and secure the sale."
