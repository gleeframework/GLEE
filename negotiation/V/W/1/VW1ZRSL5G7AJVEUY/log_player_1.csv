Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to aim high with Bob. 
* **Justification for Value:**  The message hints at the product's value but doesn't reveal all details, encouraging Bob to engage in further discussion. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. You can always come down in price, but you can't go back up after a low offer."
