"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial valuation. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a stretch for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm firm on my offer of $8,500, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  It's a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget.  What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm not ready to give up on a better deal just yet. I'm willing to come down another $500 and offer you $9,000. This is my final concession, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a little high for me. I'm feeling very close to a deal, and I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,6,
