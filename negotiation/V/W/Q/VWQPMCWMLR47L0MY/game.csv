"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with.  I'd like to offer you $750000. This reflects my budget and hopefully allows us to move forward with a deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $825000. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the product's value, while also being mindful of your budget.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute limit for this purchase. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go below $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we're not even close to the minimum price I was thinking of. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
