Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a tough pill for me to swallow.  To be frank, I can't justify going any higher than $1,350,000.  That's a really strong offer, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a sign of my serious interest in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price."
