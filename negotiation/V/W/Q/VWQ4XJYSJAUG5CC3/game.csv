"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your vision. To kick off our conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and exploring possibilities that benefit us both.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This reflects a considerable adjustment on my end while still acknowledging the product's value.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but $1,850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I can do $1,200,000 - that's a sizable jump on my end, and I think it's a fair offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, but it's still a significant gap from where I see its value.  Let's try to bridge this - how about $1,600,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end while hopefully still aligning with what you're willing to invest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a tough pill for me to swallow.  To be frank, I can't justify going any higher than $1,350,000.  That's a really strong offer, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a sign of my serious interest in this product.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
