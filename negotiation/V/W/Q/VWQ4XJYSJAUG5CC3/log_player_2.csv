# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your vision.

{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This reflects a considerable adjustment on my end while still acknowledging the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but $1,850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I can do $1,200,000 - that's a sizable jump on my end, and I think it's a fair offer."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, but it's still a significant gap from where I see its value.  Let's try to bridge this - how about $1,600,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end while hopefully still aligning with what you're willing to invest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

``` 

We're still pretty far apart, and I want to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to my range.  It's still early enough in the negotiation to push a bit more."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a tough pill for me to swallow.  To be frank, I can't justify going any higher than $1,350,000.  That's a really strong offer, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a sign of my serious interest in this product."",
