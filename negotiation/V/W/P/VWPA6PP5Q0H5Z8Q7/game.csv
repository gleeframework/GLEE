"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the potential it holds for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
