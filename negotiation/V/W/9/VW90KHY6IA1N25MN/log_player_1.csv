Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the walk-away point:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This is your safety net.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Any offer above this has the potential to be accepted.
* **Aiming high:**  Starting with an offer of $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant portion of the potential profit above Bob's valuation. 
* **Creating urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
