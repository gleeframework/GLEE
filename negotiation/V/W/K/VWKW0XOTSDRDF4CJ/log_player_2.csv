"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for a lower price. There's room to negotiate with Alice since her minimum value is $15,000. Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's slightly above what I'm willing to pay from John, but significantly lower than Alice's offer. This allows for some room for negotiation, while still keeping the price within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is within my budget and only slightly higher than John's price.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get me a price much lower than this, and there's a risk that Alice will either reject my next counteroffer or walk away from the deal entirely. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
