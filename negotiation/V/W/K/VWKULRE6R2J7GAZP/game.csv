"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,300,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
