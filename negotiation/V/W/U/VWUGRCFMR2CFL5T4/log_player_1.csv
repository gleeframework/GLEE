{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price of $130.  There's still room for negotiation and I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $117.50? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $110 is a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's still a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
