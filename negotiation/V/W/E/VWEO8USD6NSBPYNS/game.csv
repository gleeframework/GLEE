"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking for a price point closer to $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire for a better price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $795,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
