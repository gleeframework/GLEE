Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you can always negotiate down towards your minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of knowing John will buy the product for $80. This means you don't have to feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
