Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  However, I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price of $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I want to see if I can push for a better deal.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price from Bob, or at least get closer to my minimum before needing to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,600,000. This is still below my minimum price but significantly higher than his offer.  I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also protecting my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still significantly below my minimum price.  I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get a better deal from Bob.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $1,500,000. This will guarantee I meet my minimum price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
