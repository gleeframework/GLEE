"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. It's a steal!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $130 is better than her product's value to her ($150), you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You should reject this offer and aim for the better deal."
