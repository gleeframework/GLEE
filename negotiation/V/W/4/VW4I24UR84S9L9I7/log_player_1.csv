Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $140. This is a good starting point because it's a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130. It shows I'm willing to be flexible but still aiming for a good price."
