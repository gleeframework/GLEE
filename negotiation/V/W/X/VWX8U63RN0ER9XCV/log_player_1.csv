"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, but not excessively so. This allows for negotiation and gives me a starting point to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,750,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
