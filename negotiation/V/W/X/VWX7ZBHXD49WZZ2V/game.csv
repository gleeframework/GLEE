"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that being said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still providing you with a substantial profit. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I'm still very interested in the product, $1,350,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This price is within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,325,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
