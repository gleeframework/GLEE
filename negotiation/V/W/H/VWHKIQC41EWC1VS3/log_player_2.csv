{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. By offering $700,000, Bob is making a significant counteroffer that demonstrates his serious interest in the product while also leaving room for negotiation. This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of Bob's maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  He is raising his offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 remains significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while potentially getting closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could continue to negotiate, $815,000 is a very good price, especially considering Alice's previous offers and John's price of $1,500,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a significantly lower price than John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation stalling or Alice backing out entirely."
