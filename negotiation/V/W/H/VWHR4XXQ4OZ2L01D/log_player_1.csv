Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $130 offer allows for Bob to counteroffer and still lets me potentially make more than I would selling to John. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward, avoiding unnecessary details that could complicate the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I know the product is worth more to him. I'll try to negotiate a better price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price significantly from the initial offer.
* **Targeting a Fair Price:** $115 is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's offer and my previous price.  
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** This price still allows me to make a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting closer, Alice.  How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains. Bob is clearly trying to get the best possible deal, and further haggling might not be worth the risk of him walking away. 
* **Reasonable Profit:**  $105 is still a $5 profit over my guaranteed sale to John. It's a reasonable compromise.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and ensures a sale."
