Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still being a good starting point for me.  I'm confident in the product's value and willing to hold out for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum. I'm willing to risk a bit more negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $10,500.  This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer but still leaving me with a decent profit.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much.  While $9,500 is a decent offer, I'm not eager to continue the negotiation.  Selling to John for $10,000 ensures I get my minimum desired price and saves me further haggling."
