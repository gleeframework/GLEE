"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $900,000, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're looking for.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not sure if I can meet you there. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  $1,250,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like. How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
