"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about negotiating.  $8,500 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a little too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $9250.  That's a good compromise, and still a fair price for this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try and push for a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9250 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer, but still keeping it within his budget.  $9,000 is a strong compromise point that could potentially get the deal done."
