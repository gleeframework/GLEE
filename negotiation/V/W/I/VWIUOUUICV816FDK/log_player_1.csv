{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob, so I'll reject his offer.  He seems interested, and I think I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  That's a good compromise, and still a fair price for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9250 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $9000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $9,000 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  It's important to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful negotiation."
