"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay $12,000 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or even find a better deal elsewhere."
