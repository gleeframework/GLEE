Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in this product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my desired price and his perceived value. However, it's still more than my fallback option. Let's try to negotiate a bit more.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $13,000 is already a fair price, reflecting the value this product brings. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? That feels like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob is clearly anchored around the $10,000 mark. While I could push further, accepting this offer nets me a decent profit over John's offer.
