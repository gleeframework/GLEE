"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm working with a tight budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
