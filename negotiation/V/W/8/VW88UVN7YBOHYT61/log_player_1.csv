Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Even though Bob values the product at $8,000,  Alice starts with a higher offer ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's valuation if he's particularly interested.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly suggesting the price is justified. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice is prepared to negotiate if Bob counters or shows hesitation.  The goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both parties, ideally closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay."
