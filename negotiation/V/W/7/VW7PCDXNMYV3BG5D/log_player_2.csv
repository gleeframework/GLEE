"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We believe it's a game-changer and would like to offer it to you for $900,000. We're confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is intriguing, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my own budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the best we can do at this point, but we're confident you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $875,000 is a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $860,000?  This price is closer to your valuation, and it would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. We're willing to meet you closer to your target price. We're willing to sell the product to you for $870,000. This is as low as we can go, but we're confident you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $870,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and it's getting closer to Bob's target of saving as much money as possible. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating and maybe get a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and potentially ending up paying John's price is too high.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
