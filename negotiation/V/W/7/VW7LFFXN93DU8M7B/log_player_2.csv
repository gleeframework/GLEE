"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value and the fact that it's worth $15000 to you, I would like to propose an initial price of $14000. This offers a slight discount compared to its full value while still ensuring a fair profit for me. I believe this is a mutually beneficial opportunity. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
