Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
