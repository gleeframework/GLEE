"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget.  You should reject and counteroffer to start the negotiation process."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and it's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You should reject and make another counteroffer. You are still in a better position to negotiate as you have the option to buy from John for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'll meet you at $920,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $920,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice won't go lower. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for a guaranteed price of $800,000."
