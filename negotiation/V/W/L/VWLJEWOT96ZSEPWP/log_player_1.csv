"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting high, but still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to Bob.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob some space to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal while still securing a profitable price for me.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob emphasizes the potential benefit he'll gain from purchasing it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I have 10 rounds, and while Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John's Deal:** I want to maximize my profit, and selling to John right now would limit my potential.  
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is still favorable to me but hopefully more appealing to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $950,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value the product brings to you, while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's price but still significantly above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining a favorable position. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to encourage him to see the worth in paying a bit more.
* **Room for Compromise:** By proposing $1,050,000, I'm leaving space for further negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied.  
* **Avoidance of John's Deal:** I still want to prioritize maximizing my profits and believe a better deal with Bob is possible."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** We are only in Round 4, so I have plenty of time to continue negotiating with Bob.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, there's still room for negotiation. I might be able to secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding John's Deal:**  Selling to John would be a guaranteed profit, but I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to meet him halfway."

```

* **Negotiation is Progressing:** Although Bob is not yet at my desired price, we are getting closer with each round.  
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially with 4 rounds remaining.
* **Avoiding John's Deal:**  I'm not yet ready to settle for John's offer, as I'm confident I can secure a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, attempting to close the gap further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there!  Your offer of $990,000 is getting very close. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,005,000.  This is my final compromise, and I truly believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1005000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping to $1,005,000, making it clear this is my final offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a near-perfect middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest proposal.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal, as we are getting close to the end of the negotiation process.
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  While not ideal, this price still allows me to make a considerable profit and avoids selling to John at a lower price.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Close but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit below the $1,200,000 mark. I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for that price, so I'm not willing to settle for a lower amount just yet.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still a chance to negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob, especially considering how close we are to a deal.
* **Avoiding John's Deal for Now:**  I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob, and selling to John would limit my potential profit. 

**Next Steps:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to close the remaining gap and secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I understand you're trying to get the best possible price.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,002,000. This is just $2,000 above your last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  We're nearly at the end of our negotiations, so let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1002000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer, emphasizing urgency and a commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Small Compromise:** The $1,002,000 offer is a very small step up from Bob's last offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Highlighting Time Constraint:**  I'm reminding Bob that we have only one round left before I sell to John, making the current offer more appealing.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While not ideal, this price is still above my minimum and avoids losing out on a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Final Push:** I'm making a final push to convince Bob to accept, as selling to John would be a less desirable outcome."
