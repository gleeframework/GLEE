Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I value at $10,000.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $9,500, which is $1,500 more than Bob values the product. This gives him incentive to counteroffer, but also leaves some profit for me. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer allows me to see how motivated Bob is to buy the product. If he's quick to counteroffer, I know he's interested. If he rejects without counteroffering, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $8,000. Accepting this offer would be a major loss for me.
* **Room for Counteroffer:**  Bob has shown interest by making a counteroffer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, selling to John for $10,000 guarantees my minimum desired value. This option remains open if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value it at $10,000, I understand your offer. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer of $8,500 is halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $7,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Addressing Bob's concerns:**  My message directly addresses Bob's interest in the product and acknowledges his offer. This helps to maintain a positive rapport and encourages further negotiation.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:**  My message emphasizes that this price would be beneficial for both of us, leaving room for both parties to be satisfied. This can help to sway Bob towards accepting my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I will successfully sell the product for a price closer to my desired value.
* If Bob rejects my offer, I will have to decide whether to make another counteroffer, or if it's more worthwhile to sell the product to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  While I'd prefer more, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Bob's continued interest:** Bob has made a counteroffer, showing he's still interested in buying the product and willing to negotiate. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will counteroffer again, and I might end up selling to John for the same price anyway. 

**Next Steps:** I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.  This outcome is good for me, as I secured a price that is closer to my minimum value while also closing the deal."
