"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to own this product, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $700000.  This reflects the value I place on this unique product while remaining within my budget. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant amount, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the unique features and benefits of the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I value the product, $850000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to offer $800000 for this unique piece. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
