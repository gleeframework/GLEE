"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your perceived value and allows me a healthy profit. I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $825,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer.  How about $860,000?  It's a significant move on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,
