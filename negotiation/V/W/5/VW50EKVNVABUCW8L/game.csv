"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $20,000 is really the lowest I can go. This product is truly one of a kind and will bring you significant value in the long run. I'm confident you'll see a return on this investment quickly. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet at $17,500. I would like to propose $16,000 as a compromise. I hope this meets within your acceptable range.",16000.0,Bob,4,
