You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a buffer of $2,000 before reaching your maximum price, so there's room to make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000, given the value this product brings.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your ideal price point.  You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your $8,500 offer."
