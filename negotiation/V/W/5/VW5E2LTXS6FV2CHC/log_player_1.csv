Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is a great fit for you. My asking price is $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, so there's space for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's being ripped off.
* **It shows confidence:** By asking for a high price initially, you demonstrate confidence in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** While $8,500 is close to your minimum, it's still less than what you're willing to accept.
* **There's room to negotiate:** You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer of $9,500, potentially reaching a compromise that benefits both of you.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, you have a guaranteed $8,000 from John, so you're not in a rush to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000, given the value this product brings.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $8,750 is only $250 below your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:**  Even though Bob rejected your previous offer, he is willing to negotiate, and you could potentially get him to go higher with another counteroffer. However, there's a risk he could walk away. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of the negotiation falling through and you having to settle for John's lower offer.

While a counteroffer might potentially earn you more, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale close to your minimum, reducing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
