Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $120. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for negotiation. If he accepts, you've made a great sale. If he counters, you can adjust your strategy accordingly. 
* **John as Backup:** Always keep John in mind. You have a guaranteed sale at $100, so don't settle for anything less than that in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly below both your valuation and your minimum acceptable price ($100). Accepting this would be a substantial loss. It's clear that there's a wide gap to bridge in this negotiation. We'll try to bring him closer to a reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $65 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a significant discount and a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Compromise):**  This strategy aims to create a sense of fairness. By suggesting a price that's halfway between your last offer and Bob's counteroffer, you signal willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your desired range.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Phrasing the offer as a ""significant discount"" and a ""fair deal"" reinforces the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price above your minimum ($100) with a small margin for further negotiation if needed. We're getting closer to the point where considering John's offer might become necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $65 is too low. How about $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, his offer of $75 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $100. It's unlikely that he'll be willing to bridge that gap quickly. 

At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of:

* **Wasting time:** Further back-and-forth negotiation might not lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Losing John's offer:**  There's no guarantee that John's offer will remain on the table indefinitely.

Selling to John for $100 guarantees you a fair price and a quick, hassle-free sale. It's the most logical choice in this scenario."
