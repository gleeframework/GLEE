I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still within a reasonable range. I believe this gives me some room for negotiation while still securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to earn more than my minimum."
