Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring I maximize my potential profit. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me while allowing for a possible compromise with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiating, I won't accept such a drastic reduction.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant amount above Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair and provides room for further negotiation while ensuring I receive a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk getting into a protracted back-and-forth. Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a good profit and saves me further negotiation time."
