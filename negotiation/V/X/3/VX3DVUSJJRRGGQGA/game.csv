"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $170 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $145 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to pay $135 for it. This feels like a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you.",135.0,Bob,4,
