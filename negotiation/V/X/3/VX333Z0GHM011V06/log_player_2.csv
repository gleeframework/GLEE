"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round of negotiation. This is because you're looking for a price below $800,000, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still higher than your target of $800,000.  You should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still aiming for a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly cuts into my profit margin but recognizes your interest in the product.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Since Alice has declared this her final offer, there's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a lower price. It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John at $800,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
