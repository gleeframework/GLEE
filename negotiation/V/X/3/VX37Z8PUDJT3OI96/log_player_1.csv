Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $950,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **High but Justifiable:** The offer is high but justifiable by emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""significant benefits"" Bob would receive. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have a guaranteed $800,000 from John. This safety net allows you to confidently aim high with Bob."
