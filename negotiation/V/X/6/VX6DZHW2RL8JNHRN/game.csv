"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but I'm trying to stay under $11,000. How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",11000.0,Alice,3,
