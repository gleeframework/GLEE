"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, you can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  You know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but I'm trying to stay under $11,000. How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good price for you. It's within your budget and a better deal than buying from John. Accepting this offer will save you money."
