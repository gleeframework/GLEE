"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,250.  However, I'm still a bit tight on budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
