"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  While $9,250 is better than $10,000 and much better than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get the price lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."
