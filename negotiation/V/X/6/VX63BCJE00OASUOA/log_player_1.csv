Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, knowing John is a guaranteed sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **High Perceived Value:**  The message emphasizes a ""special price,"" subtly implying Bob is getting a deal even though it's just below your guaranteed sale price. 
 
**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might accept $149, netting you a higher profit than selling to John immediately."
