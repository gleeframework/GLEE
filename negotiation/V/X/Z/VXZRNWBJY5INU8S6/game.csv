"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $750000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $750000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $675000?  This seems like a fair price considering the potential value of this product.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $675000 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $725000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
