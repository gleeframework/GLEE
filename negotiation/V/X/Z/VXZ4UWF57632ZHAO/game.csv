"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from it.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product.  However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still give you a healthy profit and allow me to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations.  While $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $900,000? This reflects a compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to close the deal at $875,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction quickly.",875000.0,Bob,4,
