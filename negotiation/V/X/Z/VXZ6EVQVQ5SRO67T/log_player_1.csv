"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it's really valuable and could benefit you greatly. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a very favorable deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high price will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he flat out rejects it, I know I need to come down significantly. If he counters, it gives me a better sense of his price range.
* **John as Backup:** I keep in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $100 at any point. This gives me leverage and allows me to walk away from a bad deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I need to see if I can negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to go lower, but not to $85 yet.  Selling to John for $100 is my safety net, but I believe I can still get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I believe the product is worth more than your offer, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (ish):**  I've significantly decreased my price from $130 to $110, signaling flexibility. However, I haven't gone below my $100 minimum.
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $110, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range.  Even if Bob counters, it's less likely he'll go much lower than this new point. 
* **Maintaining Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value while acknowledging Bob's offer. This reinforces that I'm making a concession, not accepting a lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we settle on $95?  That seems fair given our starting positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is now above my absolute minimum of $100. While I could try to push for a bit more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation won't result in a significantly better deal. Taking the $95 now guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
