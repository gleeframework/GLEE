Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm starting with a price that allows room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can always lower the price or sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, and I'd rather sell to him than take the risk of further negotiation."
