"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique item. Would you be willing to consider $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still limited to my $12000 budget. Perhaps we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but I can't go any higher. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking that the product's value is worth more than $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $14500? It's a bit above your original offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for this unique item.",14500.0,Alice,5,
