"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $170, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$170 Offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum value. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer downwards. 
* **Message:** My message is friendly and sets the stage for a potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $170 seems a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is way too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $130? It's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130 Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price to $130, which is still above my minimum value of $150. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I believe $130 is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and Bob's initial offer.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and trying to keep the conversation positive, emphasizing the value of the product."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I will try to counter with an offer that is still above my minimum but more appealing to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's do $125.  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$125 Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $125, which is right in the middle of my previous offer ($130) and Bob's latest offer ($115). This shows flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Reasoning:**  I believe $125 is a reasonable price, considering the value of the product and Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm staying polite and encouraging a positive negotiation. I'm using phrases like ""meet you halfway"" to emphasize a compromise."
