"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is way too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $130? It's still a great deal for a product like this.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's do $125.  I think that's a fair compromise.",125.0,Alice,5,
