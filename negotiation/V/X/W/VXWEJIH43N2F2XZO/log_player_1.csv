Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth $180, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $165. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 165
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a little.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offered price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($120). This might seem unreasonable, but it's important to remember you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150.
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the high price without explicitly revealing your bottom line.  This allows Bob to decline without feeling like he's lowballing you if he finds the price too high.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario! You get $165, which is more than your minimum and John's offer.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to go down to $150 (John's price) and still profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** You lose nothing and sell to John for your guaranteed $150."
