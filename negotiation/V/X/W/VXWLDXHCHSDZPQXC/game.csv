"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1250000 is still out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $900000. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900000 is still too low for me.  Let's try $1000000.  I'm confident this product will bring you significant value, and this price is a good compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that this product might not be worth the investment for me. However, I'm still interested in making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $950000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
