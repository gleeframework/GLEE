"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $18000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $16000, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",16000.0,Bob,4,
