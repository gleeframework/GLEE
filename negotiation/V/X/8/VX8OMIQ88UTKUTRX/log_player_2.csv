"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this product, which I believe has immense value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $900,000, while John wants $1,200,000. 
* **You can still make a profit:** Even though you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000), you're still getting it for less than your maximum budget ($1,200,000). 

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $300,000 compared to buying from John."
