Round 2
Bob's offer:

""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. While $975,000 is closer, I'm still looking for something a bit higher. Would you consider $1,010,000?  It's a small adjustment for a product of this caliber."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting close. To make this deal happen quickly, how about we settle at $990,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

While I could push for more, accepting $990,000 is a strong outcome. It's significantly more than my minimum ($800,000) and we're getting close to the later rounds where Bob's willingness to negotiate further might decrease."
