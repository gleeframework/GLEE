"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget.  He's better off trying to negotiate a lower price or buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. I understand your budget, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

$13,500 is still too high for Bob. He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still above what I can afford. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
