"Alice, that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. I understand your budget, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still above what I can afford. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
