Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's a bit higher than my minimum value but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to pay this much!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price of $140. Let's see if I can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $135. It's a bit closer to his offer, but still leaves some room for me to make a profit.  Hopefully, he'll see that it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $132.  While I was hoping for a bit more, it's still a good price and better than selling to John.  It's time to move on to the next deal!"
