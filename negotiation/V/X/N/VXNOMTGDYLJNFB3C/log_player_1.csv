**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving in $25,000 increments and is unlikely to significantly deviate from this pattern. Even if he were to meet in the middle in a future round, the highest likely offer from him is around ~$962,500. This is substantially lower than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000.  It makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob short and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
