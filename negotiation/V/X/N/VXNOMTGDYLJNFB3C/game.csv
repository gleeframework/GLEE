"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,050,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. I'd like to counteroffer at $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite a ways off from a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down slightly, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway once more.",900000.0,Bob,6,
