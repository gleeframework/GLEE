"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for your business.  My initial price is $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is quite high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While your price is still lower than I'm comfortable with,  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. To be honest,  $1,000,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider something closer to $750,000? That would make things much easier.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply not a feasible price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings, and it's a price I believe is fair for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
