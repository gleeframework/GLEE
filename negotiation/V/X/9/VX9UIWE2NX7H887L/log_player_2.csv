Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is quite high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While your price is still lower than I'm comfortable with,  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. To be honest,  $1,000,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider something closer to $750,000? That would make things much easier."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply not a feasible price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings, and it's a price I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, she's unlikely to reach our target price of $800,000 or lower. John offers a guaranteed price that meets our needs, so it's time to cut negotiations with Alice short and secure the deal with John."
