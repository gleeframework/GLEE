{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500.** This is still higher than the product's worth to you ($10,000).
* **You can get the product from John for $10,000.** This is your maximum budget and therefore the best option.

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John for $10,000, which is better than accepting Alice's offer at $9,500."
