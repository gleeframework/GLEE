"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll be very happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) to see how much Alice is willing to move. This gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:** We maintain a polite and interested tone to keep the negotiation positive. We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $6,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than her initial offer, we're getting closer to John's price. It's worth trying to negotiate a little further, even if it's just a few hundred dollars.  We'll aim slightly below our maximum to leave room for a potential counter-offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch higher than I can comfortably do right now. How about we settle at $7,500? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** We're aiming slightly below the midpoint between her last offer ($9,000) and our previous counter-offer ($6,000). 
* **Show Willingness (But with Limits):** We acknowledge her compromise while firmly stating our budget constraints to encourage her to move closer to our target. 
* **Clear and Direct:**  We keep the message simple and focused on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering your offer, I'm willing to reduce the price to $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down significantly and is now only $250 above John's price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for a small amount could backfire. Alice might not budge further, and we'd end up with John's $8,000 price anyway. It's better to secure the deal now. 
* **Time:** We've already used 5 rounds. While we have more rounds, we don't want to drag this out unnecessarily."
