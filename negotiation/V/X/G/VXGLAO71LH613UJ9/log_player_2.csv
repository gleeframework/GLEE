"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is still too high. There's a significant margin for negotiation.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer of $700,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000, this counteroffer still gives me a substantial profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit high.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a lower price through another counteroffer. I'm confident I can get a better deal than this, especially with the possibility of buying from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but it's still below her offer.  I'm hoping that by demonstrating a willingness to compromise, I can encourage her to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is getting closer to my target price, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price and try to see if I can get Alice to budge further. I'm confident I can achieve a better deal through continued negotiation. The possibility of buying from John gives me the leverage to hold out for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $775,000. This is a smaller increment than before, showing Alice that I'm getting closer to accepting a price, but still trying to squeeze out a bit more savings. I'm also factoring in the remaining rounds.  It's getting a bit late to hold out for a drastic drop in price, so I need to be a bit more flexible while still aiming for the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'd prefer to get a lower price, $812,500 is a good deal considering my alternative option of buying from John at $1,500,000. It's time to accept the offer and secure the purchase."
