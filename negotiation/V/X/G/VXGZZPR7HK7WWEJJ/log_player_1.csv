Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds immense value for you, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at $1,999,999. This offer stands for 24 hours. "", 
""product_price"": 1999999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a very high price ($1,999,999) sets a strong anchor. While seemingly outrageous, it establishes the perceived value at a much higher level than Bob might have initially considered.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By adding a 24-hour time limit and framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" we introduce a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly. 
* **Fallback Option:** We know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, providing a safety net. Our goal is to maximize profit, so aiming high with Bob is strategically sound. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy relies on psychological tactics. It's impossible to guarantee Bob will accept this offer, but it gives us the best chance to secure the highest possible profit."
