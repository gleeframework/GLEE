You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is $120:**  This is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from John is $150:**  This is more expensive. 

Even though you can get a better deal with John, Alice's offer is still a good deal for you and saves you money."
