"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and hopefully, we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your business.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's unique value and my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the potential of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
