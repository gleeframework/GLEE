"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a final price closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value reinforces its worth in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""starting price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal your willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and hopefully, we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value but still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  While he's showing some willingness to negotiate, you have room to maneuver. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  Accepting immediately might signal you're willing to go much lower.
* **Guide the Negotiation Upwards:**  Your counteroffer will aim to steer the price closer to your target. 

You have the security of John's offer, so you can afford to negotiate strategically with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your business.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's unique value and my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Appreciate:** Recognizing Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate builds rapport.
* **Hold Firm (But Show Flexibility):** While you're lowering your price, the decrease is substantial enough to demonstrate movement but not so drastic that it weakens your position.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Emphasize the product's potential to benefit Bob's business, justifying the higher price.
* **Signal Cooperation:**  Phrases like ""move this forward"" and ""mutually beneficial agreement""  reinforce your interest in closing a deal.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while steering the price closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the potential of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, accepting now provides several advantages:

* **Secures a Profitable Deal:**  You're guaranteed a significant profit margin above your minimum. 
* **Reduces Risk:**  Continuing negotiations introduces the chance that Bob might lower his offer or that the deal could fall through.
* **Saves Time and Effort:**  Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy and complex further negotiation rounds.

Although John's offer is slightly higher, the certainty and speed of closing the deal with Bob at this favorable price outweigh the potential for a marginally better outcome with John."
