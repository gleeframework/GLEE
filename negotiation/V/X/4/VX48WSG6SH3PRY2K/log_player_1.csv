Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high offer of $1,500,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be much closer to your desired outcome.
* **Value Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" to justify the high asking price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  It's unknown how aggressively Bob is willing to negotiate. There's a chance this high offer could turn him off. 
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive opening might be preferable. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit by leveraging your strong position while acknowledging the potential need for negotiation."
