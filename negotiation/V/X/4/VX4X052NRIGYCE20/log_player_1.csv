Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit, while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 is a good starting point to see if he's willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9500. This is still a good profit for me, but it also shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price, and it's a good deal for me.  While I could keep negotiating, I'd rather secure the sale and avoid further back-and-forth. Selling to John for $12,000 would be ideal, but it's not guaranteed, so accepting Bob's offer is the best choice right now."
