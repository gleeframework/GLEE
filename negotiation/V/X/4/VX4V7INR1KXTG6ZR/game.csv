"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $105. I'll meet you at $107.50. That's the best I can do. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,
