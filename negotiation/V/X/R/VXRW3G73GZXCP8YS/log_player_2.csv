"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good start, but $12,000 is still a bit too high. You want to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to your $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$11,500 is still a bit too high. You're getting closer to your goal, but you want to see if Alice is willing to go even lower. Let's try another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go to $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $11250. This is a great compromise that still allows me to earn a fair profit while giving you a good deal on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're getting closer to your goal, but $11,250 is still a bit too high. You want to see if Alice is willing to go even lower. Let's make another counteroffer to see if you can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,250 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $11,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is a tough sell for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $11100. This is as low as I can go while still making a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached the point where Alice is only willing to come down to $11,100, which is still higher than your ideal price of $10,000.  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that Alice will drop her price further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $10,000 and save yourself some money."
