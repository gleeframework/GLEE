"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",10500.0,Alice,3,
