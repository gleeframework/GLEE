"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can you meet me in the middle at $850000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. $850000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $925000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $925000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $825000. Can you consider this price?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's aim for a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $875000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but $875000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. Can you consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,6,
