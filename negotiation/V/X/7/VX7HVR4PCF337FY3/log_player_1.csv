Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties, starting with a significantly higher price allows room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring Bias:**  By presenting a high initial price, we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if we started lower.
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,000,000. This safety net allows us to be bolder in our initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  We expect Bob to negotiate, and we're prepared to adjust our price accordingly. The key is to find a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the deal goes through."
