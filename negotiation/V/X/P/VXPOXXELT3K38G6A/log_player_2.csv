```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $165. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While Alice's offer of $165 is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $165 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $140. This is a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still above my budget of $120. I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $120.  This guarantees I get the product within my budget and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
