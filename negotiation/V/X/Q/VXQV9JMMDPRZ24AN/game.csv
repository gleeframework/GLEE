"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This way, both of us can walk away with a deal that works for us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
