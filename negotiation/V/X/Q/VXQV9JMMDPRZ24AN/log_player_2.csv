"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm starting with a price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The product is worth $10,000 to Bob. Alice's first offer is $11,000, which is more than Bob's value.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $10,250 is closer to Bob's value, it's still above his target. Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate will give Bob a chance to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This way, both of us can walk away with a deal that works for us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
