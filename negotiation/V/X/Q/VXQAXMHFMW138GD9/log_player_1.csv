Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it's something you'd find immensely valuable, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit you.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation without going over. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still likely settle on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 

This strategy aims for the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
