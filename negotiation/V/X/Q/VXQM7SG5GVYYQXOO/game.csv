"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to consider this price for a limited time.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product! While I'm definitely interested, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.
