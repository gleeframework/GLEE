"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about we settle on $140? I'm sure we can find a happy medium.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $152.50. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

"I'm glad we're still in negotiation, Bob! I'm willing to make another small concession. I can offer it to you for $151. It's a slight increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",151.0,Alice,7,
