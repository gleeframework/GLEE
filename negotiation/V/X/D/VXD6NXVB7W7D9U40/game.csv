"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value it holds for me.  However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify right now.  I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for the product. This represents a significant step closer to your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to my initial offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll meet you halfway between $700,000 and $725,000, which brings the price down to $712,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",712500.0,Alice,5,

This represents a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",680000.0,Bob,6,
