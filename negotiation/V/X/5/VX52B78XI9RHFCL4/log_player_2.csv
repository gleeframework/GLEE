Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, but her latest offer of $11,250 is a reasonable compromise.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  You're still saving $3,750 compared to John's offer.
* **Reaching a Limit:** Alice has indicated this is her lowest price. Further haggling might be fruitless and risk the deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time. Accepting now secures the product without further delay."
