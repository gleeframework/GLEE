"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure it will be a valuable asset to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to maximize my potential profit.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price is still below my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation and compromise. 
* **Positive and Enthusiastic Tone:**  I'm aiming to build a rapport with Bob to increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is unwilling to meet my initial price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Opportunity Cost of Selling to John:** Selling to John now would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Seeking a Mutually Beneficial Solution:** I'm emphasizing the need to find a solution that benefits both of us, fostering a cooperative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe we can find a better solution. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $1,450,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, it's still slightly below.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Potential for a Deal:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price.  I want to see if we can bridge the remaining gap.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, I believe there's a chance I can get a slightly higher price from Bob. I want to explore this possibility before selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. $1,450,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and close this deal at $1,475,000.  That way, we both get a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 1475000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and meet him halfway.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, appealing to his sense of equity.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm suggesting that we close the deal at this price, indicating a desire to finalize the transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in coming down on the price, Alice. However, I am still not able to meet you at $1,475,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,425,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob might lead to further concessions on my part, potentially pushing the final price even lower.
* **Guaranteeing My Minimum:**  Selling to John now guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable value and a safe bet given the current negotiation trajectory. 

While it would be ideal to reach a deal with Bob,  the risk of further negotiation and the time constraint make selling to John the most logical decision at this point."
