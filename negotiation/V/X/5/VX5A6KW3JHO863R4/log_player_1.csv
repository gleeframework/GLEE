"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I want to keep the conversation friendly and open to a deal. 
* **Setting Expectations:** I'm reminding Bob of his interest in the product to hopefully motivate him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.
* **I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher.**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially close the deal at a price closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is a last resort.** I would only sell to John if I'm confident I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm really looking to get closer to $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to move a little closer to that figure."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm dropping my price slightly, showing flexibility while still holding firm to a decent profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially motivating him to meet me in the middle.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, suggesting that we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000 and closer to my initial target of $12,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and I risk losing a decent deal. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already in round 4, and I need to be mindful of the limited number of rounds.

This offer provides a good balance between securing a profitable sale and avoiding unnecessary risk."
