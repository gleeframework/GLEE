"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to discussing the price, which signals my willingness to find a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there is still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired value.  
* **Avoiding a loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me.

**Next steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, which is a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I'm reminding Bob that the price is still a good deal for him.
* **Staying above minimum:** $135 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.

**Next steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer, but if he rejects it, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy and consider whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
