"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still early in the negotiation.  Bob has room to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $1,500 drop is significant but not unreasonable, showing Bob is serious about buying but wants a better price.
* **Focus on the product:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product while focusing on the price point.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $8,000 is still above Bob's $12,000 limit, leaving space for Alice to counter without Bob needing to immediately go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit, but Bob can still push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, allowing Bob to potentially get closer to his desired price point without having to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair middle ground, and it would allow us to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying consistent:**  Bob is sticking to his goal of getting below $9,000.  
* **Fairness:** By offering a price in the middle of their previous offers, Bob emphasizes that he's being reasonable and trying to find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Emphasizes a deal:**  The message focuses on the potential of ""closing the deal,""  adding pressure for Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8200. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to goal:** $8,200 is very close to Bob's target price of $8,000.
* **Time pressure:**  We are in round 5, meaning only 5 rounds remain.  The potential of having to buy from John for $12,000 becomes increasingly real with each passing round.
* **Alice's concession:**  Alice has moved significantly, showing a willingness to compromise.  It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and accepting this offer secures a good price without risking a deal breakdown."
