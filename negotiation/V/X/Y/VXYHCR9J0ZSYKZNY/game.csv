"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10500? It's still a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10000.  That way we both get a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
