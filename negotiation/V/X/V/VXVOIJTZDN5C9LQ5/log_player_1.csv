"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a very reasonable price.  Considering its value and potential, I believe $1,800,000 is a fair starting point. Let's discuss."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, however, and I'm prepared to offer a lower price.  How about $1,400,000? This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our interests.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, but $900,000 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, though. How about $1,150,000? It's a significant reduction from my previous offer and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1150000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $950000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I've only got 4 rounds left.  It's not worth risking losing the sale completely to try and squeeze out a few more dollars.  Selling to John guarantees me a decent return, and I can always try to negotiate with Bob again in the future if the opportunity arises."
