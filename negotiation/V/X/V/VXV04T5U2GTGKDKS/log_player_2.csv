"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe will significantly enhance your business operations. Given its high value and potential impact on your endeavors, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This represents a substantial savings compared to its market value of $15,000, making it an exceptional opportunity for you. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to proceed with this exclusive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, you know you have another option with John.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price than $12,000, especially since Alice is clearly exaggerating the market value.  By rejecting this offer, you open the door to potentially saving even more money."
