"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is good, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This still reflects the true value of what's being offered.  Are you open to discussing this further?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  This offer represents a significant investment from my side while acknowledging the value of the product.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
