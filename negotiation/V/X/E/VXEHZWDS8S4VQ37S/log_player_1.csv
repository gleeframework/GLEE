"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a truly valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to be very beneficial for your company. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob and my own minimum.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not able to go as low as $900,000.  This product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will generate a lot of value for your company.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. My counteroffer is $1,050,000.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so my counteroffer is $975000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a great deal considering the product's value to Bob. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still significantly lower than the true value of this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise one more time, so my counteroffer is $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is close to the price offered by John, it's still below my minimum desired price. It's worth continuing negotiations with Bob, as he has shown a willingness to compromise, and I'm still confident we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement. There are four rounds remaining, and we can still increase the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle once more. I'm offering $987,500 as a final compromise. It's a fair price that allows you to acquire a valuable asset while still ensuring I receive a decent return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 987500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement. My counteroffer is $920000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to stretch my budget to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much further. Although $920,000 is closer to my minimum, it still isn't a great deal.  With only two rounds remaining, there isn't enough time to push for a higher price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a sale and a decent return on my investment."
