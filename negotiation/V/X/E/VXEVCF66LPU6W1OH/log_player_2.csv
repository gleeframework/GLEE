It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You have room to lower the price before it becomes more advantageous to buy from John."

Alice's offer:

You are still $150,000 above your desired price and $150,000 below John's offer. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before you decide to buy from John."
