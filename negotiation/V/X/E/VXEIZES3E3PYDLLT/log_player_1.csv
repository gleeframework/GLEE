Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit beyond John's guaranteed $800,000 offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain. 
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high price without being overly aggressive.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Deal with Bob:** The offered price is attractive to Bob, potentially leading to a quick agreement.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** If Bob counters, there's space to negotiate down slightly while remaining above John's offer."
