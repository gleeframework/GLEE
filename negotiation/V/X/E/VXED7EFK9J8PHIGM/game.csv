"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm only willing to pay $8500.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $11000 might still be a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $9000? It's a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
