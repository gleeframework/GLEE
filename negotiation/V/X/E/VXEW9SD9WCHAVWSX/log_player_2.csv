Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, there is still room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $105.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $105, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $107.50. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $107.5, which is closer to your desired price of $105 and still within your budget of $120. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and saves you money compared to buying from John."
