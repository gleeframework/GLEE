I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is the price I'd receive from John if Bob rejects the offer, so it's in my best interest to try and sell to Bob at this price. 

While the product is only worth $1,200,000 to Bob, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more to secure the product. If he rejects, I can always sell it to John for my desired price."
