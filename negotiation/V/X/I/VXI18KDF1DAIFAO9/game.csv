"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as you've already determined its worth to be $1,500,000. Let's strike a deal that benefits both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,350,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,390,000 as a final offer. This is a very fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's close this deal.",1390000.0,Alice,5,
