"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,350,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000, but I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
