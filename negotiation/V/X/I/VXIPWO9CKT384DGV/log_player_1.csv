"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Gauge Bob's Reaction:** This initial offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how much negotiating power you might have. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $8,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Bob's offer of $8,200 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than his perceived value of $10,000. There's likely room for him to increase his offer.
* **Don't Settle Too Early:** Accepting the first counteroffer might signal that you're willing to concede quickly, potentially leaving money on the table. It's early in the negotiation, so it's worth pushing back a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $8,200 is significantly below what I had in mind. This product offers you a lot of value, and I believe a price closer to $9,000 is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to consider that?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** While we're rejecting Bob's offer, we're showing a willingness to negotiate by coming down from our initial price. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Reiterating the product's value to Bob can help justify the higher price point.
* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:** $9,000 is still a significant markup from your minimum, but it's a more reasonable counteroffer considering Bob's initial bid."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $8,500 is the most I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $8,500 is a solid profit above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **""Meeting Halfway"" Psychology:** Bob's framing suggests this is likely his final offer. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  While you could try to squeeze out a bit more, closing the deal now ensures you get paid promptly."
