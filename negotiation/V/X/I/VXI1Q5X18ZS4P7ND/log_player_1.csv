Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly.  I'm asking for $18,000, which reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding both their valuations.
* **Confident language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without being overly aggressive.  This framing aims to make Bob feel like he's getting something valuable. 
* **No mention of John:**  Alice avoids mentioning her backup offer to maintain a strong negotiating position.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:** This offer assumes Bob might be willing to pay a premium. If Alice suspects Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start slightly lower (but still above $12,000) to leave more room for negotiation. 
* **Risk tolerance:** A higher initial offer carries the risk of Bob immediately rejecting it.  Alice needs to weigh this risk against the potential reward of a higher sale price."
