"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I think it can be a real game-changer for your business. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, I must be candid; $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
