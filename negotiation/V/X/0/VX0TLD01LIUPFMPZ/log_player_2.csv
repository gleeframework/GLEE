# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice values the product at $1,000,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within your budget and represents a good deal. You can potentially negotiate further, but there is a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and you may end up paying $1,200,000 to John. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
