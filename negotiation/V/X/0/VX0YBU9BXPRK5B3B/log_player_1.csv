Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and confident tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to make it more appealing. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not setting a hard price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer.
* **Keeping John as a backup:** I'm keeping John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $12,500 is still less than my $15,000 minimum.
* **I have a better option:** I have John who's willing to pay my minimum. There's no need to settle for less.
* **Negotiating room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to my desired amount.

**Next Step:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Middle ground:** I'm proposing $13,500, which is a midpoint between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the benefits he'll get from the product to justify the price.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion.

**Next step:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll sell him the product. If he rejects, I'll decide whether to lower my price further or sell to John for $15,000."
