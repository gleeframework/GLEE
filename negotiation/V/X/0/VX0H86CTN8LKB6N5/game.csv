,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value is considerably higher than $1,100,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects a more accurate market price considering its unique benefits.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement.  Let's work together to bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
