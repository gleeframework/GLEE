"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This price reflects the value I'm bringing and allows for some room for you to make a profit.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
