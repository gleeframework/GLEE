,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,075,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiations. $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both benefit from this transaction.  What do you say?",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this price is fair and reasonable considering the value of the product to me.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,060,000 simply isn't enough for me. However, to show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,070,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement. Let's make this happen.",1070000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,070,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $1,055,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",1055000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is getting close to the wire, but $1,055,000 is still too low for me.  I've gone down quite a bit, and this is my final offer: $1,065,000.  This is the best I can do, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's close this deal.",1065000.0,Alice,9,
