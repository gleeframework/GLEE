Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, and I would like to propose a counteroffer. How about we settle on $890,000 for the product? I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our interests.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is getting closer to my target price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that we'll reach a stalemate and I'll have to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product for a reasonable price."
