Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
