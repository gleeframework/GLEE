"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think that buying the product from John for $1,500,000 might be a better option for me. Can you really meet me at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, but let's be realistic. You know this product is worth significantly more than $1,200,000 to you. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,275,000.  Take it or leave it.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
