Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think that buying the product from John for $1,500,000 might be a better option for me. Can you really meet me at $1,200,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is bluffing. He's trying to use John's offer as leverage, but his offer actually went down from $1,250,000 to $1,200,000. This indicates he's more interested than he's letting on. It's time to push back firmly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, but let's be realistic. You know this product is worth significantly more than $1,200,000 to you. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,275,000.  Take it or leave it."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling the bluff:** By reiterating the $1,275,000 offer and making it firm, we're showing Bob that we see through his tactic and are serious about this price.
* **Time pressure:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob needs to know that time is a factor.  
* **Confidence:** By appearing confident and unwilling to budge further, we might persuade Bob that this is his best chance to acquire the product."
