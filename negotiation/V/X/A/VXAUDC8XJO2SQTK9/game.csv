"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $160? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $145. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $155? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $145, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $145?",145.0,Bob,6,
