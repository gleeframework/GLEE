"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $950000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is too low. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still interested in purchasing the product, but I can only commit to $1050000. I believe this brings us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $1,050,000 is still below what I'm comfortable accepting, and I'm not yet ready to settle for the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement soon.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. I am willing to consider $1065000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $1,065,000 is a good deal and I'm running out of time. It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds."
