Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $1,400,000 is my top price. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,850,000, which would be $1,625,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're not at a point where accepting his offer is better than selling to John. We're still in a position to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $1,700,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, which is $50,000 less than your last offer. Can we finalize the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has come up significantly in price, and we've managed to stay above our minimum acceptable price. Accepting $1,700,000 at this point is a strong outcome and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a worse deal or losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
