"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $880000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $850000 to you, and I'm willing to give you a discount, but not quite that much.",880000.0,Alice,3,
