"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
