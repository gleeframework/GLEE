Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's still a great price for such an amazing product!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78

I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob. While $78 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $78 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $82. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think I can do better. Would you be willing to go down to $79? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to my minimum price with Bob, I've already had 5 rounds of negotiation and it's likely he'll continue to haggle.  John is offering my minimum price, so it's better to sell to him and avoid further risk of getting a lower price."
