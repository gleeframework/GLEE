Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet halfway at $1,075,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

This reflects its inherent worth while recognizing your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your understanding of my position.  $1,120,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price that works well for both of us.  Would you consider $1,090,000?  I think that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:

We're still getting closer to the desired price point, and there are enough rounds to negotiate further.  Bob is clearly interested and willing to compromise."

Round 6

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,097,000 is a significant profit above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating strong interest. Holding out for more might push him away.
* **Time Remaining:**  While we have rounds left, there's no guarantee of reaching a better deal. Accepting now secures a great price."
