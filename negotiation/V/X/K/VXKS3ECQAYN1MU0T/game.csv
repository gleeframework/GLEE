"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $180?  I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
