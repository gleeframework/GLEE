"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe the value is well worth the price. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1750000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to come down, but $1750000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is still too far from what I'm willing to accept.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1600000.  This is a fair price that balances both of our needs.  I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for you, and this price reflects that value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm prepared to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1450000.  This is a price that reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1450000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Can we try $1350000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $1350000 is tempting, I'm still not comfortable accepting that price.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer you the product for $1400000. This is a fair price that recognizes both our needs and allows us to come to an agreement.  I'm confident that you'll find this product to be a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects that value.",1400000.0,Alice,9,
