"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe the value is well worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I can always come down.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $2,000,000 is a significant amount above my minimum, giving me flexibility to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question invites Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to hold out for a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me an opportunity to send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,750,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a counter that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a price that undervalues my product.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Compromise:** I've lowered my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm inviting Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to come down, but $1750000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $1,400,000 is still below what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still too far from what I'm willing to accept.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that balances both of our needs.  I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for you, and this price reflects that value."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates my flexibility and commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to further justify my offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum price. I believe there's a good chance he'll accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I have more room to negotiate in the remaining rounds. Selling to John at this point would be a less profitable choice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to take the $1,300,000, I believe I can still get a better price, especially since I have four rounds left. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. Selling to John would be a less profitable option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm prepared to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,450,000.  This is a price that reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I acknowledge Bob's position, but I reiterate my need for a fair price.
* **Middle Ground:**  I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  This signals my willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Positive Outlook:** I end with a positive statement to keep the negotiation amicable. 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a possible deal. My counteroffer is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm serious about finding a solution. With only three rounds left, I need to make a decision that balances the potential for a better deal with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1450000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Can we try $1350000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $1,350,000 is still below what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob. I have two rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $1,350,000 is tempting, I'm still not comfortable accepting that price.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price that recognizes both our needs and allows us to come to an agreement.  I'm confident that you'll find this product to be a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects that value."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

* **Fair Price:** I emphasize that this is a fair price for both parties.
* **Positive Outlook:** I end with a positive statement to maintain a positive tone.

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer, and it's the closest I'm willing to go to Bob's offer. I'm still above my minimum but I'm taking into account that this is the penultimate round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1300000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $1,500,000.  Since I'm unable to negotiate further, it's best to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the most profitable option at this point."
