Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $120 is more than Bob values the product at, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $135 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $128, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?
