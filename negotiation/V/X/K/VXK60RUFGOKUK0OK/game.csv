"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not sure about $105. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,95.0,Bob,4,
