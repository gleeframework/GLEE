"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. However,  $11,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to agree on $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I see we're getting closer. While $11,750 is tempting, I need to be closer to $12,000 for this to make sense. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,875?",11875.0,Alice,5,
