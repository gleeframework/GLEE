"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at a price of $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,500 is still a bit steep. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $10,750. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both make a little effort.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,200. I believe this reflects a fair price for the value it will bring you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're coming down in price, which I appreciate.  However, $11,200 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,900.  Let's work together to find a number that works for both of us.",10900.0,Bob,6,
