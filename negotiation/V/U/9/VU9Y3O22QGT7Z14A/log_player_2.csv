"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe you'll really value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($1,200,000).  Bob can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John.  

Here's the breakdown:

* **Buying from Alice:**  $1,400,000 (cost) - $1,200,000 (Alice's value) = $200,000 profit for Alice
* **Buying from John:** $1,500,000 (cost) - $1,200,000 (Alice's value) = $300,000 profit for John

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob forces Alice to take a lower profit, and he can potentially negotiate a better price with John in the future."
