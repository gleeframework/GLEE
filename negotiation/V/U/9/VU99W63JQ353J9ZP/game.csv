"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1700000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I propose a counteroffer of $1650000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope it's more in line with your budget.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
