"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives you more leverage to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
``` 
I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully forces Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is coming down, but I'm not ready to commit yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
``` 

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise but still trying to stay below $400,000.  This shows I'm taking Alice's offer seriously while also holding firm to my desire for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is going up in price. I'm not going to let her dictate the terms. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get her back down to a more acceptable level."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $400,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer.  Hopefully, she'll recognize that this is a fair price and we can finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is back to her original price. This is a clear signal that she is unwilling to budge further. With only three rounds remaining, the risk of getting a better deal is too high. It's better to buy from John at $1,000,000 to guarantee the purchase rather than risk losing the product altogether."
