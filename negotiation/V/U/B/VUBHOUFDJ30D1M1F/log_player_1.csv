"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation. I'm also leaving myself room to adjust my offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price. This shows flexibility while also attempting to secure a more favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum price.  While I could continue negotiating and risk getting a lower offer from Bob, there's no guarantee he'll increase his offer further.  Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum value and saves time."
