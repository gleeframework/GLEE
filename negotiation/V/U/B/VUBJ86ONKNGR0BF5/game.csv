"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is generous, I'm confident this product's unique value warrants a higher price.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the value you'd be gaining.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I would be gaining. I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
