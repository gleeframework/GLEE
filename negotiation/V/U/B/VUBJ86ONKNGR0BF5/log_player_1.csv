Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
