Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll aim to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer it to him for $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent offer. Since I value the product at $10,000 or more, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to my minimum value of $10,000. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $11,500.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $11,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll offer it to him for $12,500.

Let's say I'll offer it to him for $11,750.
