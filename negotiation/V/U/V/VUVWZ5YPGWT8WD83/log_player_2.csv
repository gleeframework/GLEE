**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above Bob's budget.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects a significant discount from my original asking price and is still a fair price considering the product's value.  I'm confident this price will be a good investment for your business.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While it is a significant reduction from the initial price, Bob is trying to save as much money as possible and should continue to negotiate.  He can potentially reach a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $900,000 is still significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To finalize this, I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  Let's work together to get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer to his budget.  He can still save a significant amount of money compared to Alice's original asking price.  Considering the potential for further negotiations to take longer and potentially fail, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer.  There's a good chance that rejecting the offer will only lead to more back-and-forth, potentially increasing the price again or leading to a dead end."
