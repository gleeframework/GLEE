"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $107.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with.",107.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we try $105? I'm willing to pay that, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about $106? It's a small step up from your offer, but it allows me to stay within my desired range. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",106.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $106. How about $103? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget.",103.0,Bob,6,
