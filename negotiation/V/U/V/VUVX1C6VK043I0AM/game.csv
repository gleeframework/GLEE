"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering your product's value and my budget. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in the product. However, we're not willing to go as low as $800,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our costs. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price closer to $825,000. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and still stay within my budget. I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand your budget constraints, but we're still not willing to go as low as $825,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer $850,000, but we're not willing to go any lower. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our costs.
