"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $13,000 for the product.  This still gives you a good deal, considering the value to you. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $12,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - how about $13,250? It's a fair compromise, and still leaves you with a good margin.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but $12,750 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. That's a fair compromise, and leaves you with a significant profit. Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think we can do better. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,900?",12900.0,Bob,8,
