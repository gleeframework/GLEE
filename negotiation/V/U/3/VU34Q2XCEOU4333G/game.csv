"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $950000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1050000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit too far apart.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
