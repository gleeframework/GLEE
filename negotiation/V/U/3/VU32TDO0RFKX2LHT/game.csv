"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to that.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there. $900,000 is closer, but I need to get a bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,5,
