"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what John is asking, there's still room to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120, but still above her value of $80. This gives Alice some room to negotiate, but also shows I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial price, but $130 is still too high. I'm willing to pay up to $150 for the product, but I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $110. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal value. It's also possible that Alice will be more willing to accept a counteroffer closer to her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is close to my maximum value of $150. While I'd prefer to pay less, further negotiation might not yield a better result, and I risk losing the product to another buyer. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a price within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
