"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of significant value to your operations. I'm sure you understand the importance of discretion, so I can't reveal specific details about the product just yet. However, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Please let me know your decision.  ",1150000.0,Alice,1,
