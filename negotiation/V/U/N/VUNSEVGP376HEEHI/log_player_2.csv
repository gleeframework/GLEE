"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation, but is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, making it a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,120,000 is slightly higher than her original offer. While it's still better than John's price, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation. I believe there's still potential to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,075,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway. It's still a good deal for me, as it's below the price I'd pay to John, and it leaves some room for Alice to accept without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to my maximum price, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  While there's a chance I could get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, it's becoming increasingly risky.  The likelihood of Alice budging further is decreasing, and I could end up stuck with a price close to John's.  To avoid the risk and secure the product, I'm going to buy from John at $1,200,000. It's not the ideal price, but it's within my budget and guarantees I'll get the product."
