Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

You can get the product for $120 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. I'm hoping to see if she's willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'm going to offer $80.  This is a small increase from my previous offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully gets us closer to an agreement."
