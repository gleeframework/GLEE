"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be of great use to you. This price is a fair reflection of its value and allows for a substantial profit for you. Please let me know your decision by [date/time]. If you decline, I will be selling to another buyer at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:**  Her statement about selling to another buyer at a lower price is a tactic to pressure you. It's unlikely she'll find a buyer easily at a price closer to her $800,000 valuation.
* **Room for negotiation:** You have a strong alternative in John's offer. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for potential counter-offers and a better price.
 
Let's see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."
