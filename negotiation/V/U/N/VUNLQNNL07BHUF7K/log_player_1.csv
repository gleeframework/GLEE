Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring we get more than John's offer if he declines. 
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
