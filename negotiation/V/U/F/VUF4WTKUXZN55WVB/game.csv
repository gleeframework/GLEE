"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a great deal.  While $1,000,000 is below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,150,000.  This gives you a significant savings, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Alice,3,
