{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering Bob the full $12,000 I value the product at.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I know John will pay that price, so I have a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get closer to $12,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering Bob $11,500.  This is a compromise,  meeting him halfway between his offer and my original price. Hopefully, he sees the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,200 is a better offer than his last one, I'm still not happy with that price.  It's close enough to John's price that I think I can get a better offer from Bob. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to offer Bob $11,400. It's just a little lower than his last offer but still a reasonable compromise. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,100 is getting dangerously close to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a much higher offer from him. I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer."
