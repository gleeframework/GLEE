"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice's new offer of $12,500 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his target. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. John is offering a better price, but Bob might be able to get an even better deal from Alice."
