Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's estimated value, giving me room to negotiate. I'm aiming for a good profit while keeping the negotiation open and inviting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I've also added a message to keep the conversation friendly and emphasize the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my absolute limit. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for the same price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the minimum I'm comfortable with, and I don't risk losing the sale entirely."
