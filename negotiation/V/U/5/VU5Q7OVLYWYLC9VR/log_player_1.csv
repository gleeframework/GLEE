Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Bob's offer:

I'm open to further negotiations and hope we can reach an agreement.

While Bob is making moves towards a more agreeable price, it's still too far from the minimum I'm willing to accept. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
