"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet closer to the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and propose a new counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm open to further negotiations and hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
