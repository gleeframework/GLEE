"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, and we're already in round 2.  It's more advantageous to accept his offer rather than risk further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
