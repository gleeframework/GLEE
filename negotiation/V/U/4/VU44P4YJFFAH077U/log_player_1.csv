"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.  It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to hold out for a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but still a good profit for me.  I hope Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a higher price. It's getting close to the point where selling to John might be a better option, but I want to see if I can get Bob to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is getting closer to John's offer, but it's still a significant profit for me. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the negotiations have been slow and Bob doesn't seem willing to meet me in the middle. I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will make the transaction smooth. This will allow me to move on to other opportunities and avoid further haggling."
