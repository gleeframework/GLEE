"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer creates room for negotiation. While $900,000 is a big jump, it's still within a reasonable range of both your budget and Alice's potential profit margin.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:** This counteroffer signals that you're serious about buying but want a fair deal. It gives Alice the opportunity to counter back, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you can always walk away and buy from John for $1,000,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to your desired price, it's still worthwhile to negotiate further. You're aiming for the best possible deal, and there's room to potentially save another $50,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shows Willingness to Negotiate:**  By countering with $925,000, you demonstrate flexibility and a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Targets a Fair Compromise:** The midpoint between your previous offer ($900,000) and her counteroffer ($950,000) represents a fair compromise.
* **Maintains Pressure:**  You're still below your walk-away price of $1,000,000, keeping the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to an agreement, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Let's see if we can meet at $950,000, and I'll consider it a done deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Further Savings:**  While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $950,000. The potential savings of another round of negotiation are small. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** By pushing too hard, you risk Alice becoming frustrated and walking away from the deal. 
* **Significant Savings Already Achieved:** You've already negotiated a $150,000 discount from Alice's initial offer. Accepting $950,000 is a solid win."
