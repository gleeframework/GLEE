"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to an agreement, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Let's see if we can meet at $950,000, and I'll consider it a done deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
