Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's guaranteed offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond Bob's initial valuation. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer before it goes to a guaranteed sale creates a sense of urgency and potential loss aversion for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my target is to get as close to $1,100,000 as possible, I am open to lowering the price slightly if Bob negotiates,  as long as it remains above my minimum of $1,200,000."
