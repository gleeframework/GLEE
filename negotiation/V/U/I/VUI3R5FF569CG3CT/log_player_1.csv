Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Could we possibly agree on $980,000?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate. Holding firm now might lead to a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here.  Let's make this happen - $1,000,000, and I'll throw in [Mention a small but valuable bonus related to the product or its use.  Example: free consultation, extended warranty, etc.]. This is a very strong offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** We're still well above John's backup offer, giving us negotiating power.
* **Psychological Price Point:** $1,000,000 is a clean number that can feel more agreeable.
* **Added Value:** The bonus sweetens the deal without significantly impacting our profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By calling it a ""very strong offer,"" we signal this is close to our limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's getting closer. I appreciate the added bonus. How about we finalize it at $990,000?  That's a strong signal I'm ready to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $990,000 is a significant profit margin, exceeding our minimum by a large amount.
* **Deal Momentum:** Bob is clearly signaling he's ready to buy, and further haggling over a relatively small amount risks losing the deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out longer adds uncertainty. Taking this deal now provides immediate value."
