"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $900000. I believe this product is valuable, but I'm not willing to go above that amount. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $975000? I think this is a fair middle ground.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $975000.
