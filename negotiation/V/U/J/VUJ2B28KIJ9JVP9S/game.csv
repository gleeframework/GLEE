"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the value I've attached to the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9500 for the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $10500 for the product. This is my best and final offer for now. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hesitant at $10500. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which is my final offer. This is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
