"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. This is still a good price for you, as you value the product at $8,000, and it's closer to my target. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy with the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,000 yet. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $9,200 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price.",9200.0,Alice,5,
