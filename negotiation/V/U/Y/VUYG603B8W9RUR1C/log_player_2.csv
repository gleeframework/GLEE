"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and John's offer.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John for $10,000."
