Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Minimum value:** I need to get at least $12,000 for the product, as that's what John is willing to pay.
* **Potential for higher value:**  I don't know what the product is worth to Bob, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than $12,000. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:** Offering $15,000 gives me a good chance of maximizing my profit while still being reasonable. 

This offer is a balance between aiming high and ensuring a decent outcome."
