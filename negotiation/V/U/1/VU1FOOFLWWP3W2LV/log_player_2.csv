Let's push Alice a little further. There's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not comfortable going below $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to budge from the $13,000 mark.  At this point, cutting our losses and accepting John's offer of $15,000 is the most strategically sound option.  While we could continue negotiating, the potential savings are not worth the risk of Alice sticking to her price, leaving us with a worse outcome."
