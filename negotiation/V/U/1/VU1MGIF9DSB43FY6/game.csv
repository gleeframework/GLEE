,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $130 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $90 is really pushing it, but I'm willing to let it go for $115. That's my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $115 is closer, I'm afraid $100 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,6,
