Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible (her guaranteed sale price to John).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might incentivize Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. How Bob responds to this offer will determine Alice's next move. She might need to lower the price slightly to secure the deal with Bob, but going below $1,200,000 still earns her more than selling to John."
