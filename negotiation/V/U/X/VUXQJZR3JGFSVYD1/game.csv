,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement if we keep talking.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it.  I'm hoping we can close this deal in the next few rounds.",975000.0,Bob,6,
