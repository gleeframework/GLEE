"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than Alice's valuation of $12,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget of $8,000 as possible. A counteroffer of $8,500 is a good starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum.  There's a chance Alice might come down further, and Bob still has rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget. A counteroffer of $9,000 shows that he's willing to negotiate, but still emphasizes his desire for a lower price. This should keep Alice motivated to reach an agreement, while leaving room for her to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Even though there are still a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Alice will drop her price enough to make the deal worthwhile for Bob.  It's now more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John at his guaranteed price of $8,000, ensuring a successful purchase within his budget."
