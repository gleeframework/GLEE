"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, he can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and negotiating.  There's a chance he can convince Alice to come down to a price closer to his desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He starts with a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in negotiating a lower price. This offer also leaves some room for negotiation and is still within Bob's desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,175,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he still has room to negotiate.  There is a chance Alice is willing to come down further to secure a deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for continued negotiation and the possibility of a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer while still keeping it below his maximum price. This counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate while also pushing for a lower price. This leaves some space for further negotiations and is closer to Alice's last offer, potentially signaling a closing of the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price point, but he's still within the negotiation zone.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue bargaining and potentially get a better deal. There's a chance Alice will be willing to go lower to finalize the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  He increases his offer to $1,125,000, which is a significant step up from his previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still maintaining his goal of getting the product for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,135,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,135,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,135,000, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,125,000.  At this point, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers.  There's a chance Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying more if he keeps rejecting and then has to buy from John for $1,000,000. It's a good deal for Bob, given his maximum budget, and he should accept to avoid potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
