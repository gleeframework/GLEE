"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,750? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,250. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to make another concession. How about $9,500, but I'll throw in a small bonus, worth $100, to sweeten the deal?",9500.0,Alice,5,
