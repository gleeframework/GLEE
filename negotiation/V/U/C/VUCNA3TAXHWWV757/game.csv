"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise considering my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $8,500? This would be a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
