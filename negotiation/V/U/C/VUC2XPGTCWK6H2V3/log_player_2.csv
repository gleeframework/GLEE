Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $775,000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to push for a lower price, Alice has stated this is her final offer.  There's a risk she won't budge, and I'd end up having to buy from John at the full $1,000,000.  Getting the product for $775,000 is a significant savings, and it's better to secure that deal now."
