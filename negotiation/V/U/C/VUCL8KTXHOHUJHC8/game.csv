"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well below what it's worth to me, and it's significantly better than your initial offer. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but I was hoping to land closer to $7,500. Would that be something you'd consider?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500?  This would be a good compromise, allowing you to get a great deal on the product and me to still make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
