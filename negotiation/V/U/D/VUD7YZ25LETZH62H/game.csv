"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $120?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my goal.",120.0,Bob,4,
