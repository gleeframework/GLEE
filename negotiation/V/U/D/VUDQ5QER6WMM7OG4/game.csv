"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,750?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings to you.",8900.0,Alice,5,
