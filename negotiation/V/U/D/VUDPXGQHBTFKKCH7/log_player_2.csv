Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my best offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $8,500. It's not worth continuing the negotiation as you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000, saving you $500."
