"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my best offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
