Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $100, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:**  Offering it at $125 ensures you make a profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value it provides,"" the message subtly encourages Bob to consider the product's worth beyond his initial valuation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob before resorting to selling to John."
