"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation strategy often involves starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for counteroffers and finding a middle ground. 
* **Significant Gap:** Alice's starting price is significantly higher than your $800,000 limit. By offering $600,000, you're aiming to bridge that gap quickly while still leaving yourself room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the safety net of John's offer at $800,000. This gives you leverage, as you can walk away from Alice's deal if it doesn't meet your needs."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than your $800,000 limit and John's offer. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer, given the current market."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:**  You're moving your offer up from $600,000 to $700,000, demonstrating willingness to compromise but also setting a firm boundary. 
* **Justification:** You're providing a reason for your counteroffer (""a bit of a stretch for my budget""), making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Market Reference:** Mentioning the ""current market"" subtly implies that you've researched prices and are aware of your options, even if you don't explicitly threaten to go with John's offer.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer tests Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to negotiate within a reasonable range, you might be able to secure a price closer to your goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budgetary concerns, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm selling. $700,000 is too low. Let's try this â€“ $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down, but $950,000 is still above your maximum price and John's offer. You're in a strong position to negotiate further since you have a viable alternative with John.  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $825,000?"",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price exactly halfway between your previous offer ($700,000) and Alice's current offer ($950,000). This strategy is often seen as fair and can help move negotiations along quickly.
* **Staying Above John's Offer (Slightly):** While you have the option to go with John at $800,000, offering slightly more shows Alice you're serious about making a deal with her.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is a good test to see how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she's not willing to accept a price close to this, it might be time to walk away and buy from John."
