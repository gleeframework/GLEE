"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing terms.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer, given the current market.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budgetary concerns, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm selling. $700,000 is too low. Let's try this â€“ $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
