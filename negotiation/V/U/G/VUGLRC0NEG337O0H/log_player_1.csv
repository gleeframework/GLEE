Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1300000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
