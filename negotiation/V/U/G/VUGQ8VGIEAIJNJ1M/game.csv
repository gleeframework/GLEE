"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $13,000. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. While I appreciate your product, I still believe that $9,000 is the maximum I can afford. I'm willing to negotiate further, so let's aim for $10,000. I hope this proposal works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
