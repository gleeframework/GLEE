"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is an aggressive opening, but I want to see if Bob is truly serious about purchasing the product.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better sense of his perceived value and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this stage. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a significant increase from his offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to reject his offer again and see if he's willing to increase his bid further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $850,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm showing flexibility and demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to increase his bid to $800,000 in the next round. If he doesn't, I'll consider selling to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $800,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally meet it. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $800,000."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It seems like he's not willing to meet my price, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. While it's not the best possible outcome, it's still a good deal for me."
