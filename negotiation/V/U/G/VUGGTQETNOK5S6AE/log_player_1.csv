Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's enough room to negotiate down without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making the offer more appealing. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and it's worth holding out for a better deal from Bob. 

**Next steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to bridge the gap and potentially secure a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, considering your willingness to negotiate. This price still reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob while emphasizing a fair deal for both sides.
* **Strategic price:**  $1,300,000 is a compromise that allows for further negotiation if needed but keeps the deal profitable for me. 

This approach aims to maintain leverage while showing a willingness to negotiate, increasing the chances of securing a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a lower offer outweighs the potential benefits. 

Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, and ensures I don't risk losing out on a much better deal."
