""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below this price maximizes the chance Bob will accept while still securing a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that.
* **Perceived Value:**  Offering a high price close to Alice's minimum might make Bob perceive the product as having higher value, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
