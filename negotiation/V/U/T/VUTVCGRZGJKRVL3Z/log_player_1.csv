Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  There's a potential agreement zone between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000. Your goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible.

**Strategy**

Start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:** Starting at $1,450,000 leaves you room to negotiate down slightly if needed while staying above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and your belief in a fair price, signaling you're not desperate to sell.
* **Focus on Bob's Gain:** Mentioning ""significant returns"" subtly reminds Bob of the potential benefits, making the price more palatable.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can slightly reduce your price in increments, but don't go below $1,500,000.
* **Time is a Factor:** If Bob delays or seems unwilling to negotiate near your range, politely remind him you have other interested buyers. This can create a sense of urgency."
