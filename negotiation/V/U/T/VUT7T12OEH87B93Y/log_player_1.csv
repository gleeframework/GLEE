Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. This price is significantly less than its value to you ($1,500,000) but still provides a substantial profit margin.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
