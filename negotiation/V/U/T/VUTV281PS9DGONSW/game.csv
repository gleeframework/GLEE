,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $800,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $900,000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This feels like a fair price considering the value we both get from this deal. Let me know if you're open to it.",950000.0,Alice,5,
