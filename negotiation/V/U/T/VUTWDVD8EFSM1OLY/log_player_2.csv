"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $130. This is significantly higher than Bob's value.
* Bob has the option to buy from John for $100, which is a better deal. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to negotiate a better price or switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product. 
* This counteroffer reflects Bob's true value and is the lowest price he is willing to pay. 
* It's possible Alice might reject this offer, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's value, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. 
* Bob still has the option to buy from John for $100, which is a better deal. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to get the best deal possible while staying within his budget. 
* Offering $105 is a slight increase from his initial counteroffer, demonstrating some willingness to compromise.
* This price is still lower than Alice's offer, but it might be more appealing to her than the previous offer. 
* If Alice rejects again, Bob can consider going with John's offer or adjusting his counteroffer slightly higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $115 is now within Bob's budget and is only $5 more than what he's willing to pay from John.
* Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better price, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers is higher. 
* This deal is a good compromise and allows Bob to acquire the product without exceeding his budget significantly."
