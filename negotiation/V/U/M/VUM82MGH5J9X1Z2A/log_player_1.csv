Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  We start high to maximize potential profit.  Even if Bob negotiates down, we're still aiming for a price significantly above his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" we create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification of Value:** While we don't explicitly state why the product is worth this much to us, we imply that it's valuable by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and targeting Bob specifically. 

**The Goal:** The ideal outcome is that Bob accepts this offer, netting us a significant profit. If he negotiates, we have some room to go down while still remaining above John's offer. If he outright rejects it, we have our backup buyer."
