"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's time to close the deal."
