Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,750.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,600?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,700. This is as low as I can go, but I'm still confident it's a great deal for you. What do you think?

Alice has come down to a price that's within my budget and is getting closer to my target price.  While I could keep negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the deal. $8,700 is a good price, and I'm happy to accept it."
