Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) while ensuring the deal is still very attractive to him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **High Anchor:**  By starting with a strong initial offer, we anchor the negotiation higher, making it more likely Bob will offer a price closer to our desired range.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the deal a clear win for him."
