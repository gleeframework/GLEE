"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $18000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer is a good strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $14000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your desired price point.  You have more rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price, so it's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $13500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above your budget.  While you could continue to negotiate, you only have a limited number of rounds left.  It's likely that Alice will continue to offer prices higher than your $12,000 limit. Since John is willing to sell for your budget price, it's the most efficient option to buy from him now."
