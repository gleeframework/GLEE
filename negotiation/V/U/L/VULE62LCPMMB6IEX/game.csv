"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both parties involved.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows you to make a substantial profit, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
