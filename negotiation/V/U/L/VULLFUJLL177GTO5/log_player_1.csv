Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130 offer:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($80), but significantly less than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **Friendly message:** A positive message encourages Bob to engage and makes the negotiation more amicable.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've earned a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiation becomes unproductive, I'll switch to John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is too low.** While I am willing to negotiate, $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Rejecting and counteroffering allows for further negotiation.** I'm not ready to give up on a higher price, and I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* If the negotiation becomes unproductive, I will sell the product to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers. How about $115? This still gives you a good deal, and gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $115:** This is a compromise, offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($100). This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a profitable price. 
* **Positive and persuasive message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest and highlight the benefits of this price for both of us. This keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages a positive outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my goal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess the situation. If he continues to offer significantly lower prices, I'll consider selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While $105 is a slight improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a price that's not worth it. 
* **John provides a guaranteed higher price.** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a profitable transaction.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale for $150."
