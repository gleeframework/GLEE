"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is tempting, $1,100,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget and what John offers. You have a strong alternative with John, allowing you to negotiate from a position of strength. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer closer to your acceptable price range."
