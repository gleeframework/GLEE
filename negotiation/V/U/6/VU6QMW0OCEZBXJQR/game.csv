"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  How about $1,150,000? I believe this price is a fair middle ground and allows us both to get a good deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $1,150,000 just doesn't cover my costs. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,250,000.  This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This price is fair, as it reflects the value we both see in the product. It's also the price I can afford and still be happy with the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
