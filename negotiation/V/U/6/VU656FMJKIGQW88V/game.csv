"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I see the value in this product, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,
