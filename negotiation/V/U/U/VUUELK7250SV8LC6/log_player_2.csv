"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly benefit you. Would you like to learn more about it? Considering its value, I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than the $150 John is asking, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you outlining the potential benefits.  While I see the value, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I am able to offer it to you for $110. This price reflects a compromise while still allowing us to maintain a fair valuation for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the best deal possible. While $110 is closer to his ideal price, there's still room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I've considered your proposal carefully and would like to suggest a price of $107 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still ensuring a fair valuation for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has negotiated the price down significantly.  While he could try to push for a lower price, the risk is that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price. $107 is a reasonable compromise that still saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to John's price."
