"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,000. I understand that's a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,200. I think this is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,200.  While I could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of her increasing her price or me missing out entirely. Buying from John for $10,000 ensures I get the product and avoids potentially overpaying."
