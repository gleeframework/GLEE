Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation while still allowing me to make a profit. I'm confident that I can get a higher price than what John is offering, so I'm willing to negotiate with Bob for a while."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. While I could sell to John for $10,000 right now, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $11,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer.  I believe this price is still fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite where I want it to be. I'm going to reject his offer and make one more counteroffer. I'm confident that I can get a slightly better price than $9,800, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,200. This is a final compromise, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting it. I'm willing to go down slightly from my last offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting at least something closer to my initial goal. If Bob rejects this, I'll have to take John's offer and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is only $100 more than what John is offering.  At this point, I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob, and the negotiations are taking too long. It's time to move on and sell to John."
