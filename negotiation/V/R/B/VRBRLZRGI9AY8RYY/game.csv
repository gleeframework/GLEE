"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something I believe will be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. My starting price is $1,200,000, a significant discount given its potential value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a significant investment, but I need to ensure it's a good value for my business.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product brings. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves a significant margin for you. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit rich for my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the value this product provides. I'm willing to compromise further, but only to $1,050,000. This price reflects both the value to you and my need to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal and make it mutually beneficial.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $925,000 is still a bit lower than what I need, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This would allow me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's still a great deal for you, given the product's value. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,8,
