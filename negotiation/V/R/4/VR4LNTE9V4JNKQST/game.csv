"I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This seems like a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While $12,500 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair compromise that shows we both want to find a solution. Let's try to make this happen.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I've given you a good deal, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I need to get a bit more for the product. I can offer it to you for $12,250, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",12250.0,Alice,7,
