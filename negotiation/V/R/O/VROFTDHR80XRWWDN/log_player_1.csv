"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a high price, but still below the value Bob places on the product. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing it as a ""fair price"" to make Bob feel like it's a good deal for him.
* **Open Ended:**  My message encourages a response and starts the dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While $850,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting this offer, I show Bob that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if I don't get a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work. This is still a good price for you, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm making a counter-proposal that's a compromise, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Focus on Mutual Gain:**  I'm highlighting that $900,000 is still a good price for Bob while also suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language that encourages Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While $875,000 is better than John's offer, it's still quite a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still room to push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target.
* **Showing Resolve:**  By rejecting this offer again, I demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a fair price and am not willing to settle for a bargain basement deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant price reduction, and I truly believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, but not giving up too much. This shows good faith while still keeping the price relatively high.
* **Final Compromise:**  I'm framing this as a ""final compromise"" to put pressure on Bob and make him feel like this is the last opportunity.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a good deal for him, highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $880,000 is very close to my target of $880,000. It's only a small difference, and it's a good outcome considering we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he will walk away, or that I won't be able to secure a higher price in the remaining rounds.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds left, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely."
