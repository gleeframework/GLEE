Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $1,400,000 price tag. I'd like to make a revised offer of $1,250,000.

We're getting closer, but I still think there's room for negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested and moving in the right direction. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit further up in the next round."

We're getting close, but it's worth pushing a little further.  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's willing to pay more. Let's counter and see if we can close the gap quickly in the next few rounds."

While we were aiming higher, Bob hasn't budged from $1,250,000 for two rounds.  This likely indicates his firm limit. Accepting now secures a profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob backing out altogether in the final rounds."
