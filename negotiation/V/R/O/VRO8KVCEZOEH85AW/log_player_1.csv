Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message aims to subtly justify the high price by emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value.""
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" suggests there's room for negotiation, potentially leading to a price higher than $1,200,000 but lower than $1,500,000.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider the offer."
