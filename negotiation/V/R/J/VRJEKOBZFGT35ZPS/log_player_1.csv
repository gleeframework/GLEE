Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for potential concessions.  It's also above the minimum value I've set for the product, ensuring I don't undervalue it. 

**Strategy:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** By starting high, I put pressure on Bob to make the first concession.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The difference between my starting price and the minimum value allows for flexibility during the negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:** The knowledge that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I will then analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
