"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and John is offering the product at that price, it makes no sense to negotiate with Alice.  There's no potential to save money by going through the negotiation process.  You're guaranteed to get the product at your maximum price point by buying from John."
