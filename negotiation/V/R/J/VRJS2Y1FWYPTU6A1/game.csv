"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise and still leaves room for you to make a good profit. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $875,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $887,500. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,5,
