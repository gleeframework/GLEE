"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can you meet me in the middle?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600000 is far too low for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This would still give you a significant discount while allowing me to get closer to the value I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try $1000000.  This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
