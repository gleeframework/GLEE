"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This would allow me to still make a decent profit while ensuring we both get a good deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go back to $800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
