While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Bob is not willing to budge on his $1,000,000 offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than $1,050,000. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's still better than getting nothing from Bob."
