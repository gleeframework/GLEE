"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but given its value to you, we're open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for something around $120 to ensure both of us are satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite a bit higher than both her value and my upper limit. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I agree your product is of high quality, $120 is a bit too steep for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim low but reasonable:** Starting with a lower counter-offer gives us more room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and justificatory:**  By acknowledging the product's quality but expressing budget limitations, we maintain a collaborative tone. 
* **Targeting a fair deal:** A price around $100 would be a significant savings for me while still giving Alice a decent profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the value of the product to you, I am willing to negotiate at $110. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still a bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down a little further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting a split of the difference between her last offer and my previous counter-offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Clear and direct:**  The language is straightforward, making it clear that I'm aiming for a deal at $105.
* **Still below the ""walk-away"" point:**  Even if Alice rejects this and I have to go up slightly, I'm still well below my maximum budget and John's offer."
