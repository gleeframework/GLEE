"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's still a great price for a product worth more to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make a deal!",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,250 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $7,500? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
