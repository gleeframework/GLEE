"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Since Bob's maximum is $15,000 and Alice's minimum is $10,000, there is room for both parties to find a price they are happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering $11,000, which is $1,000 less than Alice's offer and $4,000 less than his maximum. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $12,000, which is exactly in the middle between Alice's last offer of $13,000 and Bob's initial counteroffer of $11,000. This shows that Bob is serious about finding a compromise and is willing to meet Alice halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still a bit higher than what Bob wants to pay. However, further negotiation might take too long and Bob could end up paying more.  Considering the risk of Alice walking away, it's safer for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a price within his budget."
