"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,500. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it's a strong starting point that reflects the product's value to me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $11,500 is too low for me. While I could sell to John for $12,000, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial price with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,800.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum.  I believe this is a fair price that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm confident that I can't get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
