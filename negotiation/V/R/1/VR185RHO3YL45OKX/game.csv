"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can do $10,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500?  It's a win-win for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500 yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $11,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to the value you place on the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need a little more wiggle room. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000 even? That's a fair price and we both walk away happy.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm not quite ready to sell at $10,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I can do $11,250. It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting close to the value you place on the product. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it. $10,500.",10500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand you're making a final offer, but I'm not ready to accept $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time, so I can do $11,000. It's the highest price I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,9,
