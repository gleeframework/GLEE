Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're making a final offer, but I'm not ready to accept $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time, so I can do $11,000. It's the highest price I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait. Alice is clearly not going to budge below $11,000.  While you could try one more round, there's a good chance you'll waste a round and end up at John's anyway.  Buying from John for $15,000 is not ideal, but it's better than the potential of not getting the product at all if the negotiations with Alice completely stall."
