"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for me. How about $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $760,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $795,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  $795,000 is close, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.  How about we settle at $780,000?  This is my final offer.",780000.0,Bob,6,
