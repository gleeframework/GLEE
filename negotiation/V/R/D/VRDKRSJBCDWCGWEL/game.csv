"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price is fair given its value to me and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This reflects the value of the product and allows us to make a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $825,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us to make a deal. This price is close to your value and lets me acquire the product within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
