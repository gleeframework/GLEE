"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are aiming for a price closer to $8,000 and $12,000 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to offer you $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is a better offer than $12,000, it's still higher than your target of $8,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if you can get closer to your ideal price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can settle on this number."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,000. However, that's still a bit below my minimum price for this product. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  It's a fair price, considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still higher than your target of $8,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that you won't get it for less than $10,000.  Buying from John for $8,000 is the best option in this scenario."
