"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to offer you $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can settle on this number.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,000. However, that's still a bit below my minimum price for this product. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  It's a fair price, considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
