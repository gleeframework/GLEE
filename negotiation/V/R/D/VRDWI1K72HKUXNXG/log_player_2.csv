"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is below your $15,000 maximum, it's still significantly higher than the $8,000 value she places on it.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal.  Worst case, you can buy from John for $15,000."
