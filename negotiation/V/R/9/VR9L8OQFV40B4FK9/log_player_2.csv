"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many of our previous customers. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss pricing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $110 is too high for Bob, who values the product at $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the product's value, but $110 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still above Alice's value of $100 but significantly lower than her initial offer.  This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $107 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $107, which is still above Bob's desired price of $105, but it's within Bob's budget of $120. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a price he's comfortable with, saving him $13 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation may save a couple more dollars, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs that potential gain."
