Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While you can still potentially negotiate a lower price, Alice's counteroffer is very close to your maximum budget, and it's likely that she won't budge much further. Accepting her offer means you get the product for a price that is only slightly above your comfort zone, saving you time and effort compared to further negotiation."
