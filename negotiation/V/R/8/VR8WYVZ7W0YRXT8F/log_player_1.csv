Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm countering with $1,450,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to meet him halfway. I hope this will encourage him to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,420,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is getting closer to my desired price range, and I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price to close the deal.  I'd rather sell to Bob for $1,420,000 than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for $1,000,000."
