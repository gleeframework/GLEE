"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11800. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11150?  That feels like a fair deal that we can both agree on.",11150.0,Bob,4,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! Meeting in the middle was a great idea. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
