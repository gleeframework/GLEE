You've been negotiating with Alice for a while now, and while she's come down on price, she's still not willing to go down to your target of $120.  You've only got three rounds left, and you don't want to risk getting stuck with a price you're not happy with.  You've already got a guaranteed option with John, so you'll choose to buy the product from him at $120."
