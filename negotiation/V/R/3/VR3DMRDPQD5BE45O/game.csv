"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the initial price I was willing to accept.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000 for the product. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. I'm confident you'll find the product's value to be worth it at this price.",17000.0,Alice,5,
