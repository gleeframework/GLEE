Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I've done my research and I believe it's worth that to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $12,500 is a decent price, and it's closer to my desired price than selling to John for $15,000.  It seems like a fair compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal."
