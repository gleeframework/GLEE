"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already made my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1250000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm not going to risk selling the product for less than my minimum price.",1250000.0,Alice,9,
