"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. It's best to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me. Could you do $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value for the product. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly lower than my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're firm on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $112?"",
""product_price"": 112
}
``` 

I'm moving closer to the middle ground between our previous offers.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still working towards a price that's good for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $112 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is my final offer before I move on to other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting close to her limit, and this is a reasonable price. It's better to accept a good deal than risk losing it by negotiating too aggressively."
