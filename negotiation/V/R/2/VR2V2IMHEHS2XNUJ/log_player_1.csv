Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" I subtly imply the product might be worth even more elsewhere, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites feedback and potential counter-offers.  

Even if Bob rejects the initial $15,000, there's room to negotiate down towards his $12,000 valuation while still staying above my own minimum.  The worst-case scenario is Bob completely refuses, and I sell to John for my baseline price."
