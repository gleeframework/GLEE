Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. This is still a fair price for the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more,  $10,500 is a good compromise and a decent profit for me.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
