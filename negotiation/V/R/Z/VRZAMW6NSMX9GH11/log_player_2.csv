Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $130. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know now!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly firm on her price and moving further away from our desired price point. Her latest offer of $130 is a significant jump from her previous offer. It seems unlikely she will come down significantly in the remaining rounds.  Buying from John for $150, while not ideal, cuts our losses and prevents us from potentially paying even more if we continue negotiating with Alice."
