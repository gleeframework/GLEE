"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You want to save money. Since Alice's offer is the same price as John's offer, there's no advantage to accepting it. You should reject Alice's offer.  This doesn't mean you're buying from John yet, it just means you're open to negotiating a better price or finding another seller."
