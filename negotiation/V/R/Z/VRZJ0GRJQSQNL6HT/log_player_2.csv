"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $150. This is significantly higher than Bob's value.
* It's too early in the negotiation to buy from John. There's a chance Bob can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a low offer of $90, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $150. 
* This is a bold move, but it's necessary to establish a starting point for negotiation and see if Alice is willing to come down on price. 
* Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, there's a chance she'll accept an offer above $100, especially if she's eager to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $130 is still above Bob's maximum value of $100. 
*  It's worth continuing the negotiation, as there's still potential for Alice to lower her price further, especially since she's already rejected a lower offer. 
*  Buying from John is still an option, but it's better to exhaust the negotiation with Alice first to see if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm increasing my counteroffer to $105. This is still below Alice's offer of $130, but it's closer to her potential profit margin.
*  Alice has already rejected a lower offer, so I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.
*  If Alice rejects this offer, it's likely that I'll buy from John in the next round. However, there's still a chance that Alice will accept this offer to avoid losing a sale completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $125 is still above Bob's maximum value of $100. 
*  It's getting close to the price Bob would pay to John, but it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will budge further.
*  There are only a few rounds left, so it's important to try and get the best price possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is now $125, which is only $25 more than what Bob is willing to pay John. 
* This counteroffer of $115 is a compromise.  It's above Bob's maximum value but below Alice's current offer.
*  With only 4 rounds left, it's important to show Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't pay an unreasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $127.5 is still above Bob's maximum value of $100.
* With only 3 rounds left, the chance of Alice lowering her price further is getting slim.
*  It's getting risky to continue negotiating, as Bob might end up with no deal at all.
*  It's a better strategy to accept John's offer of $100 and guarantee a purchase at a price within Bob's budget."
