"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  Bob can likely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. Bob can likely negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has already rejected his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his target, he can likely negotiate a lower price.  He has already demonstrated his willingness to pay around $10,500, and Alice has shown a willingness to lower the price.  Bob should continue negotiating to try to close the deal at a price closer to $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I think we're getting closer.  I'm still sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to accept $10,500, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,750. Let's see if we can get even closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. While he was aiming for $10,500, Alice has lowered the price significantly.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save a considerable amount compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly lower price.  It's important to consider the value of time and the risk of Alice ultimately walking away from the deal."
