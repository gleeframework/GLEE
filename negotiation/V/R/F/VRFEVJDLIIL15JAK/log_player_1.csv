Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than the product's worth to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows you're serious:** A high initial offer demonstrates that you're confident in your product's value.

You'll need to be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still worth trying to get closer to your desired price.  You've already established that Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,500? That way we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Fairness:**  $9,500 is a good middle ground that should still be appealing to Bob, as he values the product at $12,000.
* **Continuing negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, with the potential to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
