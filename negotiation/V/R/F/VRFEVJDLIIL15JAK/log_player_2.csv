"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is much higher. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice values the product at $8,000, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,500? That way we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price of $9,000 and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially losing the deal altogether is high.  At $9,500, Bob saves $2,500 compared to buying from John, making it a worthwhile purchase."
