"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package that's usually valued at $1000. This way, you'll get the product for $11000 and the support package for free. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
