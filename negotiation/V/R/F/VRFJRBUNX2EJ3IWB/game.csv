"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your desire to find a good deal.  While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
