"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $925,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. While I appreciate the value it holds, I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm confident it can deliver a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget concerns.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still aiming to keep my investment as conservative as possible. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $800,000? This price aligns more closely with my budget while still reflecting the value I see in the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
