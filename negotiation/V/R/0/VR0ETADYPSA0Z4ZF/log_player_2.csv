{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far above your budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left to work with Alice, or you can always buy from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a good value for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 just doesn't work for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1700000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1000000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. $1,600,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your desired price while remaining within my range."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1200000 is getting closer to my expectations, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1400000? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. It's a win-win scenario for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $1,400,000, it is still outside your budget of $800,000.  With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a price that low.  Buying from John ensures you get the product for a price you can afford, and you don't risk running out of rounds with Alice."
