Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly holding firm to a price above $1,000,000. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better deal than $1,050,000. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation failing altogether."
