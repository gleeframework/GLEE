Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a final offer of $980,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

**Reasoning:**

While I could hold out for more, Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $980,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit compared to my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of continued negotiation or losing John's guaranteed offer."
