"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's in my best interest to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a fair profit for you considering your value for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better offer than $18,000, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I have more negotiation rounds, and I can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's in our best interest to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $13,500 is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating. There's a chance I can get her down to my desired price, or at least closer to it. If I fail, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise considering your value for it. Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob. I understand your desire to find a middle ground, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $13,250. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my budget, and we are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that the price won't drop significantly enough to make it worthwhile. It's better to secure the product for my desired price from John than to risk losing the opportunity for a better price."
