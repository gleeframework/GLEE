"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a fair profit for you considering your value for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's in our best interest to reach an agreement. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you and the value I place on it.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise considering your value for it. Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
