Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to keep in mind that Bob could accept or reject this offer, and that you have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $8,000."
