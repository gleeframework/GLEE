"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's a compromise that I think we can both be happy with. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
