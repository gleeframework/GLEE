Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially get him to accept a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $500,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $850,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum price.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $750,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's, and it's closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to meet him halfway, while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I've already had several rounds of negotiation and am feeling a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth.  To avoid further delays, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I get a price that's at least my minimum, and it avoids any further uncertainty with Bob."
