"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects its true worth while still offering you a competitive price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has significant value, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
