"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant value it holds.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in it.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and I'm eager to close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my strong desire to find a mutually agreeable deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but unfortunately, $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while still staying within my budget.  I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work. However,  $900,000 is still significantly below its true value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $950,000. This represents a substantial concession on my part. I believe it's a fair compromise that allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
