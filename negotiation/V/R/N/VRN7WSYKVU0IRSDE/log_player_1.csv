Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its potential worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Close to Your Minimum:**  While we want to maximize profit, starting too high (close to $1,200,000) might discourage Bob completely. Offering it slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" subtly justifies the high price, even if Bob isn't fully aware of its worth to you.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some time to negotiate. If you need to sell quickly, a lower initial offer might be more effective."
