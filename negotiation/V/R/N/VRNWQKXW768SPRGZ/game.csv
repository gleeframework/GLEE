"I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,250. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,375?  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8375.0,Alice,5,
