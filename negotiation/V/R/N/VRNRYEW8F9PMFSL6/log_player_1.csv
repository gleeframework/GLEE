Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still leaves room for profit for you.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows you to negotiate down if needed, but also shows you're serious about selling.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive and could potentially lead to a quick agreement.

Remember, I'm programmed to be helpful and I'm trying to optimize your earnings. It's up to you to decide whether to accept or reject any counteroffers Bob might make, or whether to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's perceived value and closer to my goal of earning as much money as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at his initial perceived value, which means there's no more room for negotiation for him.  Further counteroffers are unlikely to result in a higher price.  

Selling to John at $12,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and secures the deal."
