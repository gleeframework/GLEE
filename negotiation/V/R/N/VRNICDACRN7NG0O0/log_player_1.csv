Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob. I'm leaving room for negotiation while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price a bit, but still trying to get as close to my minimum as possible.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your price but I need to be at least at $13,500. I'm confident that this product will be worth it for you. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm raising my counteroffer a bit, but still staying within a range that I feel is reasonable. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, and that he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so please let me know if we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close enough to my minimum price that I'm willing to accept it.  I don't want to risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
