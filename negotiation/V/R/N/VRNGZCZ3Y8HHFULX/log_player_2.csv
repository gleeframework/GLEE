While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit lower before considering the alternative of buying from John."

Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $900,000.

Alice is sticking to her price, and while $900,000 is closer to your target, it's still not the best deal.  It's better to go with John's offer and save yourself $100,000."
