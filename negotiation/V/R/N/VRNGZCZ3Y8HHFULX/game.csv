"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account both our perspectives. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen!",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
