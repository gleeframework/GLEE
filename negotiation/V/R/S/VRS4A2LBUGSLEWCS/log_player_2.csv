"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is pitching the product as a great deal, we don't know the actual value of the product to her. There's a chance she's willing to sell it for less than $12,000. By rejecting the offer, I can open up the possibility of a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to find a better price. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already come down from $12,000 to $11,500.  This is a good deal for me as I'm willing to pay up to $12,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'd have to buy from John at the full price. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a lower price than John's, and I save $500."
