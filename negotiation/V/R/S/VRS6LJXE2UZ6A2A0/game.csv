"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for a price that I think is very reasonable, considering its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product would bring to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the closest I can get to your budget without going below my minimum price, which is $8,000 for me.",8500.0,Alice,5,
