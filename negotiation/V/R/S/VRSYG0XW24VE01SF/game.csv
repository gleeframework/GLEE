"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.

I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial and ensure a successful partnership. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price is reasonable considering the potential benefits for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
