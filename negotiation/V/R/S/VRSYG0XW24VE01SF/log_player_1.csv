Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still below Bob's perceived value, but allows for potential negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  The $100,000 buffer gives Bob room to make a counteroffer without immediately feeling like I'm being unreasonable.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the opportunity and value to Bob, making the offer more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter. 
* I'll keep in mind John's offer as a safety net, allowing me to walk away if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.**  While $1,200,000 is still more than John's offer, it's not a good enough deal for me. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, especially since he's already acknowledged the product's value at $1,500,000.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to reach a compromise.  
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers you. I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial and ensure a successful partnership. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still holding out for a good price.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I'm reiterating the product's value and the potential benefits for Bob, reminding him that a higher price is justified.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm using language like ""Let me know your thoughts"" to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response and decide whether to accept his counteroffer (if he makes one), counter again, or sell to John.
* I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price is reasonable considering the potential benefits for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price point. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could potentially counteroffer again and try to squeeze out an extra $50,000, the risk of Bob rejecting and ending the negotiation is high. 
* **Securing the Deal:**  Selling at $1,300,000 is significantly more profitable than selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

*  I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
