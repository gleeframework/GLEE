"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I understand that you're interested in the product, but I believe it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you've indicated you're willing to pay.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $900000, so I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
