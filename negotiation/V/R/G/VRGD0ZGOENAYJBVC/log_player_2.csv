You should reject Alice's offer. It's above your budget, and you have a better option with John.  You can counteroffer Alice to see if she's willing to come down in price, but you can always walk away and buy from John."

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still a starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will make Alice realize that she needs to come down in price if she wants to make a deal."

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her original offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I will counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap."

This time, I'm offering $1,300,000.  This is a reasonable compromise that's still within my budget, but also shows Alice that I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject this offer and make one more counteroffer.  If Alice doesn't accept, I'll buy from John."

I'm offering $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my last counteroffer and shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. However, it's still within my budget and below John's price. If she rejects this offer, I'll buy from John."

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer is still $50,000 over my preferred price. John offers a better deal, so I'll go with him."
