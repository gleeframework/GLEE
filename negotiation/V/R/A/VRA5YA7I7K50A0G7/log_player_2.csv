"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $925,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as this offer won't last long. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll be able to buy from John, which is still within your budget."
