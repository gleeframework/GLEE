Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position.  

By starting the negotiation at $14,000, Alice increases the chance of a quick sale to Bob at a price significantly above his perceived value, while still leaving room to negotiate if needed."
