"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is above your maximum price. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer considerably lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to lower her price.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $75 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $75 is closer to your target price, it's still above your ideal budget. Alice seems open to negotiation, so it's worth trying to get the price down further. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have the option to buy from John for $80, so you have some leverage. You wouldn't want to pay more than that through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $70? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer by $5, showing Alice that we're willing to move closer to her price, but we're still aiming for a good deal.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Suggesting $70 ""feels like a fair deal"" is a subtle negotiation tactic to try and anchor the price in Alice's mind. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're now $10 below John's alternative offer, giving us some bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $72.50. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $72.50 is a good price and significantly below your initial maximum of $80. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, or she might not budge further. Accepting now secures the product at a desirable price. 
* **""Lowest I can go"":** Alice's language suggests this is likely her final offer."
