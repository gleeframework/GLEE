"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice ($8,000). It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer that is closer to the product's value to Alice. He's also trying to frame the negotiation in a positive light by suggesting finding a middle ground. This could encourage Alice to be more flexible in her next offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save more money. While $11,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target.  He's willing to continue negotiating to see if he can secure an even better price. There are still 7 rounds left, so there is time to continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,000 is still a bit steep for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is exactly halfway between his previous offer and Alice's last offer. This shows he is willing to compromise further but still wants to achieve a price that's more favorable to him. The message also emphasizes a positive outcome for both parties, hoping to encourage Alice to accept the offer."
