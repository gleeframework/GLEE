"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to you. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,000 is still a bit steep for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",10500.0,Bob,4,
