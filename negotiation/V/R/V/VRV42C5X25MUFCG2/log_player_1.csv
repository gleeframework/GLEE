Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, due to financial constraints, I still can't meet your current price. I am willing to go up to $1,075,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving in the right direction, we still have room to negotiate. It's too early to settle for $1,075,000 when we know he values the product at $1,200,000."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed my budget again, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,085,000. I hope this helps us reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but his increases are getting smaller.  It's unlikely he'll drastically change his position. Accepting $1,085,000 now ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him stalling or the deal falling through altogether."
