{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point for negotiation. It's higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for bargaining.
* **""Unique product"":**  This vague description could spark Bob's curiosity and make him want to learn more. 
* **""Let me know what you think"":**  This invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and makes it clear that I'm open to discussion.

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:** This gives me room to negotiate down without going below my minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will give me insights into his perceived value of the product.
* **Maintain control:**  By offering a price first, I'm setting the tone for the negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the flow of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am very interested, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get a better price. 

* **Reason for rejection:**  I'm not desperate to sell and believe Bob's interest is high enough that I can push for a higher price.
* **Next Steps:**  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also showing that I'm not willing to accept a drastically lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $15,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise, making it more likely for Bob to accept. 
* **Reinforcing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to him, which can help sway his decision.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $16,500 is still higher than my minimum, giving me a comfortable margin. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a decent price.  If he rejects, I'll have to reassess the situation and decide whether to lower my price further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could we discuss a price closer to $14500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I believe I can achieve a slightly higher price with a final counteroffer.

* **Reason for rejection:** I'm motivated to maximize my profit and haven't reached the point where I'm willing to settle for the minimum. 
* **Next Steps:** I will make one final counteroffer, likely somewhere between $14,500 and my previous offer of $16,500.  If Bob rejects, I will accept John's offer to ensure I don't miss out on a guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's settle on $15,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  This is my last offer."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final concession:**  I'm signaling that this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Fair price:**  I'm framing $15,500 as a win-win situation, emphasizing its fairness for both parties. 
* **Confidence in the product:**  By reiterating my belief in the product's value, I'm aiming to solidify Bob's conviction in his purchase. 

**Next Steps:**

This is my final counteroffer. If Bob rejects, I will immediately move to sell the product to John for $12,000."
