"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product.  After careful consideration, I'm pleased to offer it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Confident Justification:** While the price is high, I'm framing it as reflecting the ""true value and potential.""  This positions the product as a premium opportunity and avoids directly devaluing Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room for John:** Offering it at $2,250,000 keeps the door open to selling to John ($1,500,000) if Bob's counteroffers are too low.

This initial offer sets the stage for a strategic negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm prepared to pay. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and my initial offer. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, I still have plenty of rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:** I'm directly stating that Bob's offer is too low while reiterating the product's value. This reinforces my position without completely shutting down the negotiation.
* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I'm making a substantial drop from my initial offer ($2,250,000 to $1,900,000). This shows flexibility but keeps me well above both my minimum and John's offer.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I'm framing the new price as a ""fair compromise,"" encouraging Bob to move closer to my range. 

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation forward while keeping the deal potentially more lucrative than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but I have a budget in mind. I can go up to $950,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, $950,000 is still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum. It's clear that substantial movement is needed for a deal to be reached. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see a significant jump from Bob to continue engaging."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still quite large. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I need to see a more significant move on your end. Would you be willing to consider $1,750,000? This reflects the true value of what I'm offering while acknowledging your willingness to engage in good faith."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the Gap:** I'm directly addressing the significant difference between our desired prices, emphasizing the need for a substantial move from Bob.
* **Smaller Concession:** This time, I'm making a smaller concession ($150,000) from my previous offer, signaling that I'm becoming less flexible. 
* **Justification and Appeal:** I'm framing the new price as both fair and a recognition of Bob's efforts, attempting to keep the negotiation positive while maintaining a firm stance on value.
* **Time Consideration:** With half the rounds remaining, I need to guide Bob closer to my range or seriously consider accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about purchasing this product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  I believe this demonstrates my commitment to making a deal, while still respecting my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tempting offer from Bob as it's getting closer to my minimum. However, I still have four rounds of negotiation left and believe there's room for him to go higher. Accepting $1,100,000 would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table compared to John's standing offer. My next counteroffer will need to signal a willingness to close the deal soon if he shows he's willing to meet me closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear you're serious about this purchase, and I respect your commitment to reaching a deal. To show my willingness to find a middle ground, I'm prepared to accept $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm coming down to my absolute minimum price. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to close the deal but leaves no room for further negotiation on my end.
* **Finality and Justification:** By stating this as my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and emphasizing that accepting this is the only way to acquire the product from me.  
* **Time Constraint:**  With only three rounds left, I need to push Bob towards a decision and be prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if necessary.

This counteroffer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He now needs to decide if the product is worth my final price or risk losing the opportunity to acquire it."
