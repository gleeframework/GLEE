"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm still hoping to get closer to $1000000. How about $1050000?  It's a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1080000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
