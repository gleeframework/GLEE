"Alice,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This would give us both a fair deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
