Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price that is significantly above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value to Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This would give us both a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it rather than risk losing the deal entirely or having to settle for John's offer."
