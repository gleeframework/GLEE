Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $115 is more than $100, which means Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is still above your minimum of $120, giving you some room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A higher starting price might make Bob immediately walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum selling price of $120. You can likely secure a better price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $110.  This is still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
