Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $9,500, it's still below my minimum desired value of $10,000. I believe I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  I believe this price is still fair, and gives Bob a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get more, Bob's offer is my minimum desired value and  better than selling to John. I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
