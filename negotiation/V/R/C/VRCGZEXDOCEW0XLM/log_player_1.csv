Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Fallback Option:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This provides you with a safety net, allowing you to be more ambitious in your negotiation with Bob."
