"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for Alice to lower the price since she values the product at $12,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $13,500 is a good starting point, but I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000. That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $14,000 is better than John's offer,  it's still above Alice's perceived value of $12,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get closer to his ideal price by making another counteroffer."
