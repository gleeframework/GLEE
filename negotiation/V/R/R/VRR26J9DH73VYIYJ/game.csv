"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $950,000.  Would you consider $975,000?  That's a significant discount from my original offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $975,000, which would be $962,500. Can you consider that?",962500.0,Bob,6,
