{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $8000 or less. I appreciate your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My minimum acceptable price is $10,000. Bob's offer is too low. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is lower than what I need to sell, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $12,000?  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I truly appreciate it. Given my current financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not confident we'll reach a deal with Bob. To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential lower offers, I'm choosing to sell to John for $10,000. This ensures a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
