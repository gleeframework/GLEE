"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000. This is a common strategy in negotiation.  It allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable sale.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is a decent price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price with further negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for a profitable sale.  It's likely Bob will either accept this or counter with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $16,500. This is a good price for me, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's likely that we won't get much closer to my original asking price, and I'm risking losing the deal entirely. I'm going to accept this offer."
