"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $120 is still a bit outside of my budget.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and gets me closer to my goal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $100 is closer, but I'm still losing money at that price.  How about $110? It's a fair compromise, and it gets you a fantastic product at a good price.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and gets me closer to my budget. What do you say?",105.0,Bob,6,
