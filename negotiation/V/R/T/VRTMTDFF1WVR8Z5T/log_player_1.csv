Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $120 is still a bit outside of my budget.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and gets me closer to my goal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $100 is closer, but I'm still losing money at that price.  How about $110? It's a fair compromise, and it gets you a fantastic product at a good price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and gets me closer to my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is still below my minimum desired price of $150, it's better than selling to John at that price and it's within my budget. It seems like Bob is very serious about the product, and we might not be able to get a higher price in the remaining rounds.  It's best to take the offer and move on."
