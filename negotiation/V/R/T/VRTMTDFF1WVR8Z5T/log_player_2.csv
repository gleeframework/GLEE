Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $120 is still a bit outside of my budget.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and gets me closer to my goal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

You're close to your budget, but still slightly over.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before going to John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and gets me closer to my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
