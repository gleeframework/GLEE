"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is above his maximum budget. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start the negotiation by making a strong counteroffer. $10,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $15,000, but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal, especially since he has a guaranteed alternative with John at the same price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product without exceeding his budget."
