{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation and doesn't immediately shut down the deal.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This offer is high enough that Bob may counter, giving me the opportunity to see how strongly he wants the product.
* **The importance of John:** The fact that I have John as an alternative buyer gives me a strong bargaining position and prevents me from accepting offers that are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum:**  Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,200,000 I need.
* **Negotiation potential:** I can likely get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.  
* **The safety net of John:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer allows me to be more aggressive in the negotiation. 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  How about $950,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:**  My counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer.
* **Balancing value and profit:**  This price allows for a profit, but it's closer to Bob's perceived value. This increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  The counteroffer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to potentially get even closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $920,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to settle for a loss at this point.
* **Room for compromise:** Even though Bob is stating he's at his budget limit, there's still room for a counteroffer that benefits both of us.
* **John is my safety net:** The possibility of selling to John for a significantly higher price gives me the leverage to continue negotiating.

I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $920,000 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $940,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by offering a price in the middle of our last two offers.
* **Moving closer to my minimum:**  This price is getting me closer to my desired price point while still being reasonable for Bob.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of this price to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially reach a better price if Bob is still interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $915,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too far below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum of $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate with him will likely result in a loss for me.
* **John's offer is much better:**  Selling to John guarantees me the full value of the product, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Negotiating with Bob is taking time and effort, and there's no guarantee that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. 

Given the risk and potential loss involved in continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John. It's the best decision for maximizing my profit and minimizing risk."
