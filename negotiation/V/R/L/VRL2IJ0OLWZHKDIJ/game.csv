"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",825000.0,Alice,5,
