"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is too high. While it's better than John's offer, there's still room to negotiate and get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point, but it's a significant improvement from the initial offer.  However, there's still potential for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer closer to his desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's within Bob's budget and allows for a profitable deal.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a much higher price is too great. Accepting the offer secures the product at a fair price."
