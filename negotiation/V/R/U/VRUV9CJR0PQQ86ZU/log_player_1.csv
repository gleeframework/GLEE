Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves some room for negotiation but also ensures you get a good price for the product.  It's important to remember that John is a safety net, allowing you to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go as well as hoped."
