"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. I understand it's worth more to you, and this price allows for a significant profit while still being fair to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, but please be aware that I have another buyer willing to pay $800,000 if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer. This doesn't change the fact that her offer is still significantly above her product's value to her.
* You have a better alternative with John, even though it's your maximum budget. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her or proceed with John if necessary."
