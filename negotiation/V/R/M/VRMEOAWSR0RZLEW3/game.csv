"Bob, I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I still believe the product is worth more than $950000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $1000000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can settle on this price. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need to make a profit. I'm not budging from this price, so let's see if we can move forward from here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
