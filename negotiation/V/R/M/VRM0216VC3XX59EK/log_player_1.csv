Round 2

I'll reject Bob's offer, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $13,500 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13,750?"", ""product_price"": 13750}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's getting closer and it's more than what John is offering.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the deal entirely."
