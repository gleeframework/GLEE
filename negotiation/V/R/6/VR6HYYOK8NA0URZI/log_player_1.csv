Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  This is a fair price that considers both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
