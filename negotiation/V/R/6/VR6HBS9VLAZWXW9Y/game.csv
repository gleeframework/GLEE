"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $15,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $16,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, so I'm offering $14,000. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, but that means $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm offering $13,500. Can you consider this offer?",13500.0,Bob,6,
