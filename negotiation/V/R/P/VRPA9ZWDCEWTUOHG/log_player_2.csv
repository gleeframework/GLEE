"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth more to Alice than to Bob, so there's room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the initial offer and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as 140. How about we meet in the middle at 160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should keep trying to negotiate. While $160 is closer to Bob's limit, he can still try to get a better price.  He has room to go lower without going over his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $140. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 140. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you 155. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He has already stated his limit is $140, and going to $155 is getting close to his limit. This is a good time to counter offer again, as he knows he has a safety net with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's my final offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as 145. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 155 and 145, which would be 150. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but he's still exceeding it.  He's also been clear about his budget, and Alice is sticking to her price point.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum price, it's the best option at this point."
