"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is still a significant discount from the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This still leaves significant room for you to profit, and it's a fair price given the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you can live with.",950000.0,Bob,4,
