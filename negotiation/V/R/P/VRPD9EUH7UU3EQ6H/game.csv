"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects its true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your generosity. However, I am not able to meet the price of $1,100,000. Would you consider a counteroffer of $950,000? I believe this price respects the product's value while allowing for a fair transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $950,000 is unfortunately too far below the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,050,000.  This price recognizes your interest in the product while ensuring a fair return for me.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your proposal. I understand your perspective and respect the value of the product. However, I still feel that $1,050,000 is a bit high. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,025,000? This would allow us to reach a compromise that respects both our interests.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
