Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,500. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 14500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your ideal target. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest level and flexibility on price. His response will inform my next move. 
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing I have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000 provides me leverage. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum and my opening offer. Rejecting outright gives me a chance to:

* **Signal Firmness:**  I need to communicate that my initial price wasn't arbitrary.
* **Encourage Movement:**  Bob offered a low starting point; I need to see if he's willing to budge closer to my range. 

I'm not ready to sell to John yet because there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** I'm moving closer to Bob's range, but still above my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the product's value.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Suggesting a middle ground can feel like a ""fair"" solution and encourage Bob to reciprocate with upward movement from his offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not dropping too low too quickly. I retain the option to walk away and accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial low offer, showing very little movement. Accepting his offer at $11,500 would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $12,000. Continuing the negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better result, and risks dragging out the process. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
