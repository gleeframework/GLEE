"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should definitely counter-offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and shows interest in the product while firmly indicating that the initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Aiming for Savings:**  The goal is to buy the product for much less than Alice's starting price and ideally close to John's price of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's offer of $140 is better than her initial offer, it's still above your $120 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate. Alice is willing to come down, and you haven't reached your maximum price. 
* **John's Price as Leverage:** Knowing you can get the product for $120 from John gives you a strong position. You can use this as leverage in your next counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $110?  That would really help me out."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price while still staying under your $120 limit. 
* **Explaining Budget:**  By mentioning your budget again, you're reinforcing your constraints and making it clear that significant price reductions are necessary.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The tone aims for a compromise. You're acknowledging Alice's efforts while still pushing for a price that works for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm happy to help you out, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's offer of $130 is only $10 over your budget. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Negotiations can be tiring. Accepting this offer saves you the effort of another round and potential deadlock. 
* **Small Savings vs. Risk:**  While you could try to get it down to $120, there's a chance Alice won't budge further, and you'll end up buying from John anyway.  Saving $10 might not be worth the risk of losing the deal with Alice altogether."
