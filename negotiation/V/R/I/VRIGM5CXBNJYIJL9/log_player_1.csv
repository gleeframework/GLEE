"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while securing a decent starting point.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It also builds a sense of urgency by suggesting this is a great opportunity. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation. By starting with a relatively high price, I can potentially secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more realistic price. How about $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low,  well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic price cut. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, keeping in mind the value to Bob and the remaining rounds. I need to strike a balance between getting a good price and not losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm dropping the price considerably from my initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable value. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a reasonable profit.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's perspective but reiterates the value proposition and emphasizes the compromise made on my end.  I'm  trying to build a sense of urgency by suggesting a fair deal that should be accepted.

**Strategy:**

With 7 rounds left, I need to find a price that balances profitability with the potential risk of losing the deal.  My goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum acceptable value as possible while keeping negotiations open. I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,250,000 is still a big leap for me.  I could consider something closer to $700,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product right now. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a bit higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  

**Strategy:**

With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic.  While selling to John would guarantee my minimum acceptable value, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired range, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Think about it carefully; this might be our last chance to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering the price again, but still maintaining a significant margin above my minimum acceptable value.  
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the ""bottom line"" aspect, adding a sense of urgency, and reiterating the value proposition for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm pushing closer to my desired price while still leaving some room for negotiation.  
* I'm strategically using a sense of urgency to potentially motivate Bob to accept.  
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to make a difficult decision about selling to John or continuing to negotiate."
