"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,600,000 is not within my budget. Could you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, but we still have a ways to go. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000, which I believe is fair. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  However, the value of this product is substantial, and I need to reflect that in the price. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I am serious about purchasing it.  However, $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
