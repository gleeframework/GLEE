,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the quality and value this product offers.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10500 again, but I'm also throwing in a small additional service that's worth $500. This way, you'll be getting the product and a bonus service for the price of $10000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced that the additional service is worth the extra $500. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I need to be sure that I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider going down to $9800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
