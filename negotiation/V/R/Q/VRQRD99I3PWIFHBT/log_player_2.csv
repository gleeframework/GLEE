Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the quality and value this product offers.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10500 again, but I'm also throwing in a small additional service that's worth $500. This way, you'll be getting the product and a bonus service for the price of $10000. What do you think?
