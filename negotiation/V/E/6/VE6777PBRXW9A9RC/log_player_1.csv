Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows both of us to benefit from the deal.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
