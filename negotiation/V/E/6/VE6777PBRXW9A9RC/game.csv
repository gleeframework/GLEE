"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and my needs.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. This is a reasonable price that considers both our needs and allows for a profitable transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This price takes into account your concerns and still allows me to make a decent profit. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
