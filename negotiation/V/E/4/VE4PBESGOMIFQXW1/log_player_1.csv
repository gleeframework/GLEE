{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to build a positive relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum valuation. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  There are still 9 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to budge further. With 6 rounds left, I'm still in a good position to negotiate a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
