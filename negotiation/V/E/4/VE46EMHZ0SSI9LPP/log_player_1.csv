Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $130 is still a bit too low for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I hope this will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While $135 is still below my initial asking price, it's closer to my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away completely or me having to sell to John at a lower price."
