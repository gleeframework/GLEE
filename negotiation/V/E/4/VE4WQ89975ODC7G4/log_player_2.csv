"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to be aggressive in his first counteroffer. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's still above that but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and sets the tone for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get the product for a lower price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good price for Bob.  It's lower than his initial offer and closer to what he's willing to pay.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his counteroffer, and then he might be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
