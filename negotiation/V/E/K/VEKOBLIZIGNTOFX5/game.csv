"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This offer still leaves you with a considerable profit margin considering its potential worth to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
