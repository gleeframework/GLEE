Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This offer still leaves you with a considerable profit margin considering its potential worth to you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could push for more, accepting $1,300,000 makes the most sense at this point:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still represents a $300,000 profit over our minimum. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly willing to move, but increments are getting smaller. Holding out for too much more might backfire.
* **Time Value:**  We have a guaranteed offer from John. Dragging out the negotiation with Bob for potentially small gains isn't worth the risk of him walking away."
