"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to lower her price further. You can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000 if negotiations with Alice don't result in a more favorable price."
