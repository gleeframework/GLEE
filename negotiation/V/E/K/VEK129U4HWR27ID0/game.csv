"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $680000. I believe it's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",680000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $680000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $720000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $720000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my original offer and your last offer, which would be $700000. I think that's a fair price for this product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $715000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go up to $715000. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $700000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $800000.",700000.0,Bob,6,
