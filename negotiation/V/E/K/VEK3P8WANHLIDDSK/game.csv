"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I understand you're looking for a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $140 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $90? I feel that's a fair offer.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  I could let it go for $130. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience. I can see this product is valuable, but $130 is still a stretch for me.  How about we make it $100 even? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
