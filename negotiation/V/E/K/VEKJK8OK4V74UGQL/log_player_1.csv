Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done some research, and I believe the market value of the product is around $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you at the market value, which I believe is $12,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is holding firm at his perceived market value of $12,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. Accepting his offer means losing out on potential profit. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation risk."
