"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but $7,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is still quite low, and I'm trying to find a price that reflects the value of this product.  Would you be willing to consider $8,200?  This is a very fair offer.",8200.0,Alice,5,
