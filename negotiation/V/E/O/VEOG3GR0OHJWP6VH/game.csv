"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $100. Considering its high quality and unique features, I'm proposing a starting price of $150. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality you're highlighting, $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your offer while still valuing our product, I propose a counteroffer of $140. This price reflects the value we place on the product while being mindful of your current situation. Please let me know if this works for you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $140 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my original offer of $125.  Would you be willing to come down to $135? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. After considering your latest offer, I would like to counter with $137. This price respects your budget while also ensuring a reasonable profit for us. I hope this proposal works for you.",137.0,Alice,5,
