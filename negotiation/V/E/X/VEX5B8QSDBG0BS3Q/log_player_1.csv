Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a bit higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm prepared to come down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I believe there's a chance Bob will come up a bit more.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm going to counteroffer with $14,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum and leaves room for a potential agreement.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems like Bob is unwilling to meet my price. While $13,000 is a decent offer, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and a better outcome at this point."
