"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $850000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $870000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",870000.0,Alice,5,
