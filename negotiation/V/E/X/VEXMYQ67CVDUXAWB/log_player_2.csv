"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good price, he can likely get it for even less. It's worth negotiating further to see if he can reach a price closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $8,500 is a good offer, it's a little lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a good profit on the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target, he's still willing to walk away and get the product from John for $8,000.  He should continue negotiating to try and get Alice to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair here.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  This is a great price for the product, and it's the closest I can go.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's very close to his target price, and is likely to be able to get a better deal with continued negotiation.  He's also still within his limit of 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. I'm hopeful you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I've already come down quite a bit on my price, but I can meet you in the middle at $8,825.  This is the absolute best I can do. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,825. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,825
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has come down significantly, the price is still above Bob's target of $8,000. With only a few rounds remaining, the chances of getting a lower price from Alice are slim.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John and ensure he stays within his budget."
