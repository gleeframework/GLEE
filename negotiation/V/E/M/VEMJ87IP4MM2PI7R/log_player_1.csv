Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a competitive offer considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John,  trying to sell to Bob first at a higher price could result in a better profit margin.
* **Finding a Balance:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so offering it at that price or slightly above might be tempting for him. However, going too low wouldn't benefit you. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's valuation but still potentially attractive compared to him losing out on the deal.

This strategy aims to find a win-win situation where you earn more than your minimum and Bob gets the product at a price he might consider reasonable."
