Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still being beneficial to me.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The price is lower than my minimum, but leaves space for a few rounds of counteroffers before I have to consider John's offer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation, making Bob feel like we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a start, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, considering he is clearly interested in the product.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** While John offers the ideal price, it's always good to explore all options before committing. There's a chance I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable price.
* **Clarity and urgency:**  I'm keeping the message concise, highlighting the need to find a solution for both of us.
* **Maintaining my goal:**  While lowering the price, I'm still significantly above Bob's initial offer, aiming to secure a sale closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for your product. I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer, while an increase from his previous offer, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I've already lowered my price twice. Bob is clearly interested in the product and there's still room for a counteroffer to reach a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer is tempting:** While John's offer is very appealing, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet.  One more counteroffer could potentially close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to go one more step and meet you at $1,300,000. This is truly my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm emphasizing this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Small compromise:** I'm only offering a small increase from my previous counteroffer, showing a genuine willingness to find a compromise.
* **Alternative option:** Mentioning John's offer as an alternative subtly implies I'm not desperate for a sale and I'm willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Appeal to reason:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by presenting my final offer as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000 for your product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant gap:** Bob's final offer of $1,280,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge this gap.
* **Time and effort:** I've already made several concessions and engaged in multiple rounds of negotiation.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely be time-consuming and unproductive.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing a profitable sale. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price or no sale.

It's time to secure a sale with John and avoid further negotiation with Bob, as the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable price with Bob are low."
