"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (20% off) shows Alice that you are serious about negotiating. This counteroffer should encourage Alice to consider a lower price, while still leaving room for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could continue to try to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers or that I'll run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
