"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I think $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $8,200 is still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,600?",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $7,600. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,850?  It seems like a fair compromise.",7850.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,850. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,050. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8050.0,Alice,7,
