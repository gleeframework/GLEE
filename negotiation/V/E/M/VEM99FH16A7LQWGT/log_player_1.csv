Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it ahead of others."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning any price below this is potentially profitable for him.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (John's offer) but want to maximize profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The difference between Bob's valuation and your minimum leaves room for negotiation.
* **The Offer:**  By offering at $1,100,000, you're aiming for a price that's significantly higher than your minimum while still leaving Bob with a potential $100,000 gain if he accepts. 

This strategy balances maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and accepting John's lower offer."
