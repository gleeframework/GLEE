"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Can you meet me at that price?",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $190, which is the lowest I can go for now.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $190 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $170 for the product. Can you consider that?",170.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $185, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $185 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $175 for it. Can you consider that?",175.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can do $182, which is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",182.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $182. I'm willing to pay $178 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",178.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can do $180, but that's really as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",180.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $180. I'm willing to pay $175 for the product. This is my final offer, please let me know if you can meet me there.",175.0,Bob,10,
