Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $22,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Gauge the Waters:** This first offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and understand how far apart our valuations are.  His response will give me a better idea of how to proceed.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $22,000 is far too high for me.  I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I expected him to counter low, but this is too much of a difference.  It's clear we need to negotiate. Selling to John is my safety net, but I'll try to get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $22,000 is still quite a ways off from what I'm hoping to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  I'm confident you'll see its true value once you start using it."", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, But Still Above Minimum:** I've significantly lowered the price from my initial offer to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm staying well above my $15,000 minimum and closer to his initial offer.
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:** I've included a message emphasizing the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I've made a significant move, I'm leaving room for further negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18,000, but I'm still only able to offer $10,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer at $10,000. 
* **Below My Minimum:** This price is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. 

Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to result in a price I find acceptable. It's time to walk away and take the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
