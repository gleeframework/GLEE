Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me. This allows for some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,200,000, which is what I would get from John. I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a more agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to the product's value. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell. I believe this price is a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm getting impatient with the negotiation. I'm confident I can get my asking price from John."
