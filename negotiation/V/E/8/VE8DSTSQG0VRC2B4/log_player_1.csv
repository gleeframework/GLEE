{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,400,000 is a price that is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum desired price. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and professional, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation without immediately resorting to my Plan B (selling to John). It also signals a willingness to be flexible while maintaining a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I believe this price reflects its worth while also allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, I'm not willing to settle for $1,300,000 just yet. 

I want to try and negotiate a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my target by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. Given the value of this product and the potential it holds for your company, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value we both see in this deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  $1,350,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's a reasonable middle ground that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer and highlight the value of the product for his company, emphasizing that this price is fair and beneficial to both parties. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my position and leaving room for potential further adjustments if necessary. It's still possible that I may need to settle at $1,350,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more before accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the potential benefits your product could bring to our company. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to my minimum desired price, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a higher offer. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees I get my desired value.  It's a better choice than taking a chance with further negotiation and risking a lower price."
