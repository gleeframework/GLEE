"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice is offering it for $119.
* You can get it from John for $120.

While Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
