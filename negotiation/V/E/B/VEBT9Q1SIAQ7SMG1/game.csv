"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I believe the product has value, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $850,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a significant way off from what I believe the product's true value is.  I could consider a price of $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product will bring you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects both the product's value and our desire to make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
