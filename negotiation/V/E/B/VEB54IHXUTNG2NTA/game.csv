"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price is still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I can comfortably offer at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant step towards a deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably offer. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that's more within my budget. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. This represents a significant move towards your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on.",990000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're really close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, we've been negotiating for a while now, and I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I understand you're firm on $1,000,000, but I'm only able to offer $995,000 at this point. This is a final offer, as I'm not comfortable going higher.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our needs, and it would be a shame to walk away from this deal.
