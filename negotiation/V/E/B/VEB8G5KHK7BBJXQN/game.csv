"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my own budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you've invested effort in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still slightly higher than my preferred price point.  I'm prepared to offer $1,325,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price considering the value you've assigned to it and my budget constraints.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,325,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $1,340,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I've assigned to the product, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
