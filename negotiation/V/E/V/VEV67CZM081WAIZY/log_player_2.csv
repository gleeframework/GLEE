"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price.  There's room for Alice to come down, and you're in a strong position knowing John will sell it to you for $1,500,000."
