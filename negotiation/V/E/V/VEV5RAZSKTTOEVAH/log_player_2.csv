"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to significantly enhance your operations and efficiency. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $10,000. This is a special introductory offer tailored specifically for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $8,000, you have room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a price you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it, as that's closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider your offer. For the product, I would like to propose a price of $9,000. This still allows us to maintain a fair value for the product while accommodating your financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,000 is within your budget and is a good compromise.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of Alice rejecting your offer and having to purchase from John.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's close to your maximum."
