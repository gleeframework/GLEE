{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, which is my guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below my fallback ensures I'm maximizing potential profit while leaving room for Bob to counter-offer.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not revealing I have another buyer, I create a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might be willing to negotiate slightly, but I should never go below $15,000 since I have a guaranteed sale at that price."
