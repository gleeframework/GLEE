I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$8,000 is far too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm lowering my price to $17,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum and leaves some room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer."

I'm going to drop my price to $13,000.  This is a further compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price."
