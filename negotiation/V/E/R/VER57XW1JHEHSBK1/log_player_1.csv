Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is a decent amount, it's still lower than what I consider the product's minimum value. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a price we both agree on."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm concerned that we're not going to be able to close the deal before the 10 rounds are up. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the safer option."
