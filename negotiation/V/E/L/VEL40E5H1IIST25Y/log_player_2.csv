"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is high:** While $950,000 is below your maximum, it's still a significant amount. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room to negotiate, as Alice is open to it.
* **More information:** You need to gather more information about the product's value to you before committing to such a large purchase. 

By rejecting the offer, you can:

* **Gather information:**  You can probe Alice about the product's value to her, its uniqueness, and potential resale value. 
* **Set a lower counteroffer:** You can use this information to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely a tempting product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $800,000, considering the potential value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  A significant reduction from Alice's initial offer will force her to consider your position and demonstrate your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for your counteroffer â€“ the value to you. It's important to set the stage for a productive negotiation. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  While $800,000 is a substantial drop, it's not unreasonable, leaving room for Alice to counter with a price you might find agreeable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's compromise:**  Alice has moved significantly from her initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair price:** $875,000 is a good compromise, especially considering the potential for more back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Time factor:**  With 7 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal to John or missing out on a potentially favorable price.

Accepting the offer is a strategic move that secures a product within your budget while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
