"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely a tempting product, but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $800000, considering the potential value to me. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",875000.0,Alice,3,
