Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 sits comfortably between Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial price provides some wiggle room should Bob attempt to negotiate a slightly lower price. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for an extra $150,000 profit justifies taking that calculated risk."
