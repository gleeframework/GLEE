Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party waiting."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from the sale. While you have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, there's potential to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him.
    * You gain an extra $150,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another interested party adds a subtle pressure on Bob to make a decision quickly without revealing your guaranteed sale price."
