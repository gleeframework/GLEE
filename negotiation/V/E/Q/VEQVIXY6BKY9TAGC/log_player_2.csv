Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $140 was still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

Reason: While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach my $120 limit. I can get the product right now from John at that price, saving me time and potential further negotiation."
