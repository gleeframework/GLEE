"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000, knowing Bob values it at $10,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we both agree on.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate to secure the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, and it gets me closer to my minimum target.  I'm hoping he'll see the value and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm going to counter with a price that's slightly higher and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's very close to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping he'll see that we're both getting closer to a deal, and he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and while $13,500 is still lower than I hoped for, it's a good deal.  I'm also running out of time, and I don't want to risk John making a better offer.  $13,500 is better than selling to John for $15,000, and it's likely that Bob won't go any higher."
