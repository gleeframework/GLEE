"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's potential. However, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000 for the product. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and a good starting point for a mutually beneficial partnership. ",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm targeting. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum requirements. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
