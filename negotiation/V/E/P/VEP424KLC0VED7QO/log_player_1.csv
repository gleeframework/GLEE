{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're making a profit of $4,000, which is above your minimum requirement.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely he'll accept or counteroffer.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It's easy for Bob to understand what you're offering. 

By starting with this offer, you create an opportunity for negotiation while still ensuring you make a reasonable profit."
