"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but  $2,000,000 is unfortunately well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for this, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond even your initial assessment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what we're discussing.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This reflects the real value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the potential in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $1,600,000.  Let's settle at $1,675,000 and close this deal. I believe that's a very fair offer considering its true potential.",1675000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm still aiming to stay within my budget, so I'm offering $1,650,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it represents a fair value for the product given our discussions.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
