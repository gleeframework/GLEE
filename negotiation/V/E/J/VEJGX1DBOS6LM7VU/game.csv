"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product.  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to your operations.  My initial offer is $950000.

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This offer is still a good deal for you, considering the potential it offers. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $875000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875000 is still a bit too low. I understand you want to get a good deal, and I'm trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to let go of this product for less than $890000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $890000. I'm willing to go up to $880000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",880000.0,Bob,6,
