"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $100,000 difference gives Bob room to bargain while still allowing me to make a decent profit.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While I could offer a lower price, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **I have time for negotiation:** I still have 8 rounds left, giving me time to try and close the deal with Bob at a more profitable price.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John gives me the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to come down from my initial offer of $1,100,000, but still aim for a price significantly higher than Bob's offer of $900,000.
* **Staying above minimum:** $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, ensuring a profitable sale.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value and doesn't represent a significant enough gain for me.
* **Time is still on my side:** With 6 rounds left, I can continue to negotiate with Bob without risking losing too much time.
* **John's offer is a strong incentive:** The knowledge that I can secure a guaranteed $1,200,000 sale with John motivates me to push for a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and Bob's last offer of $920,000. This shows a clear willingness to compromise.
* **Close to my minimum:** This price is still only $200,000 below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  It's a significant profit, but I'm willing to potentially lose that amount for a quick deal.
* **Pressure building:** With only 5 rounds left, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to make a decision.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be closer to accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is increasing, but I can still afford to be patient.
* **John's offer is a strong fallback:** I'm confident in my ability to secure a deal with John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.  I need to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering a price that's very close to Bob's last offer, demonstrating a strong willingness to reach a deal.
* **Maximizing profit:** $980,000 is still a good profit for me, considering my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **High-stakes decision:** With only three rounds remaining, Bob is under pressure to make a decision. If he rejects, I'll likely accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is critical:** Only two rounds remain, and Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value and even lower than his previous offer.
* **John is the safer option:**  The risk of continuing negotiation with Bob is high, as he might not increase his offer in the next round, and I might end up selling at a price below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is a significant profit and ensures I don't lose money.

By selling to John, I can secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
