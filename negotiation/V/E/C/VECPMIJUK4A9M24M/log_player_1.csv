Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $12,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to sell for at least $15,000, so you have room to negotiate lower if needed.
* **It's a strong opening:**  A firm but fair opening price can encourage Bob to engage in a productive negotiation.

This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest and leaves room for negotiation if he's not willing to accept your initial offer."
