"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum price of $8,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7500, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle of that, so how about $7750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum, I still want to push for a higher price. I'll see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to your minimum price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $8000. I'm willing to pay $7900, which is just $100 less than your minimum. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,900 is close to my minimum, Bob is proving to be a tough negotiator. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
