Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While the product looks promising, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I understand your perspective on the price, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, and doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product and its potential to benefit your business. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,000,000. This would allow us both to come to a mutually agreeable deal.
