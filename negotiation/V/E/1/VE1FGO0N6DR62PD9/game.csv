"Hi Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. I'm excited to share that I'm selling a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While the product looks promising, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the price, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, and doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product and its potential to benefit your business. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,000,000. This would allow us both to come to a mutually agreeable deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
