"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob is genuinely interested, he might be willing to negotiate from this point. 
* **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, I'll earn a significant profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price downwards in subsequent rounds.

I'm aware this is a risky strategy. If Bob is not seriously interested, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Since I have 10 rounds, rejecting Bob's offer gives me more leverage to negotiate.

My strategy is to gradually decrease my offer in subsequent rounds while observing Bob's willingness to negotiate. If Bob shows consistent interest, I can potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm decreasing my offer by $100,000 to $1,400,000. This is a moderate reduction, signaling my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal. 

By reducing the price incrementally, I hope to:

*  **Maintain Bob's interest:**  A gradual decrease is less likely to deter Bob than a large drop.
* **Gauge Bob's upper limit:**  His response will tell me how much he's willing to pay.
* **Maximize potential profit:**  I still stand to make a significant profit if Bob accepts this offer.

If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers strategically in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $1,150,000. While Bob is clearly interested, I believe there's room for negotiation.

Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the bargaining process and potentially secure a better deal.  I have six rounds remaining, which gives me enough time to explore the possibility of a higher price.

If Bob's counteroffers continue to decrease significantly in the next few rounds, I might consider selling to John for $1,000,000, but I'm not ready to do that yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm further lowering my counteroffer to $1,350,000. This is a significant decrease from the previous round, but it's still above Bob's latest offer. 

My reasoning:

* **Maintaining momentum:** By offering a lower price, I'm signaling a willingness to reach a deal. This can encourage Bob to counter with a higher offer. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer is still a good profit margin for me, but it's a good test to see how much Bob is willing to go up. 
* **Limited time:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation.  This offer needs to be compelling enough for Bob to seriously consider, but also high enough to ensure I don't settle for a price too low.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have four rounds left to negotiate. I believe there's still room for a better deal, and I don't want to rush into an agreement that might leave me with less profit than I could potentially get.

My strategy is to continue negotiating and see if I can secure a higher price.  If Bob's offers continue to decrease or if we're nearing the end of the rounds, I might be more willing to accept his offer or consider selling to John. However, for now, I'm opting to reject and keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

With four rounds remaining, it's time to make a significant move.  I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000. This is a considerable reduction from the previous round, but it still allows me to make a substantial profit.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Force a decision:**  I'm putting the pressure on Bob to either accept this offer or make a counteroffer close to it. 
* **Maximize my potential:**  This is a price that's still high enough to be appealing to me, but it's also within the range where I believe Bob might be willing to close the deal. 
* **Minimize the risk:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll still have three rounds to potentially reach a deal, but I'll also be able to evaluate if it's more advantageous to sell to John.

This is a pivotal moment in the negotiation.  Bob's response will determine the direction of the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 less than John's offer, I still have two rounds left to negotiate. It's unlikely that Bob will offer anything higher than $1,050,000, but there's still a chance he might come up a little.

My strategy is to reject this offer and make a counteroffer one last time to try and squeeze out a few more dollars. If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll then accept John's offer to ensure I don't lose out on the opportunity to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm raising the price to $1,100,000, which is still lower than my previous offer but higher than Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm still willing to negotiate but also setting a firm limit. 

My reasoning:

* **Last chance:** This is my last chance to get a better price from Bob. I'm trying to bridge the gap between our offers.
* **Minimizing risk:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll accept John's offer and ensure I make at least $1,000,000.
* **Potential for profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him compared to John's price.

It's a high-risk, high-reward move. If Bob accepts, I'll get a better price. If he rejects, I'll still secure a decent profit from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round, and Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same as John's offer. Since I can't make a counteroffer anymore, it makes no sense to reject Bob's offer.

Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk getting nothing by rejecting Bob's offer and hoping for a better counteroffer in the next round, which doesn't exist."
