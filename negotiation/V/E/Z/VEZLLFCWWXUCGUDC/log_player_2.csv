"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its high value and unique features, I estimate its worth to be $12,000 to me. However, considering its significance to you, I am offering it to you for $9,500. This price reflects a fair compromise between its intrinsic value and your perceived utility. I look forward to discussing how this product can enhance your operations and potentially revolutionize your workflow. Should you have any questions or need further details, please do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you for considering our offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for a price within his budget."
