"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1700000, considering the unique value this product offers. It's a significant investment for your business, and I believe the return on investment will be substantial. Let's find a compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from $2000000 to $1700000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
