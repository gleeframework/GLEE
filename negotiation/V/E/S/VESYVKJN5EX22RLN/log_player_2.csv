"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it would be perfect for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation of the product. You should definitely reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and Interested:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Strong Counter:** The $80 offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, giving you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting low, you're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range. 

Keep in mind, Alice might reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand it's a bit pricier than you were hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still too high for you. You can definitely try to negotiate further down, getting closer to your budget.  Remember, you always have the option of buying from John for $100 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  $130 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $95? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

Here's the strategy with this counteroffer:

* **Acknowledgement:** You're acknowledging Alice's effort to negotiate.
* **Reasonableness:** You're providing a reason for your counteroffer (""a bit of a stretch"").
* **Movement:**  You've increased your offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Target Price:** $95 puts you within striking distance of your $100 maximum while leaving a little room for a final concession if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $110 in the spirit of compromise. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one! Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer by saying so directly.  Here's why accepting is likely the best move:

* **Close Enough:** $110 is only $10 over your budget, a relatively small difference.
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  If you reject and counter, Alice might not budge, and you'll have to buy from John at $100 anyway.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Sometimes, it's better to settle on a price that's decent, even if not perfect, rather than dragging out the negotiation."
