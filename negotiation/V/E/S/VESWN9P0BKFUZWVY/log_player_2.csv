"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice. You can always buy from John if negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $8,500 is still a good price for me, but it leaves some room for her to come up a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a good deal for me.  It's still below my maximum price and I've already gotten her to negotiate.  It's probably not worth pushing for a lower price with the risk of her walking away."
