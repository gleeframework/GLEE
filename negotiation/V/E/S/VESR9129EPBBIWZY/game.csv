"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we work something out closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is still a great deal considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
