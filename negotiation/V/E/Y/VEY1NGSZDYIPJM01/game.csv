"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $60 is too low, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,5,
