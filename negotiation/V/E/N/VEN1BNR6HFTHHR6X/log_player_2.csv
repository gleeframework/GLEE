"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant investment with the potential for great returns based on its value to you.  I understand it's a large sum, but I believe the potential benefits make it worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price, you can likely negotiate a better deal.  There's room to haggle between $1,000,000 and your maximum of $1,200,000."
