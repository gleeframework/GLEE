It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $120, as the product is worth $100 to her."

Alice is still offering a price above your target of $150.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While $122 is getting closer to your target, it's still above your maximum.  You should try to negotiate a bit more, as you're still in a better position than Alice.  If Alice refuses, you can always go to John for a higher price."

Alice is not budging on her price. At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $150. You've already done a lot of negotiating, and it's not clear you'll get a better price from Alice."
