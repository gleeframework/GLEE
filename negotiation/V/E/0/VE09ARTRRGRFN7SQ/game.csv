"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $2,200,000. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in the product.  While I recognize you see its value, $1,700,000  falls short of what I believe is fair given its unique potential.  To find a middle ground, I propose $2,000,000. This reflects my willingness to be flexible while ensuring the product's worth is acknowledged.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $2,000,000 is a bit rich for my blood. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your directness and your continued interest in this product. I know we both see its value, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,850,000? This represents a significant move on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,850,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value.",1700000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but to be frank, we seem to be at an impasse. I have another buyer ready to purchase this product for $1,500,000.  While I believe you recognize the true value of this product and I'd prefer to do business with you,  I'm only willing to go as low as $1,775,000. This is my final offer.",1775000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your honesty about having another buyer, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1,775,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,725,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be close to the price I can get from another buyer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1725000.0,Bob,8,
