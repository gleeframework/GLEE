Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to bring the price down, Bob, but $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but $725,000 is still below my minimum. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the increase, Bob, but $775,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm thinking of $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that we're running out of rounds. What do you think?

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge below $850,000, and her latest offer is a step in the wrong direction.  It's time to cut your losses and take John's offer of $800,000."
