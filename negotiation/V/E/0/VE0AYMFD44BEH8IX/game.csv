"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to bring the price down, Bob, but $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the value and our current positions.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but $725,000 is still below my minimum. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the fact that we're getting close to the middle ground. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to bump my offer up a bit to meet you closer. How about $775,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer, and I think it demonstrates my seriousness about this purchase.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the increase, Bob, but $775,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm thinking of $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that we're running out of rounds. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,7,
