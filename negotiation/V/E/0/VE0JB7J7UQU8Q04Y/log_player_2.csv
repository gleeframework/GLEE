"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has a significant budget ($1,500,000) and can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to negotiate.  It also leaves room for potential compromise.  $950,000 is still a good price for Bob, as it leaves him with a considerable profit margin if he resells it, and it is well within Alice's range of acceptable offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a good price for Bob considering his budget. It's likely that continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or Bob losing time and potentially needing to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids further risk."
