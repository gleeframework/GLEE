Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum price.  I believe this will be a strong starting point to see if Bob is willing to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000, and it's closer to the price I'm aiming for. This counteroffer shows flexibility while keeping my interests in mind."
