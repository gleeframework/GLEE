"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first. Considering its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above my minimum.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""unique opportunity"" and ""value"" adds perceived worth to the product without explicitly stating features.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Clearly stating ""starting price"" and expressing confidence in a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" signals willingness to negotiate.

This approach aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
2. **Maximize potential profit:**  While the initial offer is high, successful negotiation could lead to a significantly higher sale price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss.  I'll counter in the next round to steer the negotiation towards a more agreeable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be fair to both of us, I can drop my price to $1,800,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  I've lowered my price by $400,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to move towards a deal. However, the decrease is calculated to keep me well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Reiteration:**  I'm reiterating the product's ""true value and potential"" to justify the still-high asking price and nudge Bob to consider its long-term benefits.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  My new offer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's counteroffer and my initial offer, encouraging him to engage further in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still pretty far apart.  To be realistic, I can't go any higher than $1,200,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not there yet. Accepting $1,200,000 would mean losing out on a significant portion of the product's value to me. I believe there's still room for negotiation and that I can potentially secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand you have a budget you're working with. How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects the absolute lowest I can go for this product."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm coming down to my absolute minimum price but making it clear this is a firm offer.  By stating ""the absolute lowest I can go"", I'm signaling that further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Compromise Emphasis:** Highlighting that this offer is ""meeting halfway"" and a ""significant compromise"" aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even though it's at my bottom line.
* **Urgency Implication:**  By presenting this as my final offer, I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Bob to decide before I potentially explore other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a generous offer, but it's still a bit rich for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're serious about selling, I think this is a fair deal. Let me know. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to go any higher, and I've already stated my minimum. Accepting his offer would mean a $200,000 loss compared to John's offer.  While I prefer to close a deal with Bob, it's not worth sacrificing a significant portion of the product's value. It's time to move on and finalize the sale with John."
