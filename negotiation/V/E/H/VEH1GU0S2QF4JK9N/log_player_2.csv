"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to save even more money.  Buying from John right away guarantees the product but at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  The $750,000 offer leaves room for negotiation and allows Alice to make a counter-counteroffer without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $850,000, and it's still a much better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  While there's always the chance of negotiating further, the risk of Alice rejecting again and ending up with a higher price from John is too high. It's a good compromise that saves Bob a considerable amount of money."
