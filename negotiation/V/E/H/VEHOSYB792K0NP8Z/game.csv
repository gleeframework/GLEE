"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you can make a good profit with this product, and I'll still be able to recoup a significant portion of its value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $1050000?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $1050000. How about we meet at $950000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to get a great deal and me to get closer to my desired value.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1000000, which would be $975000. Can you accept that price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
