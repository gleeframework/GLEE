"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90. Would you consider that?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $100? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price.",100.0,Alice,5,
