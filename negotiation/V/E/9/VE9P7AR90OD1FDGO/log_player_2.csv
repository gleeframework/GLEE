"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something unique and valuable. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for your maximum price. You can get the same product from John for the same price. Therefore, you have no incentive to accept Alice's offer. Rejecting her offer maintains your bargaining power and gives you more time to find a potentially better deal."
