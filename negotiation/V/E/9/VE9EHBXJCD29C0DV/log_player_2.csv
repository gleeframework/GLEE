The product is worth $150 to me, and Alice is asking for $180. It's not a good deal, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering $140, which is still slightly below my maximum, but gives Alice some room to negotiate."

While $160 is closer to my value, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay my maximum value for the product, but I won't go any higher."
