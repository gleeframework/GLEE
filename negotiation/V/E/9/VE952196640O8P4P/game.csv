,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product for you while allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand your position, I'm still aiming to keep costs down. Could you consider selling the product to me for $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to keep costs down, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,075,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $1,087,500.  This allows us both to reach a compromise.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'd like to propose a price of $1,080,000 for the product. This is a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers and should allow us both to feel satisfied.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
