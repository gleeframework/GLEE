"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm going to have to think carefully about how much more I can give, but I'm willing to meet you at $162. This is my final concession, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",162.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $155 and $162, which would be $158.50. Can you consider that?",158.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $160, and I think we've already been discussing that price. I'm not willing to split the difference again, so I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $162. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options.",162.0,Alice,9,
