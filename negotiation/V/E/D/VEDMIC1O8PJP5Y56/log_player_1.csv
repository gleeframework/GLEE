This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows confidence in the product's value while acknowledging that Bob might have a different price in mind."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
