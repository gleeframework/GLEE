"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $8,500 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on your last offer, but $11,000 is the absolute maximum I can do.  Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Bob,4,
