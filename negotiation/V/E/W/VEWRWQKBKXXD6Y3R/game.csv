"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500.  What are your thoughts?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. It's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  Let's split the difference again.  How about $8,875?  This feels like a fair compromise.",8875.0,Alice,5,
