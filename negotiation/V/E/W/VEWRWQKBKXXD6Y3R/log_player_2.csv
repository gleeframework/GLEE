"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a strong starting point, acknowledging the value of the product while pushing for a lower price. It's important for Bob to be firm but polite during this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still too high.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price. It's important to remember that Alice is also trying to get the best deal, and she may be willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. It's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but still wants to save money. It's a small increase from his previous offer, making it seem like he's willing to compromise while still staying within his budget. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but wants to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  Let's split the difference again.  How about $8,875?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,875 is now within Bob's budget.  While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a good compromise and a fair deal for both parties.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,125 compared to buying from John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that could lead to a stalemate or a higher price."
