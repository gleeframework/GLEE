# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your point. While I understand your perspective, $750,000 doesn't quite cover the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's only willing to pay up to $800,000, and there's still room to bargain."
