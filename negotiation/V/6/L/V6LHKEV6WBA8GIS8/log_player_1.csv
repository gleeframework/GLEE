Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase [product name] for $11,500. I know this product is valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you're well above your minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup plan with John at $10,000, so you're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal that's highly profitable for you while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
