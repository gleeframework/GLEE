"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good compromise between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. It's likely Bob will counter-offer, giving us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is way too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90?  This is a really great product, and I think it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round. I have several rounds left and want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $85? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
