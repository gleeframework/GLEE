"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth significantly more to me. I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $950,000 is simply too low for me. To make this deal work, I'd need to receive at least $1,050,000. This price still represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered the value of your product and am willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both parties and allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is closer, but still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price reflects a significant value for you, while still allowing me to recoup a portion of the value I place on the product. Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your persistence. I'm willing to meet you slightly higher than your last offer. I propose a final price of $1,010,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to conclude this transaction.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
