Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 for the product.  It's still a significant investment for me, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I am willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,075,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000, which represents a significant compromise from my initial offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to meet you halfway.  I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe that selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option at this point. It guarantees me a higher profit and ensures a quick and certain sale.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further delays and a potential lower final price."
