{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice is still not willing to meet your budget. You've been making counteroffers, and Alice has been rejecting them.  You're running out of time, and it's getting risky to keep pushing for a lower price.  It's best to go with the sure thing and buy the product from John for $12,000."
