"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Would you like to make an offer on the product for $1500000?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, my budget allows me to only consider offers up to $800000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1200000. If that's still not feasible for you, I'd be happy to discuss further.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still unable to meet your current offer. My maximum budget remains at $800000. I would be delighted to hear if there's any possibility to reach an agreement within this range.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in purchasing the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
