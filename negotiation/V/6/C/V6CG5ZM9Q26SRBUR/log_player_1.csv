Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but also leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and encourages Bob to respond.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** You've successfully sold the product.
* **If Bob rejects:**  You'll need to analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of your own.  
* **If you feel like the negotiation isn't going well or you're not getting close to your desired price, you can always stop the negotiation with Bob and sell to John for $15,000.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a major loss for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price.  It's better to reject and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is far below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer:** This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **The message is polite but firm:**  I'm not accepting his low offer, but I'm still open to negotiating. 
* **$9,000 is a reasonable compromise:** It's significantly closer to my minimum than Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my target.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $15,000.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about we settle at $9,500? This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my previous offer:** This shows I'm willing to compromise and move closer to Bob's price.
* **The message is polite and highlights the potential for a mutually beneficial deal:** I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect to encourage Bob to accept.
* **$9,500 is a reasonable compromise:**  It's a significant step closer to my minimum value, while still leaving some room for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my target.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $15,000.  As the negotiation progresses, I'm getting closer to my minimum, but if it seems like Bob is not willing to meet my minimum, I will sell to John."
