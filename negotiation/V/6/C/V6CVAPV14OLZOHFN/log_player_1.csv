Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay more than my minimum. If he rejects the offer, I'll be ready to counter-offer, but will always have the option of selling to John for $10,000 if the negotiation goes south."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I believe the product is worth more than that to Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further. 
* **Next Round:** By rejecting his offer, I open the opportunity to send a counteroffer in the next round. This allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and try to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John as a safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails.  This gives me a fallback position and prevents me from accepting a price that is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $14,000 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying the counteroffer by emphasizing the product's value and appealing to Bob's budget constraints.
* **Goal:** I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my desired value while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $14200 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:** While my ideal price is higher,  $14,200 is close to my minimum and represents a good compromise. It's important to balance maximizing profits with the risk of losing the sale.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** Further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, potentially causing me to sell to John for $10,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the possibility of losing out entirely. It's a calculated decision based on the potential gains and risks."
