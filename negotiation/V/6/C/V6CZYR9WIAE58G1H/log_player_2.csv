Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.

It's time to walk away. Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000, and you have a guaranteed option at $800,000 with John.  Sticking to your guns will save you money in this case."
