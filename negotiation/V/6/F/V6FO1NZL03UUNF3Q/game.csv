"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, however, $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down some.  While $15,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be open to that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,500 is still a little steep for me. How about we split the difference between $12,500 and my previous offer, and we call it a deal at $11,250? ",11250.0,Bob,6,
