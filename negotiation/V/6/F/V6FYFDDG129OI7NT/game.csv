"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference at $1,112,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
