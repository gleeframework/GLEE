Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to him. 
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage. You can aim slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping he'll be willing to pay a bit more to secure the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the product's value to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $11,500 is:
    * Above Bob's perceived value, but not unreasonably so.
    * Leaves you room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
    * Still nets you a profit if he accepts.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always revert to John and sell it for your guaranteed $12,000."
