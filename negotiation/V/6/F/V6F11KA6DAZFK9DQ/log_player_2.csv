"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its value and potential impact on your projects, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $10,000. This is a special opportunity tailored for you, considering the high worth you would place on this product. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her ($12,000), it's still higher than your maximum budget ($8,000) and the price John offers ($8,000). Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that might be closer to your budget. If not, you can always buy from John at your desired price."
