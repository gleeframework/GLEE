"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,750,000.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try $1,200,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product to me and the potential for both of us to make a profit. I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I think I can get closer to my goal if I continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both our businesses."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too much for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to me and the profit potential for both of us. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident I can push him a bit further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than my target.  I'm willing to drop to $1,450,000.

Let's try to close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,450,000 is still above my limit.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,350,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing us to close this deal and move forward.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing a deal that meets my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees I get the price I want, and it's a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with less."
