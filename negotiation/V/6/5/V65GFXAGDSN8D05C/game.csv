"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's priced at $2,000,000, reflecting its exceptional value and potential for your business. I believe this is a fair price considering its market worth. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,750,000. This figure still leaves room for profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try $1,200,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product to me and the potential for both of us to make a profit. I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the significant value of the product and still allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both our businesses.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too much for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to me and the profit potential for both of us. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with this offer.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than my target.  I'm willing to drop to $1,450,000. This represents a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a profit.  Let's try to close this deal now.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,450,000 is still above my limit.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,350,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing us to close this deal and move forward.  Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
