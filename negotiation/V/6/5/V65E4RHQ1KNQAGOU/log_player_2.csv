"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. You want to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $125?  It's still a great deal for you, and it works well for me."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $135? It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit high. You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product from John, so there's still room for negotiation with Alice to get a better deal. Rejecting her offer gives you another chance to make a counteroffer and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still hoping for a lower price. How about $130?  That's a good deal for both of us, and it's the most I can afford at this time."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $132? It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $132, which is only $2 more than your initial counteroffer of $130. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate.  You're likely to be able to get a lower price from Alice if you keep bargaining, but it's possible you'll also lose the deal.  Accepting her offer guarantees you get the product at a good price, and saves you time and effort."
