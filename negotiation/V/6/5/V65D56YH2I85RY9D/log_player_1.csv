Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't accept less than $1,000,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim high with Bob since he values the product more than your fallback option (John). However, being too aggressive could lead him to reject the offer. 

**The Offer**

Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value,"" piquing Bob's interest.
* **Ambitious but Reasonable Price:**  $1,150,000 is a strong profit for you while leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal ($50,000 less than his valuation).
* **Gentle Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.

**Important Note:** This is just one potential offer. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
