"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'd like to start with an offer of $9,200. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000.",9200.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get a slightly better price.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  This is still a good deal for you since you value it at $8,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'll propose $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $8,750.  This is a fair compromise and allows you to make a profit while still saving me some money.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll propose $9,250. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
