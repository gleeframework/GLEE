Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's beneficial for you. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" and offering it to Bob before a public listing, you create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, which might make him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is open for discussion. Bob might try to negotiate down, and you have the buffer to do so while still staying above your minimum selling point.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might want to start slightly lower. However, starting too low might make him undervalue the product.
* **Market Conditions:**  If the product is in high demand, you could potentially ask for even more. However, this scenario doesn't provide that information. 

**Remember:** The worst Bob can do is reject your offer, in which case you have your backup buyer, John."
