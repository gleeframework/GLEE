The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $100. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way, we both get a good deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $88? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $88 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $90.  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is still holding out for a higher price. While $90 is closer to my limit, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation. I'll buy the product from John for $80 instead."
