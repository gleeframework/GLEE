"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $80? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a living. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  I'm still a bit over my budget at $110. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous counteroffer. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $95? I'm really hoping to make this deal work.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to $95. I'm willing to compromise at $100. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,7,
