"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is closer to my initial offer.  This represents a significant compromise on my part. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,750 is a significant compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $9,150. This is my final compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal. What do you think?",9150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,150 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,900. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. If you're open to this, we can close the deal right now. What do you think?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,900 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $9,025. This is my final compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal. What do you think?",9025.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground. I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,025 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $8,950, which is a fair compromise for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,950. I'm willing to meet you at $9,075, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",9075.0,Alice,9,
