"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** Bob is offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than the product's worth to Alice. This allows for further negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, making it seem more legitimate.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Bob's message leaves the door open for further discussions, showing flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high to me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a compromise, and it's a significant reduction from her initial offer. 
* **Value for Bob:**  This price is still within Bob's budget and allows him to save a considerable amount compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  While there's always the possibility of getting a lower price, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, especially if Alice is firm on her counteroffer. 

By accepting the offer, Bob secures a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing out on the product."
