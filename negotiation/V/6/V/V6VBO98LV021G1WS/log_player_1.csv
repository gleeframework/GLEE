Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to counteroffer, giving me more information about his perceived value and allowing me to adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $7,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value of $8,000, and I'm happy to accept it.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's not worth risking losing the sale completely."
