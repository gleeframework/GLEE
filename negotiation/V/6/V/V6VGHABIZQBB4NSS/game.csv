"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere. Let's make this happen!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit and gives you a fantastic opportunity to own this product.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still too far from what I can do. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident that you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
