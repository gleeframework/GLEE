"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic price, considering its true value to you is likely much higher.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we start the conversation at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While I agree the product is valuable, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could we settle on $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $725,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
