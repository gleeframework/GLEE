"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $900,000. This is the maximum I can afford at this time. I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet the price of $950,000. I would like to propose $925,000 as a compromise. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",925000.0,Bob,4,
