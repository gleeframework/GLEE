It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice at her asking price.  It's better to try and negotiate with her or move on to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product, which is what I'd pay John.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still above my maximum budget. It's time to go with the sure thing and buy from John for $800,000."
