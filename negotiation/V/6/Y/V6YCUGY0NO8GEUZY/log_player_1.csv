Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with the highest possible price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This sets a strong initial position and allows for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still keeping the value of the product in mind."
