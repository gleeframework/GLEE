Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable for you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the price.
* **Open Communication:** By inviting Bob's thoughts, I encourage dialogue and potential counter-offers.

This approach balances securing a good deal with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
