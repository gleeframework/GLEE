Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $13,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go below $13,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
