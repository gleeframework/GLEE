"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10500 is still a little above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10250.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
