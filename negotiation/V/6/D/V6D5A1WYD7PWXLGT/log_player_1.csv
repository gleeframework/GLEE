"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good starting point. I'll be open to negotiation, but I want to see if I can get a good price before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. I believe I can get a better price. I will counter with a higher offer and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm lowering my price by a smaller amount than Bob's initial offer, showing that I'm still confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10500 is still a little above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10250.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation. It's unlikely that we can reach a much higher price with further negotiations. Selling to John would yield less profit. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,250."
