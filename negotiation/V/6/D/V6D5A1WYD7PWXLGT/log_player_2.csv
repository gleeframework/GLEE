"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $2,000 more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower Price:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, indicating Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Realistic Offer:** $9,500 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and avoids animosity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob can buy from John for $10,000, there's still room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting, Bob can try to get closer to his target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still a little above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closer to Budget:** This counteroffer is significantly closer to Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Compromise Signal:** It demonstrates Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Polite Tone:** The friendly and encouraging tone encourages further negotiation."
