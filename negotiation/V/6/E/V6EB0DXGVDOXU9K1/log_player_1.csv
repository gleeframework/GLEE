Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get the highest price possible. While she has a guaranteed $12,000 from John, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high price ($15,000), Alice sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it makes subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob. Alice can then gradually reduce the price, still aiming to stay above her minimum of $12,000.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer to potentially get a higher price. If she wants to ensure a sale, she might offer a price closer to Bob's perceived value."
