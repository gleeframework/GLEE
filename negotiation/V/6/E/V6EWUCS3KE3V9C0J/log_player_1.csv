"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's far too low. While I'm aware he's my only current option, selling to him for $800,000 is a significant loss. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob understands the value of the product and is willing to meet me at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a higher price.  I'm aware we're running out of time and need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I still believe this is a fair price considering my minimum acceptable value. We're halfway through the rounds, and I need to start closing the gap to secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe there's potential for a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer again, trying to bridge the gap further.  However, with only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be mindful of the time and potential for selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's price point, but I'm still holding out for a higher amount. With only three rounds remaining, I need to be cautious and see if he's willing to compromise. If he doesn't, I might have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum.  I've been steadily decreasing my price, but I don't want to risk accepting a price lower than my minimum.  Selling to John at $1,200,000 ensures I get my desired price and avoids any further risk of losing money."
