"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $900,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your original price. How about we try $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
