Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for presenting the product. While I recognize its value, the price point of $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

This is a substantial jump, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in reaching an agreement.  I hope you'll consider it carefully.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a slow rate. He's still very far from our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's beneficial for us within the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations stalling indefinitely."
