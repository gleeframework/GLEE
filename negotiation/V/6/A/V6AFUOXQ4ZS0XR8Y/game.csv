"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting the product. While I recognize its value, the price point of $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for further negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true market value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the value and potential returns you'll gain from this unique product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, there's a significant gap between our valuations. I can increase my offer to $750,000.  This is a strong offer considering my budget constraints.  Let me know if you're open to revisiting your position.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some progress, but we're still quite far apart.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects a significant compromise while acknowledging the product's inherent value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  However, the price is still a major obstacle.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a substantial jump, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in reaching an agreement.  I hope you'll consider it carefully.",900000.0,Bob,6,
