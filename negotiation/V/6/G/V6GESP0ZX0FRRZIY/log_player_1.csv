Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could secure a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $14,500 is a strong offer that's still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000).  This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a good profit for Alice.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward, highlighting the value proposition for Bob."
