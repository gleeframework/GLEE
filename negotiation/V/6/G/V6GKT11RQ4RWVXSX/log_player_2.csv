"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,250,000. It's a steal considering its true value. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is overpriced. We have room to negotiate down towards a more favorable price."

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",

}
``` 

We start by countering with a significant reduction, aiming to bring the price closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's compromise.  How about we settle on $1,200,000?  This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows us to avoid a lengthy negotiation.

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. We'll continue to counter-offer to try and get a better deal."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000?"",

}
```

We acknowledge Alice's compromise and counter with a price that splits the difference between her latest offer and our previous counteroffer. This demonstrates our willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price."
