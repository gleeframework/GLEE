"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it provides significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $14,500 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price or you can buy from John for $15,000."
