{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $500,000 is a bold move,  but it's a strong starting point for negotiation.  This counteroffer signals Bob's serious intent to purchase while also setting a lower price point."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming to save even more. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  He has limited rounds, so he needs to be mindful of that, but there's still room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to meet Alice halfway.  Offering $650,000 shows he's serious about the deal and is willing to compromise. This is a strong counteroffer that demonstrates his willingness to close the deal, but he's still pushing for a lower price.  He is also aware that time is running out, but he doesn't want to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds left, Bob needs to be strategic. While he wants to save money, the risk of losing the deal altogether increases.  

* **Time constraint:**  Alice's offer is higher than his previous counteroffer, but he is getting closer to his target price.  
* **John's offer:**  $750,000 is significantly less than what John is charging. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If he rejects this offer and Alice doesn't come down further, he might have to buy from John at a much higher price.

Therefore, it is in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price lower than John's."
