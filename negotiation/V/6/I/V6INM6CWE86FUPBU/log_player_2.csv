{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is getting close to your maximum price point, there's still room for negotiation with 3 rounds remaining. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John.  You can continue to counteroffer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
