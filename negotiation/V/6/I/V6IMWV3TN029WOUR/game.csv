"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $12,000 to me, and I know you'd like to make a deal.  How about we start the negotiations closer to that figure? I'm willing to offer $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the time it takes for us to negotiate.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, so how about I meet you a little closer to your offer at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at $13,500? This is a fair price that balances out the value of the product to both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting closer. I can tell you're serious about making a deal.  To show you I am too, I'll come up to $11,500.  That's a very fair offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,500, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
