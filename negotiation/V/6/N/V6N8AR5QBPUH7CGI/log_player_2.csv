"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I believe a price of $10,000 is fair for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better deal. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price. This might encourage Alice to make a lower counter-offer, or you can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000."
