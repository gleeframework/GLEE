Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price to see if I can strike a deal quickly.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll keep in mind John's offer of $120 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, but it's closer than his initial assessment. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still above what Bob offered but is a compromise from my previous offer. I'm hoping that we can find a middle ground and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to offer $100. This is a final concession, and I'm hoping that Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'm going to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me to accept. While I'd prefer to get a better price, it's better to sell to John and guarantee my minimum acceptable price."
