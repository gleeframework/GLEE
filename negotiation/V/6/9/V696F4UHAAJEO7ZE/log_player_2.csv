"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a [Product Description] that I think you'd be very interested in. It's in excellent condition and I'm asking for [Product Price]. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Since you're willing to pay $15,000 for the product from John, and Alice is offering it for the same price, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer. You're not saving any money, but you're also not losing any by going with Alice."
