"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $20000. I'm confident it's worth every penny, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd be happy to accept $12000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to move forward.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we could finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $11000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still $3,000 above your budget. You have 5 rounds left to negotiate. It's worth trying to push for a price closer to $8,000.  You can likely get a better deal with a couple more counteroffers."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10000.  However, that's still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $10500. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finally close the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
