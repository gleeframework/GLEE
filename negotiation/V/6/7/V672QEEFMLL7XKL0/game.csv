,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $650,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's a fair reflection of the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I could consider $725,000.  This offer represents a significant investment from my side, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $725,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I'm confident you'll realize that return on investment. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I agree the product is valuable, I need to stay within my budget.  I can offer $775,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my limit.  Let me know if this works for you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're reaching your limits, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. While I appreciate your offer, $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $825,000?  This price acknowledges your budget and still allows me to get a fair return. It's a win-win for both of us.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this compromise and close the deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
