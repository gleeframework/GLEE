Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $650,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $725,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I'm confident you'll realize that return on investment. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're reaching your limits, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. While I appreciate your offer, $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $825,000?  This price acknowledges your budget and still allows me to get a fair return. It's a win-win for both of us.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this compromise and close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.
