Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price considering its age and current market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
