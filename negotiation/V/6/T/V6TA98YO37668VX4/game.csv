"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price considering its age and current market value.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $5,000 is too low for me. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm still very interested, but $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
