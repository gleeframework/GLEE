""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards, while still staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value and uniqueness helps justify the high asking price to Bob.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing for a bolder offer to Bob.

By offering the product at $925,000, Alice aims to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on it, while still leaving room for negotiation."
