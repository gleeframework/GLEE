"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $925,000 is higher than your maximum budget. 
* You know John will sell you the product for $1,000,000.
* While buying from John is your absolute limit, there's a chance Alice might lower her price if you reject the initial offer. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave the door open for a potential counter-offer that might be closer to your desired price range."
