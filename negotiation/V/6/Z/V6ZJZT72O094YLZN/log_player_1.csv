{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to get as close to my minimum as possible. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $13,000 is a decent starting point, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and far from my initial offer of $13,000. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have room to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my goal.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and keep the potential for a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm lowering my price to show flexibility, but still staying well above Bob's offer. 
* **Focus on value:**  The message highlights the value of the product to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I leave the door open for further discussion to potentially reach a deal.

This counteroffer maintains my leverage, allows for continued negotiation, and keeps the potential for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. It's a good product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my personal value of the product. 
* **John's offer is significantly better:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a much higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Limited potential for further negotiation:**  Bob is already at his maximum budget, suggesting there's little room for him to increase his offer.

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, I choose to sell to him and secure the highest possible profit."
