Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for Alice. It's important to be confident and express the value of the product in the message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to the minimum acceptable price for Alice, it's still below what Alice wants. Rejecting allows Alice to try and get closer to her target price by sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,650,000?  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to consider $1,625,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is close to Alice's target price of $1,650,000 and still allows for a profit. It's a good deal for both parties, and accepting will prevent further negotiation and the risk of Bob ultimately rejecting a counteroffer."
