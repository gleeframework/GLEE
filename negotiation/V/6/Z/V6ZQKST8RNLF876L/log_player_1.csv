Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $12,000 is a significant discount from my ""public"" price, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $12,000 offer leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. It keeps me above my minimum while still potentially securing a quick sale."
