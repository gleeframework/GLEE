"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message signals a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the process.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly below both your minimum ($1,200,000) and his perceived value ($1,500,000). Accepting this offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. 

While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. There's room to counter-offer and work towards a price closer to both of your valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential impact for you. I'm confident it can generate far more value for your business.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** The message politely explains why the previous offer was too low, emphasizing the value Bob would miss out on.
* **Significant Concession:** Coming down by $100,000 signals a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his range.
* **Firm but Fair:** The language remains confident and emphasizes fairness, reinforcing the value proposition.

This counteroffer aims to bring Bob closer to the middle ground while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still below your safety net of $1,200,000 with John. While Bob is clearly negotiating, there's still potential to push for a better price in the remaining rounds. 

We are now close enough to your minimum that the risk of continuing to negotiate is less concerning."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground.  While $1,175,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $1,240,000? I believe this is a fair and final offer."",
""product_price"": 1240000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Appreciation & Acknowledgement:** The message starts by recognizing Bob's efforts, maintaining a positive tone. 
* **Firm Stance:** The language shifts to be more assertive, indicating this is a serious offer close to the bottom line.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,240,000 is a strong position:
    * Above your safety net ($1,200,000 with John)
    *  Significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000)
    * Gives a small concession but not too much
* **""Fair and Final"":** This wording creates a sense of urgency and signals that you're not willing to go much lower.

This approach aims to secure a favorable deal while still allowing Bob to feel like he's negotiated a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the response. I understand it's a valuable product. To be honest, my budget limit is $1,200,000. If you can do that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  If not, I wish you all the best. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your absolute minimum price, which also matches what John is offering.  While there might be a tiny bit of room left to negotiate, it's highly unlikely Bob will budge further. Accepting now guarantees you the best possible outcome in this scenario."
