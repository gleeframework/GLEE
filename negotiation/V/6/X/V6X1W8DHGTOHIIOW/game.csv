"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential benefits to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to move the product and me to secure something valuable within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price is closer to my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,050,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone, I'm willing to meet halfway and offer $975,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to move the product and me to acquire a valuable asset. Let's reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,025,000. This price is still a compromise, but I believe it's closer to the product's true value.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $990,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's conclude this deal.",990000.0,Bob,8,
