"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, but still gives you a good value. Let me know your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you and gives me a better return on my investment. Let's try to find a middle ground here. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
