"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's below your maximum, there's significant room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than I'd like to pay. I can potentially get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
