Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum desired value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $14,000 is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves space for him to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the value of the product to Bob in my message helps him understand why this price is justified. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and positive. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer or switch to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Counteroffer Potential:** While John is willing to pay my full asking price, I still have room to negotiate with Bob.  A counteroffer might lead to a compromise closer to my desired price.
* **Risk-Reward Calculation:**  Although there's a risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer, the potential reward of securing a price closer to $15,000 outweighs the risk of accepting his initial offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation alive and striving for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a compromise by meeting Bob halfway. My counteroffer of $13,000 is a significant decrease from my initial price but still above Bob's offer.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone in my message helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that he's getting a good deal even at this price.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our initial positions and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to either counteroffer again or move on to John if the price remains too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Even though he claims it's his final offer, there's no guarantee that further negotiation would yield a better result.
* **Time is a Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John, who is willing to pay my desired price. 
* **Secure the Best Outcome:**  Selling to John ensures I receive the full value of the product, guaranteeing a financially successful outcome.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob if possible, the potential loss from accepting his offer is too great. By choosing John, I secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, making it the most logical and financially sound decision."
