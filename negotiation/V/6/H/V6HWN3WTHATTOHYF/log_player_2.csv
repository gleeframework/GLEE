Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for a product of this value. What do you think?

It's unlikely Alice will go below $1,000,000 and John is offering the product at that price.  It's time to cut the negotiation with Alice short."
