"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can still potentially save money.  You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from $10,000, but I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,800, which is a great price considering you value the product at $10,000.  You are only paying $800 more than Alice values the product at. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your offer again and you might end up paying the full $10,000 to John.  It's a better strategy to accept the current offer and secure a good deal."
