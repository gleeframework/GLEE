"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($1,050,000) than Alice's asking price ($1,400,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:**  While starting low, I don't want to insult Alice with an unreasonably low offer.  Offering a bit over half her asking price seems like a reasonable starting point.
* **Alternative Option:**  I always have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000, so I won't go above that price with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to $1,250,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to my acceptable range, but she's still above my fallback option of buying from John. I'll keep negotiating to see if I can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate the movement. To be honest,  $1,125,000 is the highest I can go. It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that splits the difference between her latest offer ($1,250,000) and my previous offer ($1,050,000).  This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency to encourage Alice to accept.  I want her to know that I'm serious but also that I have other options.
* **Below John's Price:**  I'm still aiming to stay below my maximum price of $1,200,000 (John's offer)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm thinking of a price closer to $1,200,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched John's price of $1,200,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as she's unlikely to go any lower. It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John."
