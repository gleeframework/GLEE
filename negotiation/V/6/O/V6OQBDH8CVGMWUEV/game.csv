,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8750. Let's make this deal happen.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8750 and $7500, which would be $8125. Can you consider that?",8125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8125 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8125 and $8750, which would be $8437.50. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",8437.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $8218.75, which would be $8109.375. Can you consider that?",8109.375,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8109.38 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down just a little further, to $8150. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move on to another buyer. Let's close this deal!",8150.0,Alice,9,
