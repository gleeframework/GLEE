Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll also keep John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8,750. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8750 and $7500, which would be $8125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,125 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired price point.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, so I want to see if I can get closer to my target.  I'll continue to counter Bob's offers, while keeping John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8125 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8125 and $8750, which would be $8437.50. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 8437.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my budget. How about we try $8000? That's the maximum I can go, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not quite enough.  I have 4 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more. I'm also keeping John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to come closer to my price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,437.50, which would be $8,218.75.  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8218.75}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $8218.75, which would be $8109.375. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,109.38 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down just a little further, to $8,150. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move on to another buyer. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8150}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, I'm getting closer to my minimum value and am willing to concede a bit more. This is my final offer. If Bob rejects it, I'll move on to John, ensuring I get a better price than what Bob is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8150 and $8000, which would be $8075. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,075. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,075
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Bob's offer of $8,075 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm not willing to risk losing the sale to John, who is offering a much better price. I will choose to sell to John to maximize my profit."
