"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for the same price, there's no immediate incentive to accept her offer.  You can reject the offer and still purchase the product from John for the same price.  

This strategy gives you more information:

* **Potential for Negotiation:** You could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice if you reject her offer.  She might be willing to lower her price to make the sale.
* **Opportunity to Compare:**  You could see if John has a better offer or product features. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you maintain your best possible outcome while keeping your options open."
