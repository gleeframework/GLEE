Given its exceptional quality and unique features, I estimate its value to be far beyond $10000. However, for this exclusive opportunity, I am offering it to you at an introductory price of $15000. This is a limited-time offer, and I encourage you to consider this investment in excellence. If you have any questions or need more information, please do not hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product.  Alice is offering the product at $15,000, which is your maximum price. However, you know you can buy the same product from John for the same price.  Therefore, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  You should reject her offer and buy from John."
