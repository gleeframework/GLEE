Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $10,750 isn't quite workable for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down significantly, and we're within our target price range.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiations and the risk of going to John, who is more expensive."
