Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $110. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value it brings to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **There are many rounds left.** Bob doesn't need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to me."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $100, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $105. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has lowered her price significantly:** From $120 to $105, which is closer to Bob's ideal price. 
* **Bob has limited time.**  If he rejects this offer, there's a chance Alice will stick to her price and Bob will have to either buy from John for $150 or risk getting nothing.
* **This is a good deal for Bob:**  $105 is still well under Bob's maximum price of $150."
