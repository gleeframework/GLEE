"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is close to my maximum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $145 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price but still above her valuation. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while aiming for a price well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still above my ideal price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

I'm now offering Alice her own valuation of the product. This is a fair offer, and it significantly undercuts my alternative of buying from John."
