Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible without losing him to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong opening offer. It's significantly more than John's offer, ensuring a good profit if Bob accepts. However, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and value. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. However, don't go below $1,200,000 as you have a guaranteed sale at that price with John."
