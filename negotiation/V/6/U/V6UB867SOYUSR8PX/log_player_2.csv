"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a lower price, aiming to find a middle ground.  A $500 reduction is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there is still room for further negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price before having to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate.  A $100 increase from his previous offer is a small step, demonstrating his willingness to compromise but also showing that he's not willing to accept Alice's last offer just yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still slightly above his target. There are still rounds left, so rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better price without resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7150}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's offer while still trying to save some money. A $50 increase from his previous offer demonstrates his willingness to compromise but also keeps some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,300 is only $300 more than Bob's last counteroffer and is still significantly less than John's price of $8,000.  With only three rounds remaining, it's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product.  There is a chance Bob could get a slightly lower price in the next round, but there is also the risk Alice might counter with a higher price or even reject the offer. Accepting now minimizes risk and gets Bob a good deal."
