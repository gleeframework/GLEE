"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, and $105 is a reasonable starting point for his counteroffer. This price is still below his maximum limit of $120 and leaves room for negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is now within Bob's price range of $120. Accepting the offer would allow Bob to buy the product for less than what John is selling it for.  While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are minimal, and it's likely Alice won't go lower significantly. It's better to secure the product at a decent price rather than risk going through more rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up paying more."
