Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:** A high initial offer will gauge how eager Bob is to purchase. If he accepts immediately, you know there was potential for an even higher price. If he negotiates, you can work your way down towards your minimum. 
* **John as Leverage:**  While you won't mention John directly, knowing you have a backup buyer gives you confidence in negotiations. You don't *need* to sell to Bob, so you're in a stronger position."
