"Alice,  $2,300,000 is way out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $2,300,000 is closer to the product's true value.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the significant potential this product holds for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle,  Let's split the difference at $1,500,000. This price would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
