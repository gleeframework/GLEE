Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my own. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly implying the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Alternative:**  I always have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,100,000. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is significantly higher than his initially stated value of $800,000. This indicates he's very interested and willing to stretch his budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a considerable gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price, but also a gap between his offer and my initial ask. This suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** I still have the safety net of selling to John for my desired price if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, that price point is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me at $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've come down by $50,000 from my initial offer, signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate. Bob offered $150,000 more than his initial valuation, so asking him to meet halfway seems fair. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still holding the price well above Bob's perceived value to maintain the product's worth in his eyes. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps me in a strong position for future rounds of negotiation, as I can still afford to lower the price slightly if needed, while remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $1,050,000 is still slightly beyond my current budget. I am proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant amount above his initial valuation and demonstrates a strong commitment to acquiring the product.
* **Profitable Deal:** While I could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer secures a profit of $1,000,000, which is a substantial return.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away altogether. Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
