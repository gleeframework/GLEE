"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,100,000. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, that price point is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $1,050,000 is still slightly beyond my current budget. I am proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
