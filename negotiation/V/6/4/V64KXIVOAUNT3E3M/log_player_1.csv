Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between what Bob values it at and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to $1,200,000 without being so high that Bob would rather walk away.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically.
* **Confident Price:**  $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit margin ($150,000) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($50,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong starting point, there's some room to negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back, but not below your $1,000,000 minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one offer strategy. You could start higher and be prepared to negotiate more aggressively. The key is to balance confidence with a realistic understanding of Bob's perspective."
