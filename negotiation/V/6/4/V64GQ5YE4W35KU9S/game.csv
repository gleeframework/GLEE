"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1,300,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose $1,150,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
