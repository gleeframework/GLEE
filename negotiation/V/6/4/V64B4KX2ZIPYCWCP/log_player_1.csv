"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the price as being tied to the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth even more than Bob realizes.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm making it clear I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the opportunity to consider this product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the value you place on it. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. This amount aligns more closely with my valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than John's, but still significantly below my target. I believe there's room for negotiation, so I'll reject this offer and try to guide him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the valuation, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000.  This offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Ground:** I'm lowering my price by $150,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's potential beyond his initial assessment to justify the higher price. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price closer to the midpoint between our previous offers, encouraging Bob to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given your proposal careful consideration, Alice. While I respect your position, I still feel that the product's value aligns more closely with my assessment. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,900,000. This amount aims to bridge the gap while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob has increased his offer substantially.  However, $1,900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm firm but willing to continue negotiating.  I'll aim for a counteroffer that keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer demonstrates a serious interest in the product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is fairly recognized."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between our last two offers. This signals fairness and a strong desire to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using phrases like ""working with me"" and ""solution that works for both of us"" to foster a collaborative atmosphere. 
* **Final Push:** While I'm open to further negotiation, this offer is getting close to my walk-away point. Bob needs to make a significant move if we're going to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose an offer of $1,850,000. This amount aims to reflect a compromise that respects both the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting this offer gives me a $350,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer. It's a strong deal and not worth risking further negotiation for a relatively small potential gain."
