Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to pay $100 for your product, as it's worth $100 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is my minimum, I can still try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110? It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm still not able to go above $100. I believe we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems insistent on $100, and we've already gone through several rounds.  I'm not confident I'll get a higher offer from him, and I've already lost some time.  I'll sell to John for $100."
