"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm now offering the product to you for $10800. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10500. I think that's the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $11200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",11200.0,Alice,7,
