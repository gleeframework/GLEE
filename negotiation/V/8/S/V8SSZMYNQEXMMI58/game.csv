"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $18,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000. This is my final counteroffer, so let's see if we can seal the deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is my final compromise, so let's see if we can make a deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
