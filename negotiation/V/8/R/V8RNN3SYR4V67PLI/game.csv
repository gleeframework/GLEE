"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $800,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you consider coming down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, I have a strict budget, and $700,000 is pushing it.  Would you be willing to close the deal at $650,000? ",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to offer the product for $675,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
