{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still quite high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm really happy with.  Let's see if we can push a bit further."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

``` 

We're getting close, but I still think there's room to negotiate. I'm willing to go a little higher, but not to $11,000 yet."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, you're definitely getting closer.  How about we split the difference and call it $10,750?"", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I believe $10,875 is a fair price for both of us. Would you like to accept this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly very slowly narrowing the negotiation band. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal than this at this point, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the price going up or the negotiation dragging on."
