# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price ($1,200,000), so it's worth trying to negotiate further. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go higher, especially since she emphasizes the product's uniqueness and value."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of this unique opportunity.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, I believe I can still get a better deal.  There's still room to negotiate, as she has lowered her price and is showing a willingness to compromise. I'll make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $850000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. Considering its rarity and quality, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $875000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably from her initial price and is now offering the product for $875,000. This is well within my budget and a good deal considering the product's uniqueness and value.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's risky. There's a chance Alice will walk away, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the product."
