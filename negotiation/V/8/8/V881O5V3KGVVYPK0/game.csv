"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower. Given the market and my budget, I'm willing to pay $800000 for this unique product. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of this unique opportunity.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value of this unique product, I'm willing to offer $850000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity, and it's the highest I can go at this moment. I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $850000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. Considering its rarity and quality, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $875000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
