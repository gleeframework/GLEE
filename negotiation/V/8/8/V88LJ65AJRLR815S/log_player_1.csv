"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $13,000.  I'm open to discussing further, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $13,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle - how about $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $9,500.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise given our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above his current offer of $9,500.  We're in Round 4, and he's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Continuing negotiations with Bob has a high risk of wasting time and yielding a less favorable outcome than John's guaranteed offer."
