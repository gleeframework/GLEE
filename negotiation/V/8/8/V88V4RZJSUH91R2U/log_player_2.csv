"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  Offering $9,500 is a reasonable starting point for his counteroffer.  It's a good compromise between his budget and Alice's likely minimum. This offer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has countered with the same price Bob offered in round 2. This indicates she's willing to meet him halfway. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely or being forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer secures the product for $9,500, which is within Bob's budget and a significant savings compared to John's price."
