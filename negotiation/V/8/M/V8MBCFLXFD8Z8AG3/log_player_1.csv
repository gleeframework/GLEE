Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the value the product has for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I use language that indicates I'm open to negotiating, which could lead to a better outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a new counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $10500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below my minimum desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, considering the product's value to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $11,500.
* I will carefully consider Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate further or accept his offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit low considering the value this product holds for you. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Re-emphasize Value:** I again remind Bob of the product's value to him to justify my price.
* **Fairness:** I frame the offer as a fair compromise for both parties. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my options:
    * **Accept his offer:** If I'm close to my minimum and don't want to risk further negotiation.
    * **Make another counteroffer:** If I believe I can get a slightly higher price.
    * **Sell to John:** If I'm not confident of reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11000. Would you be willing to consider $10750? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to walk away. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could consume valuable time, which could be spent securing other sales opportunities.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and minimize the risk of losing the deal. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a profitable outcome."
