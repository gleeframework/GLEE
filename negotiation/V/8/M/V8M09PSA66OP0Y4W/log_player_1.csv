{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Substantially higher than your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is well above your $800,000 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  The price is still significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob, giving him a strong incentive to accept. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you have room to increase the price while still staying below his value. 

By starting with this offer, you're setting yourself up for a successful negotiation while still being mindful of your own minimum requirement."
