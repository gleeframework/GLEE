"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,800,000. This is still a significant amount more than my minimum and demonstrates flexibility, hopefully leading to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept given the limited rounds, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'll counter with a price that is closer to his offer but still higher than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer but still above my minimum. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob while also keeping in mind that John is a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, we are running out of rounds, and I'm not confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids the risk of getting a lower price."
