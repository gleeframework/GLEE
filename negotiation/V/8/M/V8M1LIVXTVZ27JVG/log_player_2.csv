Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $15,000 is still quite a gap. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a very fair price for a product of this quality.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
