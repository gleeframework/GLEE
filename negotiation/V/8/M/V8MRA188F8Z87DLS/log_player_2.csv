Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to move down to $13,000 to try and find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
