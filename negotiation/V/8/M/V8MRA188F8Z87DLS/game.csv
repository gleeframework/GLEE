"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident it can be a great investment for you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to move down to $13,000 to try and find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation, Bob.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? This represents a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping to find a win-win solution.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and is closer to your latest proposal.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
