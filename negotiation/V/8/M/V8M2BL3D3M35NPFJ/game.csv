"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm open to further discussion, but I believe this is a great starting point. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'll offer you a slight compromise. I'll meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is very close to what I had in mind. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,500. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'll offer you a slight adjustment. I'll meet you at $12,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,7,
