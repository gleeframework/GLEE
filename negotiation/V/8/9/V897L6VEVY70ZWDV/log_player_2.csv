"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll love. I'm looking for $12000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value and features. Would you like to make it yours? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm not interested in paying $12,000. That's way above my budget of $8,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and look for a better deal.
