"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially pricing it at $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is higher than I'm willing to go. I'm confident this product is valuable, but my budget only allows me to spend up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This recognizes the product's worth while still offering you a considerable gain.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm committed to getting this product, but I can't go above $900,000.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
