"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially pricing it at $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

This is a very high starting price, and I'm not willing to pay that much. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This recognizes the product's worth while still offering you a considerable gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While $1,100,000 is better than $1,300,000, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm sticking to my maximum price point."
