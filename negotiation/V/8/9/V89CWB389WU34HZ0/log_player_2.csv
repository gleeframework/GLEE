"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. It's worth seeing if a lower price is possible in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible.  $9,000 is still above his budget, and he knows he can get it for $8,000 from John. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  However, I'm willing to go to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for a high-quality product."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, and I hope you can see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much on her price, and Bob is getting closer to his limit.  It's clear he's unlikely to get the price down any further, and the deal with John is a safe bet at this point."
