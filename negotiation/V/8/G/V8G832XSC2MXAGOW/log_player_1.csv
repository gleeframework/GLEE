"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,300,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  I frame the high price by emphasizing the product's ""unique value and potential."" This suggests there are benefits Bob might not be fully aware of, potentially justifying the high cost.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price signals I'm open to negotiation but won't settle for anything significantly lower than my desired range.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:** Ideally, Bob accepts the high price.
2. **Understand Bob's position:** His response will reveal how much he values the product and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate.
3. **Maintain the option of John:** If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can walk away and sell to John for my guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm better off negotiating further or selling to John. 

**Strategy for Round 3:**

I'll make a counteroffer closer to my minimum but still above it, aiming to:

* **Signal flexibility:** Show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  Avoid dropping the price too drastically too soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, the value of this product is substantial, and I need to get closer to $1,800,000 for it. I'm willing to be flexible, but that's a more realistic price point."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I lower my price by $500,000, a significant amount designed to show Bob I'm open to negotiation.
* **Above Minimum:**  The new price is still comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum and provides room for further bargaining.
* **Justification:** I reiterate the product's value without directly dismissing Bob's perspective.
* **Call to Action:** By stating ""I'm willing to be flexible,"" I encourage Bob to continue the negotiation and hopefully move closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,400,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob stating this is his final offer adds pressure, but it also suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Limited Rounds:** We have six rounds left, but there's no guarantee of reaching a better deal. Accepting now secures a profit. 

While I could push for a higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and leaving me with only John's $1,500,000 offer is too significant at this point. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profit above my minimum and avoids a potential loss of $100,000."
