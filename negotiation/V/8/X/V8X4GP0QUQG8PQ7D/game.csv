"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've presented, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product.  This reflects my current budget and understanding of its market value.  I'm open to further discussion.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $820000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $820000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land closer to my initial offer of $700000.  I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is a significant jump for me.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $790000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",790000.0,Alice,5,
