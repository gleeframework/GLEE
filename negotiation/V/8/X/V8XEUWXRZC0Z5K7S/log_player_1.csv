Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product for a limited time. I think it would be perfect for your needs.  I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, trying to sell to Bob first allows me to potentially make an extra $1,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 is a significant discount from my ""walk-away"" price but still a substantial profit over Bob's perceived value.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
