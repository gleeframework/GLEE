"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $150. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I believe that's a fair price considering its worth to you is $100, and I'm willing to make a compromise.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $80 is quite low for the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $120? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $90 is still too low.  How about we settle at $110? That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $90, so I'll offer $100. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,6,
