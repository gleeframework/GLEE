Round 2

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's ideal price is lower, Alice's offer of $13,200 is getting closer to his desired price.  Considering the limited rounds remaining and the risk of Alice becoming less flexible, accepting the offer is the best option. It allows Bob to secure the product at a price lower than John's offer and within his budget."
