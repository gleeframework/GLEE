"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  He's better off continuing to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his desired $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still not quite there at $11,000.  How about we split the difference and I offer $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his desired $10,500.  While $11,200 is a better offer than before, it's still higher than he's comfortable with. He's better off continuing to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. However, $11,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Let's try $10,900.  I believe this price is fair for both of us and will allow us to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll sell it to you for $11,100. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice has made concessions, and her current offer is getting closer to Bob's target price.
* **Time Pressure:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and Bob only has 3 rounds left. 
* **Alternative Cost:**  Buying from John would cost $12,000, and Alice's offer is lower than that.

While Bob might prefer a slightly lower price, accepting this offer secures the product for a better price than going to John and only leaves 3 rounds for further negotiations, which could risk losing the deal altogether."
