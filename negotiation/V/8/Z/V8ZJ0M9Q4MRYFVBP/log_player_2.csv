"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really value. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  What do you think about $100? Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget ($120), you know you have another option with John. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of getting a better price. You're willing to risk not getting the product from Alice if it means potentially saving $20 by going with John."
