"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely useful. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still below my maximum budget.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
