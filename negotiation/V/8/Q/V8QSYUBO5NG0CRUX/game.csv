"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,600,000 is unfortunately well above my budget.  Given the value of $1,000,000 to me, I'm willing to offer you $1,100,000.  This represents a significant price for me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is understandable, the value of this product to the right buyer is undeniable.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still constrained by my budget. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  Let's find a solution that works for both sides.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
