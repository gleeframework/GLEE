Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget.  While it's tempting to consider since it's closer to my max, I still want to try and negotiate further. It's possible I can get a price closer to $1,100,000 or even lower."
