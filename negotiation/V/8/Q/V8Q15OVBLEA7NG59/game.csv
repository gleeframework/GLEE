"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $875000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I've already compromised a lot, and I think the product's value is worth more. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $860000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",860000.0,Alice,5,
