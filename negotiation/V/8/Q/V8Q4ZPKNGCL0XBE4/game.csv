"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 falls quite a bit short of what I had in mind.  This product's potential is immense, and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more like $950,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle on $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about $925,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best price possible.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but your most recent offer doesn't accurately reflect the value this product offers. I'm open to negotiating, but I need to see a more serious offer on the table. How about $960,000?",960000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product has a lot of value, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $930,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",930000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're so close to a deal! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we wrap this up right now at $945,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  What do you say?",945000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $920,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the product. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",920000.0,Bob,10,
