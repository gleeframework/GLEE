Round 4

You have three options:

We're still doing well. Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate.  We have room to push back further."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is trying to lowball us after we split the difference in the previous round. This shows us that he's willing to go higher, and we haven't reached his upper limit yet.  We'll push back firmly but fairly in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but your most recent offer doesn't accurately reflect the value this product offers. I'm open to negotiating, but I need to see a more serious offer on the table. How about $960,000?"",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product has a lot of value, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $930,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can agree on a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob stating his offer is ""as high as I'm willing to go"" is likely a negotiation tactic. We're getting close, but it's worth pushing a little further, especially with only a couple of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're so close to a deal! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we wrap this up right now at $945,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 945000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting down to the wire, and it's time to incentivize Bob to close the deal now.  By presenting this offer as our final concession and emphasizing the mutual benefit, we increase the pressure to accept without seeming overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $920,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the product. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While it's frustrating that Bob didn't meet our target price, accepting his final offer of $920,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Constraint:** This is the final round.  Rejecting his offer means we lose the deal with Bob and have to settle for John's $800,000 offer.
* **Profitable, Though Not Ideal:** $920,000 is significantly above our minimum acceptable price and still represents a substantial profit.
* **Uncertainty of Further Negotiation:** Even if we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Bob would go any higher. He might be firm on his ""final offer.""

It's always a judgment call to accept a less-than-ideal offer, but in this scenario, the risks of holding out don't outweigh the benefits of securing a very good deal now."
