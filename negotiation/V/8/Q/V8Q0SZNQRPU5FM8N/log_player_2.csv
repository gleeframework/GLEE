Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and establish a starting point for further discussions.  He's hoping to land a price closer to his budget, but is prepared to go higher if necessary."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. He should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further."

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing his willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. He's aiming for a price that is closer to his maximum limit but still allows room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where the negotiation is becoming too close to his maximum budget. Alice's latest offer of $17,000 is only $5,000 lower than her initial price, indicating a stubbornness to negotiate further.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John at $12,000, ensuring a significant saving and avoiding further negotiation that may not yield a favorable outcome."
