"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's a significant margin between her valuation and mine. I should make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?"",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it gives us room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Demonstrating Interest:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest, which is important for keeping the negotiation going. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  By starting low, we signal that we're looking for a good deal, but we're also open to meeting Alice somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is a good sign. However, $700,000 is still significantly higher than her known valuation. There's room to haggle further and try to secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. How about $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** We're moving in smaller increments now, signaling that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer probes Alice's willingness to move further down from her previous offer. 
* **Still Below Reserve:** It's crucial to stay well below our $1,500,000 reserve, aiming for a deal that benefits us significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to a number you're comfortable with. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you at $650,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably, and while we might squeeze out a bit more, the difference is becoming less significant. $650,000 represents a substantial saving compared to John's offer, and further haggling risks pushing Alice away. It's a good deal, and it's time to secure the purchase."
