I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still less than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate and allows me to gauge his interest while leaving myself room to counter if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round. While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."

I'm counteroffering Bob at $950,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that encourages Bob to accept, while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. It's a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still a good price for me, considering my minimum price. If he rejects this, I will sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough.  I've already made several concessions and it's clear we're not going to agree on a price that satisfies both of us. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
