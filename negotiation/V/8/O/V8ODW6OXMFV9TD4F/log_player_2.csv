"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for your product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within a range where Bob might be willing to buy. It also demonstrates that Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.  The message is friendly and avoids being aggressive, hoping to keep the negotiation open."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering its value to me.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Bob is determined to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
