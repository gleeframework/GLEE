Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's perceived value of $120 as possible!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to $100,  $90 is still a good price and I'm confident I can't do much better with Bob.  It's also better than selling to John for $80."
