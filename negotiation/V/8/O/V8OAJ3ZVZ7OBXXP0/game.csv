"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway at $1500000?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
