Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think it would be a great value for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Don't undervalue:**  Starting at Bob's maximum value ($120) leaves no room for negotiation and might make him suspicious. 
* **Aim for a win-win:**  Offering the product for $135 gives Bob a chance to get it for $15 less than its worth to him, while you still earn $15 more than selling it to John.
* **Leave room for adjustment:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can potentially lower the price slightly in a follow-up, knowing John guarantees you $150."
