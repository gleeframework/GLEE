Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  At this point, the price is getting very close to his maximum budget, and the risk of further negotiation failing is high.  He can get the product from John for a lower price, so it's more advantageous to buy from John."
