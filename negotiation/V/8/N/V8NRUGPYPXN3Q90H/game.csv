,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to keep costs down.",122.5,Bob,4,
