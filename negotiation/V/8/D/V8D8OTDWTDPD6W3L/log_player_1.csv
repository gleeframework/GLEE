I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're getting close to the end of the rounds and Bob's offer isn't getting high enough to justify continuing negotiations.  While I would prefer to have made a slightly higher profit, securing a sale at $120 is better than risking a deal falling through."
