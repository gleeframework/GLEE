"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget. While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to meet you halfway. This still allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm going to counteroffer at $13,500. Can you consider this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
