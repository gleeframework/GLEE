"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its value, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to counter with an offer of $850,000. This price reflects the product's value to me and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counter with an offer of $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my end. This price still allows for a healthy profit for you, while remaining within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your position, $920,000 is still beyond my comfortable price point. I'm prepared to go up to $890,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's aim for a final compromise to close this deal.",890000.0,Bob,6,
