Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find really valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John is a guaranteed $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, bringing the price closer to $150.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the product is only worth $100 to Bob, pricing it slightly above his perceived value creates a sense of potential deal and encourages negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, this strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
