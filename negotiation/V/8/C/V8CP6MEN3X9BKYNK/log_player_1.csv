"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000, to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point to see if he values the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. It's too risky to accept, as I could potentially get a better price later. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $12,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial asking price. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also staying above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offer, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $10,000. This is still above my minimum value but shows a willingness to compromise. If Bob is serious about buying the product, I think he will be willing to meet me in the middle somewhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value. I have 4 rounds remaining, and I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm making a slight counteroffer of $9,800. This is just below my minimum value but shows I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as we are getting close to a deal and I have fewer rounds left."
