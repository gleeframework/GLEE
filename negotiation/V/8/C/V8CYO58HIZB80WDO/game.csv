"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get the deal done. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value I think the product holds, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. That's a good move, but I'm still stuck at $8,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can make this work. ",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still at $8,000, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product at this price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I know you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm very serious about buying this product, but $8,000 is the absolute most I can spend. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product at this price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
