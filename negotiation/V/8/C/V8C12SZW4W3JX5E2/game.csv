"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for this product. This reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
