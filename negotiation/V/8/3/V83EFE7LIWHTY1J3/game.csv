"Alice, $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. Let me make you a counteroffer: I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. It's a fair price considering its value and quality, and I think it's a good compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but I won't go any higher.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $14000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $16000. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a good compromise considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $16000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $15000. This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I will buy from John.",15000.0,Bob,6,
