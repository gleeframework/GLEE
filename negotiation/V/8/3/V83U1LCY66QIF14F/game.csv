"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're serious about making a deal. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a significant step up from my last offer and should be a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss the details.",900000.0,Alice,5,
