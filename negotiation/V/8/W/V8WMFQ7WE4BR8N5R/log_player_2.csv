Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,000,000, but I'm afraid it's a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,300,000, and I'm unwilling to pay more than John's price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
