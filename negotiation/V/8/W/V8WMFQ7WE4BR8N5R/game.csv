"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I am interested in the product, the price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,000,000, but I'm afraid it's a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's worth every penny.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the reply. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, the price is still a little steep for me.  How about $1,125,000?  That's a fair compromise, splitting the difference between our last two offers.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
