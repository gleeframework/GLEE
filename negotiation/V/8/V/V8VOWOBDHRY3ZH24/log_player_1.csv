Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its potential returns. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, maximizing profit means trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($950,000) leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, framing the price as an investment opportunity. This approach aims to make the offer more enticing to Bob."
