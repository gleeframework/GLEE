{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming high with the initial offer, hoping to capture a good chunk of the potential surplus value for myself.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using positive language to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While $1,000,000 is my ideal price, I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary. 
* **Safeguard:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I won't settle for less than my minimum value of $800,000.

This strategy balances the need to maximize profits with the need to be flexible during negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but still not ideal.** While I'm happy he's showing interest, $900,000 is still $100,000 less than my initial offer.
* **I want to see if I can push for a higher price.** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk rejecting his offer to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **My backup plan with John provides safety.**  I'm not desperate and can always sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next steps:** I'll need to craft a counteroffer that balances my desire for a higher price with the risk of Bob walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're both serious about this deal.  While $900,000 is closer, I can't go that low just yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I'm acknowledging his offer and showing that I'm taking his perspective into consideration.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm suggesting a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm focusing on a ""win-win"" scenario where both of us are happy with the outcome.
* **Direct call to action:** I'm prompting Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

By meeting in the middle and emphasizing a positive outcome, I hope to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer and secure a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $20,000 away from my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.
* **Limited room for improvement:**  Considering Bob's consistent negotiation and his rejection of my previous counteroffer,  it's unlikely he'll budge much further.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations could lead to a stalemate or even his withdrawal, forcing me to sell to John at a lower price.

**In this scenario, it's wiser to accept Bob's offer and secure a decent profit, rather than risking a lower sale price or losing the deal altogether.**"
