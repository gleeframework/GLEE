Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's estimated value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **""Great deal""**: This phrase is used to emphasize the value proposition for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open-ended question:**  ""Let me know if you're interested!"" encourages Bob to respond and allows him to make a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I aim to:

* **Maximize my profits:** I'm getting closer to my minimum target of $1,200,000.
* **Encourage negotiation:** The offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but not so high that he'll immediately accept. This sets up a negotiation where we can both potentially improve our position.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can always move on to John and secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I am still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get closer to my target of $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still a gap between Bob's offer ($900,000) and my minimum value ($1,200,000).  Rejecting his offer opens the door for further negotiations.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting the offer, I demonstrate my commitment to achieving a higher price. This puts pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired range.
* **Option to sell to John:**  Even if the negotiations with Bob fall through, I can always sell to John for my minimum value, so I have a safety net.

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price. How about $950,000? It's a fair compromise and gives you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, aiming for a middle ground. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Compromise language:**  ""Fair compromise"" and ""great deal""  emphasize the mutually beneficial nature of the potential agreement.
* **Open-ended question:** ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

By offering $950,000, I'm:

* **Moving closer to my goal:** This price is closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000.
* **Showing flexibility:** My counteroffer demonstrates that I am willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining pressure:** I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, but I'm also not rejecting him outright. This keeps the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll carefully consider my next move. I might make another counteroffer, try to understand his reasoning for rejecting, or even move on to John if it becomes clear that a deal with Bob is unlikely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your original price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting very close to my minimum target of $1,200,000.  Given the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price, or the need to move on to John and risk a lower price, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision.

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant profit:**  Even at $925,000, I'm making a substantial profit on the product. 
* **Risk of rejection:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll come back with a higher counteroffer.
* **Time factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer and increase the risk of a deal falling through completely.

**Conclusion:**

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most financially sound choice. It ensures a substantial profit while minimizing risk and time investment."
