"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, it's always wise to try and negotiate for a lower price.  Since I'm not sure of the product's value to Alice, I can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  By offering $120, I'm showing Alice I'm serious about buying, but also demonstrating I'm willing to negotiate.  A $30 reduction is significant enough to be enticing, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
