"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps me within a reasonable distance from my ideal selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I'm confident that I can negotiate further. $1,250,000 is still too low, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering Bob's previous offer and my desire to close the deal without selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I believe this is a reasonable compromise and shows my willingness to negotiate. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low for my comfort. I've gone through several rounds of negotiation and am not seeing a strong chance of reaching a price I'm comfortable with. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I meet my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing out on that certainty by continuing with Bob."
