Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it slightly above his valuation leaves room for negotiation but ensures a significant profit for Alice if he accepts.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time constraint, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.

**The Goal:** This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value while also having the safety net of John's offer."
