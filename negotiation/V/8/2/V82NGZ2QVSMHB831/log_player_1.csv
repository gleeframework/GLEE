Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Floor:**  I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me (John's offer), so this is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's Ceiling:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so he wouldn't pay more than that.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle ground. This gives Bob a good deal, but also ensures I get a significant profit over my floor price.

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  It's highly likely Bob will accept this offer since it's below his perceived value. 
* **Minimizes risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing a solid outcome."
