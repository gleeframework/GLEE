Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, the negotiation is progressing slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies both parties within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer at $990,000 represents a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,200,000. 

It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
