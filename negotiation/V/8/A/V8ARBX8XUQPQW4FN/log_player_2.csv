"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within his budget, he can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counter-offer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within his budget. He's aiming to find a middle ground while leaving room for potential concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a great deal for a product you'll love, so let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal.  While $135 is closer to his ideal price, he's still only $15 away from his budget. Rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering gives him another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's find a price that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to Alice's offer but is still trying to get the best possible deal. He's showing flexibility by increasing his offer but is also communicating his desire to find a middle ground."
