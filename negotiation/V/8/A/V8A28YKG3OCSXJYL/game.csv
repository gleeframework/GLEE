"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $12000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500, which is the highest I can go at this time. ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm at $9000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value and your budget.",10000.0,Alice,5,
