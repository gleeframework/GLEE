"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $17000. Can you meet me halfway?",17000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you halfway. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $18500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's a good starting point for further discussion. What do you think?"
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll reduce the price to $19000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $18500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be more feasible for me.",18500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $19000. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll meet you halfway from $19000 to $18750. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can consider it a fair price."
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $18500, but I need you to agree to a 2% payment upfront, with the remaining balance due in 30 days. This will give you a chance to use the product while also giving me some assurance of payment. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the need for assurance, but I'm not comfortable with the 2% payment upfront. I'm willing to consider a 10% deposit, but I'd like to keep the payment terms more traditional. Would you be willing to consider a 10% deposit with the remaining balance due in 30 days?",18500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to change the payment terms to a 10% deposit. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to ensure I'm protected. I'll offer you the product for $18250, with the full payment due upon delivery. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can consider it a fair price."
"I'm willing to make a final concession, Bob. I'm reducing the price to $18000, and I'll throw in a 1-year warranty on the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the added warranty, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your new offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $17500. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise.",17500.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,"I'm not willing to go any lower than $18000, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I'm making a profit. I'll make a final offer: I'll meet you halfway from $18000 to $17750. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can consider it a fair deal."
"I'm not willing to negotiate further, Bob. I've made a fair offer at $17750, and I expect you to accept it. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if necessary. The offer stands at $17750.",17750.0,Alice,9,,
