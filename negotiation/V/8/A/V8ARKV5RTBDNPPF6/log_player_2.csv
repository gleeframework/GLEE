"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make an offer to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product that will meet your needs. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, would you consider that?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price point of $10,000. I'm willing to take a small risk and try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.  There are still several rounds left, and I can always buy from John if I don't reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product provides. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is my maximum price point.  I could buy from John for the same price, but I've already invested some time in negotiating with Alice.  Accepting her offer allows me to get the product at my desired price without further negotiation."
