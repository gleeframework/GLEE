"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make an offer to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product that will meet your needs. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, would you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product provides. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10000.0,Alice,5,
