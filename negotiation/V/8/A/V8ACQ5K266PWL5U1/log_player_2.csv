{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's too early to accept. $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This price is still within my budget and leaves room for further bargaining."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $850,000 is still a bit high. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but I'm still holding firm on my desire to get the product for under $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still not ready to accept. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have to consider buying from John."
