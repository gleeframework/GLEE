"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $8,000. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, I would like to propose a price of $7,200 for it. I believe this is a fair deal that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on your product. However, $7,200 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $6,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 6500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I respect your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I would like to suggest a compromise. How about we set the price at $6,800? This proposal allows for a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $6,800 is now within Bob's budget of $8,000. While he could continue to negotiate, accepting the offer saves him $1,200 compared to buying from John.  This is a good deal for Bob considering he can still get the product at a price he's comfortable with."
