Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, I can't go below $1,100,000.  This is a fair offer considering the product's value.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,100,000.  At this point, you're better off taking John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 and avoiding further negotiation. You're very close to your maximum budget, and the potential savings from further haggling with Alice are likely to be minimal."
