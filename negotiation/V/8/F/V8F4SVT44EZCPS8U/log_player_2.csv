# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a unique piece with a lot of potential value. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

You know you can get the product from John for $15,000. Alice's offer is the same price, so there's no benefit to accepting her offer. You can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice by rejecting and seeing if she's willing to drop her price, but you're not obligated to do so."
