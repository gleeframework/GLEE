"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd be happy to do the deal for $12,500.  This price still leaves you with a good margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",12500.0,Alice,3,
