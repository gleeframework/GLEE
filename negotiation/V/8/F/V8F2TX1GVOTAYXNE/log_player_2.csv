"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's value of the product, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his budget of $800,000.  $900,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. This counteroffer allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise while still keeping the deal within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's target price. There is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  $950,000 is a compromise between Bob's previous offer of $900,000 and Alice's current offer of $1,050,000. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but is still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,030,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's target price of $800,000. While there's potential for further negotiation, the risk of getting stuck in an endless cycle of counteroffers is increasing. It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John at his maximum budget rather than risking a price that's still too high or a long negotiation process."
