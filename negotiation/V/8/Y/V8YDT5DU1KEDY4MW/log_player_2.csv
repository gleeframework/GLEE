{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $1,000,000, knowing that Alice's minimum is $1,500,000. This sets a clear negotiating range and gives us room to compromise."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum, it's still too high. I believe I can negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  However, it's still below Alice's minimum and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is $1,600,000. While it's getting closer to my maximum, I'm confident I can get a better deal with John. It's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,500,000 than continue negotiating with Alice, as the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential savings."
