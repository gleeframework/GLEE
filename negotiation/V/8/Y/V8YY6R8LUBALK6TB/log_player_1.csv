Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that is higher than Bob's value of $1,000,000 but still offers him a potential profit. 
* This price is also lower than my ""Plan B"" price of $1,500,000 with John, giving me a good chance of making a profit. 
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
