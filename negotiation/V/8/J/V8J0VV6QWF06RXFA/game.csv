"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $12500 for the product.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13250?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. ",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $13250 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12500.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $13000? That's a very fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to meet in the middle. ",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still only able to offer $12500.  I'm confident this is a fair price given my budget constraints.  Let me know if you're willing to reconsider.",12500.0,Bob,6,
