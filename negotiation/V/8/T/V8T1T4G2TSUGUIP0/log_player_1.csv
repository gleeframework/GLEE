"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is $20 more than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer and still leaves me with a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial $100 asking price, Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and we're already nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
