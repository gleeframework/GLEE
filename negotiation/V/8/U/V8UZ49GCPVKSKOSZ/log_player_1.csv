Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing that the product is worth $8,000 to Bob. It's a good starting point to try and get a higher price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe $8,500 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $7,750 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, and I think I can get a better deal than $8,000 by accepting Bob's offer."
