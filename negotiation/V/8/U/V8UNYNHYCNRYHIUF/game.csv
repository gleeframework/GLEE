"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but that price is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I value our negotiations and would like to see if we can reach an agreement.  My final offer is $1,000,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but unfortunately, I can't agree to $1,000,000. I am prepared to pay up to $990,000 for the product. I hope this is within your range.",990000.0,Bob,8,
