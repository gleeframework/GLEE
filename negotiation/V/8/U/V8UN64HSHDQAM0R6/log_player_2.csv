# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
This is a fantastic deal! Alice is offering the product for $200,000 less than your maximum budget and what it's worth to John.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price by negotiating further."
