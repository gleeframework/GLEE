Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1250000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while offering you a significant value. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a price that will be mutually beneficial. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1050000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000 as a final compromise.  This price allows me to make a fair profit while still offering you a significant opportunity.  Let's close this deal and get you started with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
