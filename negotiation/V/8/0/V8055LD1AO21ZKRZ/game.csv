"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $925,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $925,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on it.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $850,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a very reasonable price for the value you'll gain from this product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
