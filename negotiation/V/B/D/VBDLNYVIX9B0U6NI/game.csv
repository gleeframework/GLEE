"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep the price within $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I can't go down to $15,000, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $16,500?  This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a fair price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the adjustment in price. I would like to counter with an offer of $16,000. This still keeps the price within my budget while allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit.",16000.0,Bob,4,
