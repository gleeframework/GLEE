"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Attractive, but not unreasonable:** $12,000 is still within the range of what Bob might consider, especially if he values the product more than he initially stated.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the deal as a good opportunity for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe there's room for a higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can gauge how serious he is about getting the product and potentially push him to make a better counteroffer. 
* **Sell to John as a Backup:** Knowing I have the $15,000 offer from John gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects the significant value this product holds and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and focused on finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $10,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to settle. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe Bob might be willing to go a little higher, especially since he's already raised his offer. 
* **Sell to John as Backup:**  The $15,000 offer from John provides a safety net and allows me to take a risk with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still looking for something closer to $10,250. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only asking for a $250 increase, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also staying firm on my price.
* **Framing as Compromise:** I emphasize that this price is a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Positive and Direct:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and straightforward, focusing on finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $9,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to settle. This is because:
    * **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and he might be willing to budge a bit more. 
    * **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We are nearing the halfway point in our negotiations, and I want to see if I can push for a better price in the remaining rounds.
* **Sell to John as Backup:**  The $15,000 offer from John provides a safety net. This gives me the confidence to try and squeeze a slightly higher price out of Bob, but I'm also comfortable walking away if he refuses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Finality:**  While I'm not entirely satisfied with $10,000, I'm signaling that I'm open to closing the deal at this price.
* **Positive and Direct:** I'm keeping the tone positive and straightforward, focusing on achieving a mutually agreeable solution.

**Considerations:**

* **Rounds Remaining:**  We are in round 7, meaning we have fewer rounds left to reach a deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing.
* **John's Offer:**  I still have the safety net of John's $15,000 offer, allowing me to take some risk."
