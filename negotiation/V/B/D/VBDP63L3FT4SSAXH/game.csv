"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects the significant value this product holds and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still looking for something closer to $10,250. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
