"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($120) as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $85 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $100. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it's a compromise that might be more appealing to him. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to inch closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

While $92 is closer to my target, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round hoping to get closer to my goal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $94.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to get him to close the deal. There are only a few rounds left and I'm running out of time."
