Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that is slightly higher than what it's worth to him. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $120.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $110. Since this is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll offer Bob $125, which is higher than his counteroffer but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115.

I'll offer Bob $130, which is higher than his latest counteroffer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob has rejected my counteroffer again, and he's sticking to his original offer of $115. Since this is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'll reject his offer once more.

I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but it seems like we're not getting any closer to a mutually agreeable price. At this point, I think it's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150.
