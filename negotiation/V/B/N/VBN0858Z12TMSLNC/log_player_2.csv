"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a valuable asset that's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm confident it holds significant potential for you as well.  My initial offer is $1500000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round. I think the product is worth less than $1,500,000 to me, and I'd like to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth less than $1,500,000 to me, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but not that high. I'll offer $1,200,000 for the product.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,500,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I think is a fair price considering the potential value you mentioned."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible and come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000.  This still provides a significant margin for you, and it's a fair price given the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm not convinced that the product is worth that much to me, and I'd like to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer, this time lower than my previous one.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth around $1,000,000 to me, and I'm willing to pay a bit more, but not a lot more. I'll offer $1,100,000 for the product.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I think the product holds for me."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure the price is fair.  I'm offering $1250000. This is a good compromise that reflects the potential value of the product. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm starting to think that Alice is not willing to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with. I'll make another counteroffer, but this time, I'll try to be more aggressive and see if I can get a better price.

Round 6

I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a significant discount from Alice's previous offer.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I think the product holds for me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
