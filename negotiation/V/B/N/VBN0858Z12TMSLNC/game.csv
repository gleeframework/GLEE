"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a valuable asset that's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm confident it holds significant potential for you as well.  My initial offer is $1500000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure it's worth $1500000 to me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which I think is a fair price considering the potential value you mentioned.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible and come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000.  This still provides a significant margin for you, and it's a fair price given the product's potential.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I still think $1350000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to offer $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I think the product holds for me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure the price is fair.  I'm offering $1250000. This is a good compromise that reflects the potential value of the product. Let's work together to close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to offer $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I think the product holds for me.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
