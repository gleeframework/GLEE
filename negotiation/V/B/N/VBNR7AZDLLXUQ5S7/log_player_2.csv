"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $8,000. I believe you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his desired price, and he has a better alternative with John.  He should proceed to counteroffer Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and the fact that I could get it elsewhere for $8,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his desired price point. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and my other options. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,800. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, while also being a good deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's offer of $9,800 is still above his desired price point, and he has a guaranteed alternative with John at a lower price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a better price, but there's no guarantee, and he risks losing out on the opportunity to buy from John."
