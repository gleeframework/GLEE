"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep the cost below $8,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects the value you've expressed and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I really value this product, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is simply too far below the value this product holds.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  I'm open to discussing further, but I can't go any lower than this.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $8,875 for the product. This brings us closer to my budget while still allowing for a fair transaction.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,875 is still a bit low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $9,000.  This is my final offer, as it reflects the value I've placed on this product and allows for a fair transaction. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,7,
