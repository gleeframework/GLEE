Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the initial offer.
* **It's a significant discount:** This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and incentivizes Bob to respond positively. 

Remember, this is just a starting point, and you'll have to adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we settle on something closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's worth exploring if you can reach a more favorable agreement with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?  This would give you a great deal, and still leave me with a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

This counteroffer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise from your initial offer.
* **It's fair:**  $800,000 is a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's offer, making it seem like a fair compromise.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can potentially move closer to his price point while still remaining above your minimum."
