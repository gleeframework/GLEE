"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,500,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above your budget.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to recoup most of the value of the product while still making it attractive for you.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
