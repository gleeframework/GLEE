{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  I'm starting with a price of $950,000. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for less than my floor price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about we try $825000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offer is still below my floor price of $800,000. I'm not willing to accept anything less than my minimum, and I'm still confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll counteroffer and continue negotiating."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still below my minimum price point. I'm not comfortable going any lower.  Let's try $850,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already had several rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to reach a higher price with Bob.  With only four rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high. I'm confident that I can get the same price from John, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on the sale altogether."
